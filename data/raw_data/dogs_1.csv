1,dogs,"Hi all,

On Friday I took my dog to an emergency vet because he was acting unlike himself- lethargic, uninterested in food/walks. The emergency vet ran blood work and found low RBC and platelet count. They sent off a Coombs test which came back positive. 

I took him on Monday for more blood work. His levels increased from 30 to 34 which is good. His energy levels seemed to be going up with the 100mg doxycycline and 10mg prednisone. 

Today (Wednesday) he is tired. He‚Äôs alert and will lift his head up when I walk around the apartment but other than that very sluggish. I just tried to take him outside to go potty and he wouldn‚Äôt walk so I carried him downstairs and he peed right where I dropped him (as a boy dog this is unusual as he usually likes to sniff and pee all over). 

Should I take him to the emergency vet tonight? My next appointment is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:30 but I don‚Äôt want to make things worse by waiting‚Ä¶

2,dogs,"Hello! 

My fiance and I have been thinking about getting a Rottweiler when we get married and move to a new place with a lot more room. She is pretty sold on a Rottweiler. I have some experience with the breed (if you count a mix breed my parents had) and she is pretty researched on the breed. Since we can't get a dog now we've been doing a lot of research in the meantime. 

If we find a place big enough for two dogs, we are thinking of getting a second dog that will get along great with a rottweiler. Some breeds I love and grew up with: German Shepherd, Borzoi, Shiz Tzu, Havanese, Siberian Husky, Shiba Inu

I know the smaller breeds would not be recommend because of prey drive. 

Would any of my favorites minus Shiz Tzu and Havanese work with Rottweilers?

11,dogs,"I've been fostering dogs for over 10 years now, and it's a huge part of my life. I can only take one dog a time, but I've been able to save hundreds of dogs now, and it brings me so much joy. I started fostering after I adopted my dog, Laika. She was just so well balanced, confident, joyful, behaved, and intuitive, and someone had to foster her for me to be able to be matched up with her, and it was the best way that I could think of to thank her. I'm a big fan of pack based learning and I knew that she had the right temperament to be able to really help dogs from all kinds of situations learn how to be a dog. She absolutely loved meeting all the different dogs, and she took it very seriously. She just was so intuitive and knew the difference between correcting a rude puppy and being non-reactive to a scared dog. If somebody stole her bone, she was secure and confident enough to know that we have bones for days here, and it's nothing to get upset about. I never had to worry about any behavior issues from her, and I could rely on her to never be causing problems. She got along with everyone. (Obviously I didn't just bring in a dog and let her deal with them, I just want to explain how her temperament contributed to being a huge help. I thought of her as a partner.) We would go to dog rescue events, and she was always at my side, and I called her the dog ambassador. She would lay down and be very still for kids who were nervous about petting her, and she just acted like she had never had a bad day in her life. She was in perfect health, and very unexpectedly passed away on New Years Eve from hemangiosarcoma. We are devastated and she left a huge void in our lives.

Initially, I thought that I would just continue fostering and just casually keep my eye out for the ""right"" dog. I have another dog, Izzy, who is the one foster dog that I adopted. She was very shut down when she came here, and she just bonded with me. I tried adopting her once, she went right back to being reactive, and she got returned, and I knew that I could give her the structure and stability and safety that she needed. She's a curmudgeon and doesn't *dislike* the foster dogs, but she just doesn't interact with them. All she wants in the whole world is to lay on her spot on the couch and be near me. I never thought that her and Laika were particularly close, I thought they interacted more like roommates who would sleep near each other and keep each other company, but after Laika passed, I realized just how much Izzy relied on her. Izzy has been very depressed, is barely eating, and hardly moves. 

I requested some puppies to foster, because I really, really needed to get snuggles and kisses from some happy, floppy bundles of joy. They healed so much of my heart, and Izzy's responding just a little bit more. But she really needs the stability of a permanent companion. I'm very worried about her. She's not particularly interested in the puppies, other than a passing curiosity, but she's never really interacted with the dogs anyway. 

I have been really considering one of the puppies, but I'm also trying to be very careful to not fall for the first puppy that I meet. But I really think that there's something special there. I requested to have her for one more week after her sister leaves on Sunday, because I want to see what she's like on her own with us. I've also been looking at young adult dogs online. I'm not sure if it would be better to get an adult where you know what their temperament is going to be like, or maybe having a puppy and getting them lots of early exposure to all kinds of things, lots of car rides and meeting different types of people, and getting that training in nice and solid can shape that temperament. If I got a puppy, I think I would stop fostering for a few months so I can get her trained and bonded with us and our pack and not confused by fosters coming in and out, but I'm worried about them not growing up into the kind of dog that I would be looking for if we adopted an adult. 

Right now, I see instincts that look like they would suggest that they would have the right personality. She was confident walking up to me, she's pretty calm, she's always checking in, she plays fairly and will often be the first one to flip over, she will bark and put her paw on her sister if her sister is getting into trouble, etc.

I know that I will never have another Laika. And I don't want to judge another dog against her. That's not fair to them, and I'm sure they will have all sorts of quirky, special behaviors that are unique just to them that I will love. And I'm sure that I'm at least somewhat responsible for Laika's behavior, and no matter what kind of dog we get, there will be lots of adjustment and training. But I still want to make sure that I'm getting a dog that has the core traits that let them be the next ""dog ambassador"" and that confident, well adjusted buddy that will be able to get along with any dog that they meet and be non-reactive.

12,dogs,"Hi everyone, so i‚Äôve been a lurker on this subreddit without joining up until now because I am plagued with a serious dilemma.

My fianc√© and I recently had to stay overnight with my in-laws at their house (hours away from our home) due to celebrating the holidays. For several reasons, we usually avoid the both of them the best we can with the exception of the holidays. Both of my in-laws make lots of money, are affluent and I am very sure can afford to invest in sitters, trainers, walkers or even a boarding facility; they just choose not to. 

My MIL and FIL own three dogs: a male in-tact bulldog, and two chihuahua mixes (a spayed female and a neutered male). It was brought to my fianc√© and I‚Äôs attention that all three dogs are being kept in one plastic kennel shut away in the laundry room with the lights off for likely up to over twenty hours a day. My MIL and FIL‚Äôs excuse is that the dogs, when left alone in their house while at work, pee and poop on the carpet/floors/walls. The dogs are released only for twenty to thirty minutes at most to use the restroom (no exercise, play times or training sessions) before they are returned back into the kennel for the remainder of the day/night. 

My fianc√© and I are very horrified by the treatment of the dogs and agree it is blatant abuse. I‚Äôve been considering calling local agencies to investigate that will hopefully find a better home for them, the issue is I‚Äôm not sure how this would turn over without further straining our relationship with them. We‚Äôve considered offering to rehome the dogs for my MIL and FIL, but we recognize that my MIL would outright reject my offer since she claims she is an ‚Äòanimal lover through and through‚Äô. This situation is also a great concern to me because my MIL discussed the idea for the bulldog to have a litter, which I just through and through one hundred percent do not agree with. 
I recognize that I need to prioritize what is clearly morally right, I‚Äôm just not sure how I should go about it. What should be my next steps?

Any advice would be very much appreciated!

13,dogs,"This sounds odd, but I have a genuine fear of my pup getting older. She is such a beautiful creature and we love her very much. She gets three walks a day, lots of love and we are always making memories with her and giving her new opportunities to experience the world around her. 

However, it is the relatively short life span that fills me with fear and anxiety. 10ish years is nothing. I value her all the more for it and appreciate every moment (even when she‚Äôs been super naughty and trashed the houses lol). Some dogs can live 15+ years. I think that when she gets to 8+ I‚Äôll basically be living at the vets every time she sneezes or misses a meal lol. 

It sounds silly I know - but part of giving them a good life is not flooding them with human anxieties. 

So, for those of you with older dogs, how do you live a life without fear and anxiety? Do you find yourself worrying excessively about them? Want to make sure I don‚Äôt become a nightmare pooch parent lol üê∂

14,dogs,"My 2 year old dog has developed a severe fear of strangers. It‚Äôs really came out of nowhere. She was well socialised and didn‚Äôt mind people coming into our home.

When someone comes in i try to ignore the behaviour, have her in her bed and give her treats every time she stops barking but it is not working and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Today we had a repair man in, it was exhausting. She howled and barked non stop. I had her penned off in the living room with lots of space thinking that whenever she calms down she can come out. Every time she would hear the repair man in the other room she started to bark and growl even after she had finally calmed down. Every time I went to speak to him or he would pass through the living room she would bark. I had to tell her ‚Äòno‚Äô and tell her to go to bed multiple times because I just could not have a conversation with the repairman.

15,dogs,"
My family got a dog for the family when I was around 6 years old. We were excited but eventually I stopped playing with the dog as much and became pretty neglectful of him. While we always made sure he was fed, was inside when weather was bad, and to pet him a bit when he was around, I very rarely if ever played with him that much or walked him that much.we mostly just let him hang out in the backyard. I knew that I should‚Äôve been doing more for him, but even as I got older I never really Improved. Recently I tried to change that and started taking him for a daily walk, and I felt better about how I was treating him. But then suddenly he fell very ill and can‚Äôt do the daily walk anymore,  can barely move, won‚Äôt eat and is vomiting a lot. I couldn‚Äôt even convince my parents to take him to a vet because they just figured they wouldn‚Äôt be able to anything for him so they just bought nausea/vomiting medicine for him. I know he‚Äôs old and probably going to pass soon but I can‚Äôt help but regret the fact that his life probably would have been better if he was adopted by anyone other than me.

26,dogs,"Hello, 

I'm desperate for advice ... 

I (F28) can't remember a day in my life I didn't dream of owning a dog companion. I'm also a cat person, I lived with and owned more that 7 cats in my lifetime. If I should find a cat in the street today, I would know exactly what to do to make him happy and prepare everything for him to have a good life with me... But I have no idea for a dog ... 

I find myself in a difficult personal situation today and it becomes more and more difficult to refrain my will to adopt. I come to you today not to hear that if I do so it'll be hard, I know that but is it feasible for the dog to have the best life he could. 

So I'm in a civil partnership with someone i lived 3 years with and have 2 cats (M3 and F2)that are inlove with eachother. I found a very stable job (french gov) that required me to live at 400km alone in a 45sqm apartment. I'm could come back next year or move 2 times anywhere in France in the next 4 years (depends on my results in tests). He still lives with the cats in our big flat (90sqm) and I come home by train a bit more that every other weeks. We don't have a car, only he has a driving licence (I'm going to prepare it once my professional tests are done). And finally I leave for work everyday at 7am and come back home at 6 and half pm. My psychiatrist and nutritionist both think that a companion would be perfect for my mental health (ADHD and depressive anxiety) but don't know if it would be ok in our present situation. Also we want to rejoin as soon as possible and for that it would be essential that all the animals get along. 

I don't want to pay for a breed, I want to adopt at a shelter or from someone who give one ""for free"" (I would pay for the care) and any dog would please me. 

First, do you think that it's a good idea or I should refrain again and again (the very though is terribly sad) until I'm with my family again. If so, what advice do you have ? I would enjoy all kind ! 

Love for all you dog lovers &lt;3

I live in a large houseshare where 6 people are happy to help with walking and caring for the dog when I'm unable to take the dog to work.

33,dogs,"And I'm really bummed about it. I have a 9 month old Mini Australian Shepherd. I wanted a standard Australian Shepherd, but the rest of my family didn't want a big dog, which is why we got a mini.

I wanted to do some kind of sport even before I got him. Obedience, scent work, agility, disc dog, whatever. But he struggles with the most basic training. He likes toys, but not enough to really work for them. He likes treats, but only works for them if they're super high value. He doesn't care about his kibble, despite it rarely being fed from a bowl.

And I know, I know. He's in adolescence. He's going to regress in his training. But even before then, he was the same. I've worked on simple commands like sit and down so much, and he still barely gets them.

It's like he has the energy of an Aussie, but not the drive. He just wants to run around for a few hours and sleep. I wanted a dog that I could do a sport with. I've tried building drive. I wanted to do disc dog training the most, but half the time he just brings the frisbees away to chew them or gets distracted, even if I have multiple discs or treats.

He's reactive and generally anxious too. He barks at any sound he hears when in the yard or in the house. He barks at any dog he sees and is starting to react to people too.

I mean, everyone tells you that Aussies are one of the smartest breeds. And that they need a job, and need hours of excersice. And I was ready and excited to work him. But he's just not into it.

36,dogs,"Our Westiepoo was totally healthy for her entire life. We only gave her puppy shots and never did any boosters after that. Then there was a parvo outbreak in our area so we decided to get the DHPP booster 4 months ago. (No Rabies vaccine as she was an indoor dog) A month later her personality started changing. Not as happy. She slowly went downhill from there. Balance issues about a month ago. Then the last 2 weeks it got worse. We took her to the Vet 3 times. Finally lymph glands, in her neck, were huge this past week and sure enough it was Lymphoma. Worst day was putting our Sweet Girl down. 

I am not an anti-vaxer but I did run across this article putting out the question if there is a correlation between boosters and Lymphoma.

Their dog is the most hyper being you've ever seen. But also not?

It tears apart everything. If there's something on a couch that you put there, within 10 seconds the dog will be trying to tear it up.

Not consume, but tear apart. And leave a mess to clean up.

Recently (within the last few months according to them) she's been super interested in... the giant bookshelf in the living room.

Today was the worst of it.

They weren't home and the dog went after one of my friends favorite books, something they've had for a long time, something very special to them, and tore it apart.

Because they weren't home.

50,dogs,"I adore my rescue guy. He's nine years old, mostly border collie, loving, fun, and happy.  He enjoys being petted and stroked and many head-scratching sessions a day. Loves loves walks and hikes. 

He's never liked me touching his feet or brushing him. I am not a picky housekeeper at all. The fur ""all over everything"" situation is out of control!   My washing machine filter has globs of fur in it after every wash and then the dryer collects a lot more. My clothes are pretty covered in fur... 

He growls at me whenever I try to brush him gently.  I've tried every style of brush there us, including those gloves. It doesn't hurt him, I can pet him and massage him and he loves it. 

I put a muzzle on him yesterday to try and push through his initial growls. Disaster.  He was livid, growling,  snarling. The muzzle was on his face for less than 90 seconds, all told. 

I'd asked our vet about this a while ago - she just said, ""he doesn't like to be brushed.""

- Temperament. I‚Äôm looking for a fog that is confident and friendly. I don‚Äôt want a dog with a short fuse or a dog that is a breed known to be skittish and sensitive.

Things that lead me to ask for different breed recommendations: 
- Size. Not a dealbreaker, but my favorite dog size is 12-45 lbs. I‚Äôve got experience with big dogs, but would prefer a dog that‚Äôs small-to-medium. 
- Chewing. I‚Äôve heard that goldens tend to have oral fixations, especially the first few years, and chew on EVERYTHING. I know that‚Äôs just typical puppy behavior, but we‚Äôve had a shredder dog before and we‚Äôre not too keen on a repeat that lasts more than the teething period. 
- The crazy years. This may be another size thing, but I know dogs such as labs and goldens tend to be a little nuts until that 3rd or 4th year before calming down. This isn‚Äôt my favorite attribute. 
- Shedding. Absolutely not a dealbreaker, because ultimately shedding is a part of dog ownership a good 75% of the time, but a dog that sheds a little less would be neat. 

I‚Äôve owned a mastiff/lab cross, an adult parson russell terrrier, a senior austrailian cattle dog, and a poodle/spaniel/dachshund mutt who was a foster/training venture.

53,dogs,"I have chocolate lab who's learned how to take advantage of his potty training. When he needs to go out, he'll sit by the door, and whine eventually if I haven't noticed. I live in an apartment in Atlanta, so taking him out each time is a thing; I can't just open a door to a yard. He recently had a tummy bug and got to go out every hour or two, which wasn't fun but obviously he couldn't help it. Since then, he's been sitting at the door more often. I'd take him out and he'd barely need to do anything, so I stopped doing it so frequently and tried putting him back on his normal potty schedule. Now, anytime he's bored or isn't getting attention when he wants it, he'll start chugging water- and I  mean chugging to the point I have to stop what I'm doing, get up and make him stop- and then goes and sits by the door. Trying to keep him on his regular schedule, I  wouldn't take him out as often as he demanded, which has led to a few accidents. Which caused me to actually taking him out now and continues the cycle. And if I don't take him out immediately, after a few minutes, he'll go lay down on his bed so I know he doesn't have to go that bad. Then 30 minutes he'll start the chugging again. I have a second dog who drinks water normally, so I  don't want to just take the water away.

59,dogs,"Today my mum and I took my dog to an enclosed field to run around off leash for a bit. As we got there, I saw this small dog- couldn‚Äôt have been more than a year old- hanging around near us. I was a bit annoyed because I like to carefully select the dogs my dog interacts with, I was thinking *who has let their dog off leash outside the field?*. 

I looked around and realised there was no one else. The puppy was not overly excited so I let the dogs meet and was able to grab the puppy‚Äôs collar. I called the number, and a young boy answered. I tell him where I am, and he tells me to bring the puppy down the road to their home. I pick up the puppy, he is very calm and giving me kisses. I sit down with him by the gate, and try to wrap him up in my coat as much as I can because he is shivering and soaking wet.

15 minutes goes by, no one has shown up. I call the number again, and the boy tells me to leave him there. Right by the main road. He says the puppy will find his way back in through the hedges. I tell him that no I won‚Äôt leave the puppy, and I end the call. I take the puppy to the hedge, and he has a sniff before bolting across the road towards the dog field! A car was coming as he did this, he is so lucky not to get hit‚Ä¶

I follow the puppy to the entrance of the field where my dog is running around, so I think screw it- the pup can‚Äôt get run over in the secure field and I let him in. He sniffs around before bounding towards my mum and my dog. 

Then I‚Äôm like shit, this can go one of two ways (She has never given me any reason to believe she would bite anyone or any dog, but there‚Äôs always that worry with her being so much bigger). My dog spotted the puppy ahead of me, and started running towards him. 

However, she ran straight past the puppy to greet me, before looping back around to go straight to my mum! I am so proud of her. In the end, the two of them had a great time running around, and even play fetch (My girl doesn‚Äôt usually take much interest in toys) 

As we were wrapping up our walk, I tried the other number on the puppy‚Äôs collar. I got through to an adult this time, who said he‚Äôd come right over. He was very grateful and we parted ways. We took our dog around the field one last time before leaving and the puppy didn‚Äôt return so I can only hope he is secure at home.

There are many things I should‚Äôve done differently, but at the end of the day he was reunited with someone that cared about him. I wish I had vocalised better to the boy about how leaving the pup to roam free by a main road wasn‚Äôt a good idea.

My bf and I live together. I came into the relationship with a 7 yr old chihuahua-yorkie and two orange tabbies.) That yappy lap dog is now about to be 10 (he was born on Valentines Day.) We have a one year old daughter. He thought it would be a good idea to get a puppy when she was 5 months old. I already do everything: cook, clean, feed the other pets, work 12 hr shifts as a nurse, make the appts, do the shopping, etc. He started training the dog but never followed through. Once he got bigger and we had a situation at home where he moved out, I had to put the dog outside for the safety of my now crawling baby. I kept the dog, fed him, watered him, brought him in and crated him when it was too cold or raining outside. But he basically moved back in and continued to skirt his responsibilities with the dog. I STILL feed and water him, give h treats, etc. But I‚Äôm too busy with all of my other responsibilities that I can‚Äôt play with him. And he destroys anything and everything in the backyard. He chews on the hot tub cover, the patio furniture, etc. I bought him all these toys and treats for power chewers and dogs that need extra stimulation. But it‚Äôs just a vicious cycle. At this point, I want to rehome him bc he needs a family who can give him the attention he deserves. But my bf is adamantly refusing. 

Maybe I should just rehome them both. Lol

Unless anyone has tips on how I can personally make time for the dog. Because he deserves so much more. Btw, he‚Äôs a pit mix. Very sweet but very ‚Äújumpy uppy.‚Äù He was bought for $80 on the side of a road.

62,dogs,"I wanted to stop by and give some words of encouragement. Seeing your dog slowly go through neurological issues or maybe it happened overnight, there are not many things in life that will be harder, knowing a lot of people care for their dogs as if they are human kids. 

Know this, most neurological issues are not painful, dogs will usually understand their new limits and adjust, and even if you don't think they understand, I truly believe they understand they now need you to function..so this will probably lead to a strong bond.

During these times, especially at the beginning,  you will go through a ton of emotions...either because the doctors have no idea whats going on (a lot of diseases have very similar symptoms), you feel bad for you baby, you may think the world is a cruel place, etc.. Over time, you will slowly come to the realization that your pup is handicapped and accept it but at least he/she is still with you. Take this time to make their life as normal and amazing as possible.

**The biggest point I wanted to get across is that you're doing an amazing job taking care of your pup, and they know it. Life can be cruel, and our fur babies do not deserve this fate but this is our reality. Take time to be sad and cope but get back up soon because your dog needs you and you can still give them an amazing life. Not everyone would take on a challenge this big, being a nurse 24/7 to your pup is a big responsibility, and not giving up on an animal is such an amazing experience. Don't give up, and if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to IM me on REDDIT or reach out to someone. Talking to someone can help tremendously.** 

**Before I go, here are some ways I have been helping my dog stay positive**:

* 1-3 walks a day
* Find out their motivations, and make sure you prioritize them. For example, my girl loves:
   * Walks
   * People
   * Peanut butter
* Look for items out there that can improve their condition
   * Balance issue?
      * Leg brace, buy a wagon so they can still experience walks
   * Look at getting a harness that will allow you to easily pick them up, help them stay balanced, etc..
   * Dog wheelchair
   * Etc..

\-------**My story is below...4 months of dealing with this, I felt like I needed to give back to the community-**\----

Before September of 2022, I had no idea what cancers, or diseases dog could get. Almost every single dog I've known in my life (this includes family and friends), all but one were considered healthy and lived their normal life expectancy...then September 15th, 2022 happen.

A month before my sweet girls 2nd birthday, we woke up to her back legs being weak, head titled down, and back arched. Over the next month, we went to our normal vet --&gt; orthopedic  --&gt; neurologist. Every place we went, we kept getting told ""she's a mystery"", ""I've never seen this before in my X years of practicing vet medicine"", etc... During this time we were given many different thoughts of what was going on:

* Torn MCL's
* Some general orthopedic issue
* Bone cancer (which is pretty much saying your dog is going to die in the next 6-12 months)..this was a brutal 2 weeks. 
* Stroke/FUE
* and finally Cerebellar Abiotrophy (her cerebellum gradually dies off which will impact her balance, posture, and coordination)

Over the last 4 months, we have felt every emotion underneath the sun, but now we are finally beginning to heal. We have a pretty good idea of whats going on, she may be able to live a long life but with her current handicap.

I hope this helps even just 1 person. I had no idea what any of this was 4 months ago, and now I feel like I have a bachelors degree in vet medicine.

64,dogs,"Last month I adopted a ~5 month old puppy. Lab mix, sweet as can be. Loves all dogs &amp; people as far as I can tell and hasn‚Äôt shown an ounce of aggression. Even gets along with my girlfriends cats, gives them space, and doesn‚Äôt chase after them if they start to run away. Very goofy &amp; seems easily trainable‚Äî after a day of asking him to sit when we got to a door he started auto sitting any time we approached one before I even asked. But he is also terrified of the city and we like in Manhattan.

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for the past month because because she has a quiet courtyard &amp; there is 0 chance he‚Äôd walk out my apartment door (I live right on a very busy avenue). He‚Äôs okay walking around the courtyard, but will not willingly go outside her gate. Anytime he‚Äôs been outside, he‚Äôll tremble, pancake to the ground, start crying, or try to sprint back to her building every chance he gets. He hates the car too and will stress pant the entire ride over, so driving him places isn‚Äôt really an option. At first I thought that this was just ‚Äúnew puppy scared of the new city‚Äù but I‚Äôve learned his fears are much more severe. She actually lives in a pretty quiet NYC neighborhood‚Äî side street without much traffic, but he‚Äôs still utterly terrified the moment he sees her gate.

We‚Äôve kept all walks to the courtyard &amp; have been trying to get him slowly acclimated to just *walking* to the gate (not leaving), but this does severely limit how much time he can spend outside. We‚Äôre technically not allowed to walk him in the courtyard and I‚Äôve gotten in trouble a few times, so I have to be sneaky about it. In the beginning I would carry him to a pee spot outside &amp; he would just pee immediately and sprint back. I felt so bad seeing how scared he always was that we stopped forcing him outside of the courtyard for walks.

His fosters told me that they wouldn‚Äôt describe him  as a nervous dog, but either they were lying or the city has worsened his general fear and anxiety to non city things. We gave him a bath the other day and he starting violently trembling the moment we put him in the tub &amp; had his tail tucked the entire time. I slid a small package along the floor at the end of a walk and he tried darting away at the end of his leash. We‚Äôve been working with a trainer &amp; behavior consultant, and I‚Äôve spoken to a VB and his vet about options too. The consensus has been that, because of how busy my neighborhood is and how severe his fears are, it‚Äôll likely be months before I could even *bring him* to my apartment. All this has got me thinking that he might be better somewhere else.

I feel terrible about this. I don‚Äôt want to give up on him but I‚Äôm so worried about making things worse, especially because this is one of the most formative times of his life. He can‚Äôt run outside, go to puppy classes, have real play dates, and everything outside of my girlfriends apartment terrifies him.

Going to sound a bit mad this one but try and stick with me on this one. 

Me and my wife, do a lot of walking down lanes that are pitch black We have a torch and stuff but I have had a mad idea.

What if my dog could have her own torch. Mounted to her dog harness so, she can have her own light and be more obvious to people.

I have had a look on the net and obviously I have haven't seen such a harness (if you know of one let me know), but I have see these dog harnesses that have a lump and a slot for a go pro usually with a raied arm, then I could get a go pro torch mount and have the torch on her harness above but behind her head. 

She is a Terrier size pooch, reason for this idea is that we have quite bright torches (we need them) and sometimes I am using my torch to light her way when she is off the lead and I worry they be bad for her eyes, so I thought if she had her own torch it could be better for her, I also could get away with just wearing a head torch with less intensive light and getting her to light the road up mostly for me, as when it gets dark she loses interest in running in bushes or hunting squirrels and just likes to walk about a meter in front of me. 

My biggest obvious concern is could this cause her harm and could it be considered cruel, because these are not my intentions in anyway.

76,dogs,"So my pup is 6 yrs old, 70 lbs, and we've been together for nearly two years coming up. She's a mixed breed with the largest percent being great pyrenees. So Muffin, my pup, is really really really friendly. She's only shown a negative to maybe 2-3 people who were all strangers. She didn't lunge at them but did growl and bark at them. No movement towards them which is great. But the issue is when she sees people or dogs she wants to interact with. 

For context, Muffin is a huge sniffer. She's an information gatherer at heart. Most of her energy and focus is always on sniffing the area we're at. Or she likes to stop and just watch big trucks, cars, people, etc. go by. She was a big puller but she has a front clip harness that takes out any overzealous pulling. She quickly learned with her harness that she can't charge anything and now instead kinda hops sideways in the direction of her choice. (It's honestly super cute.) 

But she always wants to sniff other dogs. She'll see the dog, become alert, get excited, try to lunge and pull me towards the other dog, and then will sniff them if possible. (I always ask if the dogs can meet since some dogs aren't dog friendly.) Once she can meet the dog she immediately calms down, sniffs them, and is done. She does like to play, but playing with other dogs while leashed (or even off leash) is pretty rare. 

She also does this with people. We live downtown in a city and there's always people out. Sometimes if we're crossing the street and there's someone behind us that she wants to meet she'll drag along behind while looking at the people. If it becomes too much to lug her behind and she won't listen I have to turn around and ask the people if Muffin can say hello. (So far it's always been a yes, and somehow Muffin always finds the people with dogs that don't mind her jumping up on them and sniffing. That's also an issue I have with her.)

Is there any way people suggest to get her to focus more on me and not on others while out? I know she can, and a lot of commands she does know she actively chooses to ignore at times (like sit). She's a brat tbh. A very sweet brat, but a brat. I don't want her to get hurt in any way, and I fear her over friendly personality will cause issues soon. She doesn't instigate any aggression towards other dogs. She only reacts when other dogs get a big aggressive. 

And this is my fault too. I also have fairly poor stranger danger and see it harmless to let her greet others, but I've become more aware of dangers out of my control. Like I know I can handle Muffin, but I don't know if I can really handle anything else. And others might not appreciate having a large dog struggling to get to them and/or their dog.  

She's food motivated but is stubborn and will only focus on the treat and not the command. I've been trying to teach her new tricks; however, as soon as she sees the treat all focus is out of the window. And she rarely feels ""shame"". Most of the time she just sits there and smiles mouth open. So reprimanding her is very difficult. The only way to reprimand her seems to be taking away any sense of affection towards her and that is just cruel since I don't know her previous life before I adopted her. I can't do that.

Any tips or tricks? I've been researching but have found conflicting info on what's the best way to train the reactivity out of her.

77,dogs,"My guy went in for an emergency procedure yesterday afternoon. Actually, it was a series of escalating procedures because he swallowed a mini-tennis ball (goofball-ish size, my guy is a fit 85lbs). I ended up going home for the night after they scheduled him for an endoscopy.  It had been a long and trying day up to that point, and I was running in a high-tension state, but about an hour after arriving home, I got a different type of feeling. The tension was obviously still there, but it felt like there was another layer to it. It came on suddenly enough and made enough of an impression that I noted the time. 
A while later when I got the call from the internal medicine doc that did the endoscopy procedure, I confirmed the timing lined up and that my shift in mood/sensation matched the time they actually got him on the table and started. 
I consider myself an atheist, and I don‚Äôt believe in supernatural things, but I‚Äôm a fan of physics and just how weird the universe seems to be as we continue to explore the deeper nature of things, both micro and macro.

79,dogs,"I'm trying to find the cinderella solution to dog waste removal. I only scoop about once a week or once every two weeks and have two small dogs. I normally use one of the swivel bin and plastic rakes and use the disposable grocery bags to bag. When the scoop is full I dispose of it in my outdoor trash can. My problems are as follows:

1) The swivel bin gets extremely heavy to be carrying around at ankle level while i wander looking for more waste. 

2) I have the same bad back everyone else does and am sore for a day or so after I go pick up poo. It takes me about an hour to check my whole yard and pick it all up. So bending over every 30 seconds for an hour not fun.

3) The plastic rake sometimes just shreds the poo and leaves some behind that isn't gettable, this is fine as it just washes away next rain storm but isn't ideal.

For problem 1 I have seen people use a trash can and scoop individual poops but this would take me more time and effort than currently and I am trying to have less of a problem. For problem 2 I have seen some extended length rakes and solid scoops for taller folk, I am looking into this. For problem 3 I have seen people use a solid scoop but wanted to hear first hand some opinions on rake vs solid scoop. 

In my head the perfect solution is like a small 10 gallon trash bin with all terrain wheels and a long handle I can pull around the yard and fill up so I am not constantly emptying the swivel bin. I have yet to find anything like this online for sale. I found the rubbermade brute but not a model with wheels that would make it bumpy grass backyard friendly. In combo with that I would want a long handle rake or scoop depending on the opinions in the comments.

80,dogs," 

Female mixed breed dog, 6-7 months, around 13 pounds.

Raised on the street, had parvo in December, recovered, received her vaccine on 4th of January.

I think she started having these weird symptoms after the shot, but I'm not 100% sure because I've been taking care of her for a limited time. She does this when sitting, laying down or sleeping. No other weird symptoms, the only other thing she does is that sometimes she will fall asleep and quickly wake up panically, barking and crying.

What could be this?

86,dogs,"I have an almost 2 year old, 62lb Standard Poodle. He‚Äôs massive and extremely tall. I keep him shaggy (like a fluffy black cow).

For all of his life, he‚Äôs had ‚Äúpee paws‚Äù. Due to him being so tall, his pee bounces off the concrete and ricochets on his shaggy paws. This is something I‚Äôve tolerated. I can usually bear with it for about 1-2 weeks before fully washing his paws. He‚Äôs also had terrible aim or gets distracted and starts walking mid pee (he marks like a hundred times). So chance of pee paws is always high.

However, in the last two weeks, he has changed his peeing angle. Now, he no longer has pee paws. He has pee thighs. He is tilting his body so far over when he lifts his leg that he is basically peeing straight on himself.

The smell is absolutely unbearable and requires an immediate bath of his entire lower region. I live in a low grass area (big city), but I try to drag him to an area with no vertical surfaces so that he‚Äôs forced to squat, at least for his first pee of his walks.

He is scheduled to be neutered in April (per my contract), so hoping that may stop this. But I can‚Äôt live like this if it continues! He‚Äôs my family‚Äôs sixth Standard Poodle (by far the biggest one by a good 15-20 pounds and much, much taller) and we have never had this problem before.

I have a physical disability (messed up discs in spine and old ACL injuries), and bathing him (even quickly) takes a considerable amount of energy from me and leaves me in wretched pain for a day or more. Considering I‚Äôm on his third bath this week, I really need solutions.

88,dogs,"Hi,
I adopted a (rescue estimates) 3-year-old small dog, and it‚Äôs been about 4 days with her. 
She‚Äôs from a foster, so she adapted to her new environment very well. 

She‚Äôs housebroken, so she needs to go out for her business.
The problem is she likes to snuggle in her bed in the morning, and she wants to sleep more even if I ask her to go out. 
She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI want to sleep more‚Äù, and even if I bring her out with a gentle force, she won‚Äôt do her business‚Ä¶ and she will wait until the evening or so‚Ä¶. 
Although her foster says they did a morning walk in the weekend, It looks like she likes to walk in the evening, but she‚Äôs not interested in the morning walk so far. 

Is it because she‚Äôs still figuring out her environment?

She holds her pee and poo really long‚Ä¶ I go out often to encourage her to do her business, but it‚Äôs not working well. She would pee once per day or twice at most. 
I‚Äôm little worried if she will develop a kidney stone or some bladder issue. 
She drinks and eats well though. 

I made an appointment with the vet for her checkup, but I need to wait 2 more weeks because that‚Äôs the only available time for them. 

She doesn‚Äôt have a problem to pee in front of me. She just doesn‚Äôt pee often. She weighs about 9lbs, and I expect that she needs to pee more often than once or twice. 

She also sleeps a LOT during the day.. is it normal?

91,dogs,"Hello everyone,

my and my SO got a Silken Windhoud pup in April of 2022. He'll be 9 months old this month. I grew up with dogs, and he's an absolute great pup in many ways: Easy to train, motivated by treats, can practically walk with him off-leash a full hike with him close by and he's a couch-cozy-potato like no other dog i've met or had. He's very gentle around kids and strangers, without being too anxious either when approaching foreign dogs. Pretty much a sturdy mental-mix.

There's two things that bother us a little bit, and i was wondering if other Silken or sighthound owners could weigh in: He's an extremely picky eater, which we sort of knew is the case with a lot of sighthounds. The breeder also said that it is something that runs in the family a little bit, but at this point i think we have gone through maybe 5-6 different types of feeds with him, different types of bowls, lick mats and the works, and he is very inconsistent in the amount he eats from day to day. One day he will devour his daily portion ++, other days he won't even finish half.

We have thought about introducing very strict feeding-schedule with respect to set times throughout the day, but we are also kinda scared indirectly restrict his access to food in turn too, but the idea is to make feeding hours a bit more of an ""event"" than it is now currently. It's also the case that one week he strictly prefers one type of chicken-based kibble for example, but the next will only eat the fish-based ones, or he'll walk away. 
Anyone in the same spot there?  Does anyone have some general tips in how to move forward?

And to my second question:

He's gotten a habit that - * on the dot * - at 7 am every day, he starts whining. He usually is put to bed at around 10-11 pm. Sleeps through the entire night. If i get up and let him out, 9 times out of 10, he just goes to his blanky on the couch and can easily sleep for another 3-4 hours before actually indicating that he needs to go potty. I've tried utilizing earplugs or something to just block the whining out and see if he stops, but he only really increases it in volume after a little while.

As a background, he gets around ~2 hours of outside time a day. One 20 min walk in the morning, an hour+ right after work at 4pm, and then a last one of 20 minutes around bed-time. 

Anyone got any tips to remove this behavior?

The volunteer who helped us said 'it is not a problem, we will only be able to spay her next week now'.... from everything I have read about dog sterilisation and pregnancy, I find this quite concerning, especially at a shelter! So, I am looking for facts please:

If the dog is not pregnant after this incident, how long after a dog was on heat can they be safely spayed? And secondly, how long will it take to do a reliable pregnancy test? (I assume there are now urine-tests for dogs available, similar to humans?)

104,dogs,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice on this topic and am trying to educate myself, but all the information out there on dog nutrition is extremely overwhelming and I‚Äôm struggling to get a grasp of it.

My parents have a miniature schnauzer who will be six this year. His build is definitely a bit larger/taller than the usual, but we have always struggled with his weight and the vet has advised he needs to trim down. 

He‚Äôs been fed a cold-pressed kibble since being a puppy and does seem to really love it, but I‚Äôm starting to question whether he is getting everything he needs from this, or if I need to change to a diet food that will make him feel fuller but still lose weight.   
All the info I read at the time extolled the virtues of raw feeding, but my parents weren‚Äôt willing to do that and this cold pressed kibble was marketed as being like the next best thing, and was even compatible with a raw fed diet. I‚Äôm now reading that raw feeding is not necessarily the best diet for dogs, and that‚Äôs where it all starts to get overwhelming, with all the conflicting info out there.

This is the food he is on:

[https://www.allaboutdogfood.co.uk/dog-food-reviews/0782/gentle-dog-food](https://www.allaboutdogfood.co.uk/dog-food-reviews/0782/gentle-dog-food)  
[https://www.gentledogfood.co.uk/gentle-dog-food.php](https://www.gentledogfood.co.uk/gentle-dog-food.php)  


The food is marketed as retaining higher nutrition than regular kibble due to it being cold pressed, and easier to digest. I trusted the high rating from ‚Äò**allaboutbdogfood**‚Äô, but now worry if their scores are even legit. The quantity of food fed also seems a much smaller amount than regular kibble, but was assured this was because of the way the food is digested, so the dog doesn‚Äôt need as much (this makes it harder to cut down on his food because it already seems like a small amount!). Here‚Äôs the picture they use on the website to illustrate their point:

[https://ibb.co/Zm3C1YF](https://ibb.co/Zm3C1YF)

**‚ÄúCold pressed foods like Gentle do not undergo the punishing high heat extrusion process. This means the food retains more of the key nutrients and ingredients vital to a healthy balanced diet. On top of that cold pressed breaks down a lot easier in the dog's stomach than its extruded rivals helping digestion. As seen in the below photo Gentle Cold Pressed absorbs water very easily and therefore breaks down much faster than the extruded food which swells up.‚Äù**

So, I‚Äôm wondering whether to reduce his food down further to 90g (he currently gets 100g a day), and change his daily small treat to carrot/cucumber. Or, look at completely changing his diet. 

Does anyone have any advice? I‚Äôm really worried about him developing arthritis due to his weight and getting older.",t2_6hgkbeks,0,Advice about cold-pressed dog food and weight loss (UK based),"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},self,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/MYESaYOnsFvLrKgScMgAJYMfbwoVmsRdUGv2PHboPnE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e6cf1ec824e00ee98129cffcde6887a1d6cc4f17', 'width': 560, 'height': 560}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/MYESaYOnsFvLrKgScMgAJYMfbwoVmsRdUGv2PHboPnE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=abb3d4f74ee27dddbaf2188da939e1ff89145392', 'width': 108, 'height': 108}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/MYESaYOnsFvLrKgScMgAJYMfbwoVmsRdUGv2PHboPnE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f4170c7544ea60e4fc1a900830d7ec322493eeaa', 'width': 216, 'height': 216}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/MYESaYOnsFvLrKgScMgAJYMfbwoVmsRdUGv2PHboPnE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c81d7fb9c54426250ccc85075c84e4615f61e5d7', 'width': 320, 'height': 320}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'XNCCgkv1oYjFpmie6jgviDx_T93UGK95zfc-prNnWWQ'}], 'enabled': False}",[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,1091u0y,True,bluebellcrossing,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1091u0y/advice_about_coldpressed_dog_food_and_weight_loss/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1091u0y/advice_about_coldpressed_dog_food_and_weight_loss/,2481069,1673434092,0,,False,1673434106,1673434106,2023-01-11 10:48:12,,,,,

107,dogs,"Hi all, just a peculiar little issue I was seeking some advice on. On the 24th of November my 3yo Malshi was viciously attacked by a neighbourhood staffie that was roaming outside its yard. My dog suffered many wounds around his neck &amp; the region of his front left leg. He initially was limping quite a bit on that leg, not putting any weight on it at all. A week later, we took him to the vet for a follow up - the vet expected the limp to have gone away, but gave it another week to see if it improves. He did start taking some very small steps on it in this period but still mostly limped - at this point, his vet was unimpressed with recovery &amp; decided to carry out some x-rays. The X-rays showed a fracture with slight displacement of the bone, &amp; the vet recommended surgery which would happen a few weeks after. They prescribed us a tranquilliser &amp; meloxicam, to which my dog did not react well to &amp; had diarrhoea for several days, so we decided to give it a rest &amp; wean off the medicines. We opted not to have surgery straight away, &amp; wanted to get a second opinion first. Since then, about 3 weeks later (currently) my dog has started taking full steps on that leg, does not exhibit signs of discomfort &amp; only really limps when he's trying to run at full speed (if taken to the backyard for a toilet break). He does seem to have a different gait when he is walking, but only very slightly &amp; perhaps as a result of only just beginning to put weight on the leg. We are planning on getting a second opinion in the next day or two with urgency to see what another vet would think of his improvement (we have also had a bad experience with the previous vet), &amp; go from there. However, we were wondering - in a situation as such, what would any of you think/do? What are the risks associated with not having surgery considering that there has been definite improvement in his demeanour as well as his use of the leg? Any &amp; every advice is appreciated. We are not necessarily against surgery, but also don't want to put our dog through the perils of the procedure &amp; the recovery thereafter.

We‚Äôre working on crate training, and getting along with his older brother (7yr old doxy mix - Dexter). We weren‚Äôt awesome with training our first dog, but we‚Äôre aware and changing habits and have already seen progress in both dogs. 

We use positive reinforcement only. Crates are never punishment - though we had to work with Dexter because it used to be for him before we knew better. Now, he‚Äôs actually better in the crate than Mason. 

The pups get along fairly well, though they get barky while they play. The older one growls, but he growls when he plays with us too and isn‚Äôt aggressive. He wasn‚Äôt properly socialized when he was young, but has never had issues with other dogs (save for one intact, rude, male bulldog). 

The biggest concerns I have are the little dudes whining and the barking. The two play off each other, and they‚Äôre starting to understand ‚Äúquiet,‚Äù but ignore me when things get too exciting. Mason also has an issue where he was never properly trained at all, and is five months old now, so I‚Äôm not sure what applies to him still. Should I be forcing naps if he gets out of control? Are there specific things I can do (other than just ignoring him) to keep him from jumping up/nipping? Any just general first time bully breed owner advice? Let me know if more information would be helpful!

111,dogs,"I have a small dog (the size of your average pug), mixed breed but she has pretty short legs. She's just about one and a half years old and in perfect weight for her size.

She eats twice a day, and usually gets a treat in the middle of the day between her meals. Meals are always kibble mixed with meat paste (whatever that's called), treats are usually those X shaped ""tooth cleaning"" sticks.

As of yesterday night (about 11h ago) she pooped drops of blood. She did her business as normal and then stayed in the poop pose for about 10 seconds longer and a couple drops of blood dropped out. No more than a paper cut, but still blood.

Today in the morning (about 3h ago) I took her on her walk and same thing happened.

Unfortunately, I can not take her to the vet immediately. She is my parent's dog and they said ""that's probably because she started her period (which she did, about two days ago), if she keeps pooping like that we'll take her to the vet on Monday"".

I'm afraid she might get worse till Monday. As of right now she is not too playful with her sisters, but she still ran when we went on our walk and seems to be feeling alright (no yelps of pain doing anything, I massaged her belly and it didn't seem to hurt her either). I'm afraid it might be parvovirus, which I lost my 17 year old dog to in 2019, but she is actively eating (though not a lot this morning) and drinking water (actually drinking as I write this), though I believe she would be pooping a lot more mucus with her poops if that were the case.

112,dogs,"Our dog (GSD / Lab mix, roughly 11.5 y/o) was diagnosed with late stage cancer in her sinuses 12 months ago. We were told at the time she'd likely only have a few months, but being the stubborn old girl that she is, she's defied the odds and is still battling on a year later. 

She's on pain killers &amp; meds for the cancer, and also other pain meds for arthritis in her back legs (mostly fine, but she gets the odd wobble / spasm in them, which the meds keep under control).

She's also recently started having issues with her front teeth, which due to the cancer in her nose the vets can't really do much about, meaning we've had to start giving her a mix of wet food, powdered dry food, and water, made into a sloppy gruel that she can then lick up rather than having to try and bite anything. It's working, but she's getting tired out with the extra effort it's taking her, so often only eats half a portion so this along with her other issues has caused a lot of weight loss.

She's sleeping a lot. Tbh, that's not unusual for her, but what has changed is how deep a sleep she is in. While she would always be alert to any sounds while asleep when she was younger, now she'll snore right through you walking straight past her head on creaky floor boards.

I know she doesn't have long left. I know the time to make ""the decision"" is getting close, but how do you know when it is time? There's days she's almost her normal self, wanting to play and go for a gentle walk round the block, but there's other days when we wonder if she's even going to make it to the end of the week. 

I know it needs to be done. I know she can't tell us when it's time and needs us to make that call for her, but it's just so damned hard to do it.

114,dogs,"I love my old girl Molly with all of my heart. But sweet as she is, she's as stubborn as a bag of rocks. Molly has 3 indoor beds to pick from, but her nighttime anxiety pushes her outside into the cold. We've tried just about everything to keep her sleeping indoors where it's warm with soft orthopedic dog beds, but if she can't get outside by the time the humans go to bed, she has a full blown anxiety/panic attack.

Molly hasn't always been this anxious at night - it cropped up a year ago, and her vet team has been working on crafting the right cocktail of medications to alleviate her nighttime anxiety. The current theory is that she has an irrational fear of the heater. So, we tried lowering the temperature downstairs (where the dogs sleep) and covering it up with white noise, but to no avail. She's currently on a combination of Prozac &amp; Tradazone, but it doesn't seem to help much.

We think she has ""doggy Alzheimer's"", but the only symptom she has is sundowning panic attacks. Apart from the wee hours of 1 AM - 7 AM, Molly is perfectly content to sprawl across her indoor dog beds, fast asleep and snoring loudly.

The most recent solution is to let her sleep outside, which worked well in the summer, but we recently experienced a cold snap where the temperature dipped into the teens. It's regularly in the upper 20s at nighttime in the winter, and I can't help but fret. Molly isn't a cold-resistant dog by any means; she's a 45 lb mix between a beagle and an Australian cattle dog - think short, bristly hair, not at all suitable for cold weather.

We rigged a crate on our screened patio to have several layers of blanket and tarp insulation to protect against the wind, and she has an elevated cot with an electrically heated bed to keep her tummy warm. She's wearing not one, but two sweaters, and snuggling under two of her favorite ratty beach towels &amp; our most expensive cold weather sleeping bag (rated for freezing temperatures). Last I checked a few minutes ago, her body was quite warm to the touch, and she was snoring loudly under the layers.

Despite this, I can't help but feel anxious. It's 32¬∞ outside right now, and I worry that if she gets up to stretch, she won't be able to wriggle her way back under the covers. Or if she's cold and wants to come in, I won't hear her bark. 

Does anyone have any words of comfort to help me not feel like an awful dog mom?

118,dogs,"So I recently took in a dog from a friend of mine who is moving away. I was happy to get a new dog and the initial meet up went well, the dog (Casper) responded well to my wife, our roommates, and our other pets.

It's only been a month and I'm being patient. When I can see that he is more anxious than normal I don't enter the room he is in. I give him a treat after any interaction where I'm allowed to touch him and I haven't even raised my voice around the dog. I just want to make sure that I'm doing everything I should be, because I obviously want the dog to like me. 

Also, since the previous owner got him from a breeding family (he's and Alaskan Klee Kai) he hasn't been fixed yet and he's pushing a year an a half old. I'm in the process of setting that up but holidays made it difficult. Will that help?

119,dogs,"Hello, my (25 F) 10 year old Chihuahua has began to become aggressive towards me but only when he is around my mom. We adopted him from a shelter when he was about 5 years old and he never showed signs of being aggressive and hardly barked like most chihuahua's are known for. We suspect that he was abused by previous owners since he has always been a bit timid and has a few scars on his face but he eventually warmed up to us after a few years of having him. 

I used to be his favorite person as he would always follow me around and wanted to be in my presence. A few years ago though he started to become more attatched to my mom and has now become sort of protective of her.  None of us have ever layed a hand on him since we all agree that hitting an animal is wrong and a terrible way to discipline bad behavior and he has always been a great dog since he's potty trained and hardly barks. 

During the day when my mom is at work, he is very friendly and loving. He loves belly rubs and sitting on my lap and getting scratches. I feel like out of all the people in our house, I give him the most affection and he loves it, I'm also the one that feeds him everyday. But at night when my mom comes home he goes by her side and if I even get near her or go to hand her something, he will start growling at me and then barking aggressively like he wants to attack. My mom yells at him to stop and yells his name but I don't know if he understands that she's telling him to stop and maybe thinks that she is yelling at me instead. 

I'm not sure what to do about this, I usually just ignore him and don't even make eye contact but it seems like he is becoming more and more aggressive and has starting even biting at my pants. I got a bad dog bite from a dog before a few months ago by and bandmates dog and it was not fun so I'm scared of it happening again with my own dog.

Insurance data indicates that Pitbulls and Rottweilers account for only 25% of dog bite claims. Which is also in agreement with the Ohio State University's Study that shows that Pitbulls account for approximately 22.5% of the most damaging reported bites. Pitbulls account for ~20% of the dog population by best estimates. Showing that pitbull bites are proportional to their population. In fact, their Breed Risk Rate is in line with other dogs breeds out there that are considered great family dogs. So how do pitbulls account for more than half of all dog bites? Agenda pushing misinformation by groups dedicated to hating a breed. Additionally, data from the American Veterinary Medical Association has concluded that no controlled studies have shown Pitbull-type dogs to be disproportionally aggressive. Lastly, Studies have shown that Errors in Identifying Pitbulls Link 2 happen approximately 60% of the time
with shelter staff that spend a lot of time around dogs, so reports in the media about dog breeds are highly inaccurate and hardly count as a reputable source for a dogs breed.
Oh you only see videos of pitbulls attacking? Not surprised.

127,dogs,"So I have a a pit lab (a boy dog) for 4 years now.

About 6 months ago I adopted a German Shepard (a girl dog)

They are the same age remarkably. Both dogs are fantastic, well leveled dogs. No problems at all with aggression no issues like that.

My German Shepard is the alpha (which is not part of my question, well possibly) just explaining. 

So my pitt lab is a human lover. My German Shepard is a dog lover.

So here‚Äôs the part that confuses me.

My German Shepard is obsessed with her bother my pitt lab. 

She shows him so much affection. 

Nibbling on his head, jumping on him giving him a hug, licking him, if he cries she runs over to his aid. I could explain so many ways she loves him.

Although he (my pit lab) is absolutely unresponsive to all of this. If my pitt doesn‚Äôt like something, he will growl and bark, as I‚Äôve seen at the park when he‚Äôs mounted.

My pit lab has even growled at my German Shepard when she mounted him. 

But when she does the licking, hugging, nibbling to him, he‚Äôs just like a damn dead fish with a look on his face like ‚Äúoh well‚Äù.

So what I‚Äôm wondering is and need help with is, does he like it??

I don‚Äôt want to stop it at all, but I just don‚Äôt get it. 

He growls if he doesn‚Äôt like something, so the fact that he‚Äôs not growling means he likes it?

I know he doesn‚Äôt mind it, but does he like it?

My German Shepard is a dog lover, and LOVES his brother, but I‚Äôm not sure about how my pit lab feels? 

They have played wrestled a bit, but I don‚Äôt know how to read the other part.

Have you ever seen this relationship?

Is he possibly just feeling alpha dominated and submitting?

Is he loving the kisses and nibbles but just doesn‚Äôt know how to react?

130,dogs,"Hi all,

My upstairs neighbor got a dog back in November(based on what he‚Äôs said it should be around 7 months old by now) and ever since he brought it home it has been crying and whining nonstop. It goes on all day and continues throughout the night and it‚Äôs pretty loud since the floors aren‚Äôt exactly thick or soundproof. At night I‚Äôve started using a fan just to drown out the crying so I can sleep. If I‚Äôm lucky he‚Äôll tire himself out before starting back up within ten minutes. 

I left a note back in December effectively saying ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt know if you knew, but your dog cries a lot. If there‚Äôs anything you could do to try to mitigate that I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it‚Äù. I‚Äôm trying to be understanding because I get it, I have dogs myself, people work and can‚Äôt monitor their pups all day, maybe they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, etc. Unfortunately, nothing changed. 

After two weeks of no change I went up and talked to the guy personally. Basically said the same thing the note said and added that I work remotely and it can be quite distracting (plus you can sometimes hear the whining on teams calls). I got maybe thirty seconds out of the guy before he just says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and shuts the door. Another two weeks pass and basically had a copy paste conversation, still nothing changes. Even offered to walk it for him for free just to tire it out and was still dismissed quickly.

I've tried redirecting him to a toy when he's bitey instead but whenever we play with him he can't play without biting. I've seen a few videos online on how to correct his behavior such as poking him on the side and saying Sshh!, this worked at first but now he takes it as a game and just gets more rambunctious when I poke him. We've also tried doing what another video said to make an ""ouch!"" sound so he knows it hurts and he stops doing it or at least is more gentle but this also doesn't really work. 

Can someone offer some advice? I know he's still a baby and I hope he grows out of it but I want to know if there's something I can do to get him to be more gentle.

146,dogs,"My dad and I bought a GSD puppy of craigslist 6 years ago. He lived at my parents house all his life, and they have a ton of open land so he can kind of do as he pleases. He stays outside for the most part, but has shelter inside our garage where he can come and go as he pleases with our older dog (lab mix/mut) around his size. They also have 2 indoor, smaller dogs they play with when they come inside from time to time.

About 3 years ago I moved off to college. My dad passed away since then. I am now working full-time a ways away from my parents house.

My sister and mom have stayed at this house and taken care of the dogs since then. However, my mom needs to downsize her house, my sister is moving out to college, and they can't take care of our GSD any longer.

I really wish he could come and stay with me, but my apartment will not allow it and I do not have enough money for my own house yet. If I did, he would already be with me. I could possibly move to an apartment that accepts large dogs, but I do not think he would enjoy being cooped up indoors after his entire life of being outside mostly.. I guess that might be an option. However, therein lies another problem because I am gone for work a lot of the day and he would be cooped up in a little apartment often..

I like the idea of adopting her, and the costs are not a concern. But rather the practicality. 

Does having a second dog bring about a lot more chaos? Do they ever have periods where they have hostility? Does the orginal dog get super jealous? How is it walking two dogs at a time?

There is fur everywhere, and I mean everywhere. I‚Äôve never seen a dog shed this much. I know it‚Äôs normal for her breed, but it sticks to everything. Are there products I can get to help keep my home cleaner on top of cleaning more? 

Are there shampoos/body products I can get for my dog to help with her shedding? I have a furminator brush along with another regular brush and honestly, I have sat and brushed her for well over an hour and a half before and it still keeps coming off the same as when I started.

I took her to the groomers at the beginning of December hoping they would maybe work some magic to help because they had a ‚Äúde-shedding shampoo service‚Äù but nope, still fur everywhere. 

I also unfortunately have some allergies to her (nothing crazy that would affect me too bad or anything, I just get itchy and my nose will get stuffy if her fur gets in my face) and so when her fur drifts onto my bed and such it can be a bit bothersome.

163,dogs,"I just need to vent.

I have a 7 year old supermutt who is my absolute best friend. I got him when I was 16 and entering my first bad bout of mental health. He was literally my saviour because having him made me get out of the house to walk and train him, and he gave me joy and a sense of purpose at a time that I thought life had none to give. 

I got him after seeing an ad online for a ‚Äúfarm dog‚Äù and he was the cheapest listing: $300 (I know, not a good reference to buy a dog but I was 16 and my parents didn‚Äôt know any better). Thanksgiving day he way mine. 

About his breed: when I asked the farmer what breed he was he told me had no idea. He doesn‚Äôt know what dog got his female pregnant, ‚Äúone of the neighbour hood dogs probably‚Äù but that the mother was a border collie lab mix. So we know he has those two breeds for sure. The vet wrote on his birth certificate that he is a ‚Äúborder collie x Labrador x husky x german shepherd mix. A real supermutt.

That being said, Charles, my dog, has crack head energy for real. The only reference I have is a young German shepherd or malinois ‚Äîas this is the only other breeds we had when I was younger‚Äîbut he also has the mentality (drama always) of a husky, stand off-ness of a german shepherd and the intelligence of a border collie. 

The energy is insane, as you can imagine. That was fine when I was in high school because I had all the time in the world and he was my sole responsibility. Now I‚Äôm in my 4th year of university and I can barely meet his needs. I take him on a 40-80 minute walk which includes off leash ball play and freedom‚Äîrecall is 98% not perfect but I trust it ‚Äî and the time depends on my time and tiredness, as many times as I can a week. It‚Äôs always different. Sometimes I‚Äôm great and I do this 4-6 times a week, sometimes I‚Äôm burnt out and I only can manage 1-3 times, sometimes (rarely) in perfect and I manage all 7 days. And sometimes I am so in a hole that he doesn‚Äôt go for a walk for an entire week. 

And that‚Äôs when I feel like absolute crap. He gets anxious, tense, nervous, and sometimes agressive (towards the cats or if other dogs visit the house) because he has so much energy and no outlet. I can‚Äôt even blame him. And it makes me feel so bad that I get so upset with myself and my inability to get shit done (I have adhd, forgot to mention, so when I really can‚Äôt get it done I can‚Äôt get it done).

It makes me feel so incompetent and bad because the dog truly just loves me so much and I‚Äôm his whole life and I can‚Äôt even give him everything he needs to enjoy his life to the fullest extent. 

Just wanted to vent, if anyone relates I‚Äôd love to hear it cause I feel like ass when this happens.

tldr: dog is a supermutt, has stupid energy, my adhd ass is in uni and can‚Äôt always walk him. Big sad feelings for me. Vent over.

181,dogs,"I see a lot of people use the command 'stay' in conjunction with other commands. I don't understand this because when a dog is in 'sit', if it gets up and runs off: it's no longer in 'sit'. The 'stay' is implied. If the dog understands the first command you don't need to say 'stay'. Why do so many people  add the extra command? 

Wondering what you all think.

It feels like I see this often with trainers who give a command multiple times (they'll say ""sit. siiiiiit. *stay*."" maybe the dog sits on the second one, and then as the trainer backs away ""staaaaaaaay, staaaaaaaaay, *staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay*""), but given what I understand about the way dogs learn: this makes no sense. Saying the command once should prompt the behavior - otherwise the dog doesn't understand when they need to respond. The dog doesn't know: Is it required when the command is said once? or is it twice? Only have to listen after they say it 5 times?

186,dogs,"How can I make the time she has left more enjoyable?

She's a 5 year old Leonberger, she was fine by Christmas, 5 days ago she started having a lot of dhiarrea and was generally lethargic. A few days prior my mother had brushed her and found nothing out of the ordinary.

3 days ago my mother went to the vet, since she's usually such a lively dog, there they found a fist sized lump by one of her (idk if there's a better term for it in English) hind nipples and her leg was super swollen.

Today with an ultra sound the vet checked whether or not the cancer had spread and apparently it has already spread everywhere.

(I'm probably not describing it well, I wasn't there for either vet visits, basically, we cannot operate and chemo would only painfully draw out the inevitable)

What is more devastating is that we have a 15 year old Havanesian who we actually expected to kick the bucket first, but shes a beast. She could survive a nuclear fallout.

Anyways, I just wanted to ask what we could do to help our doggo have the nicest weeks of her life. She's getting pain medication and she's moving less but she's still coming for pets and for snacks. The other dogs are getting jealous of the attention she's getting (they're also getting cuddles and snacks dw)

Should we go on more walks/hikes or even Picknicks since she can't move as much? Or would that be more upsetting for her since she can't play as much anymore. I was thinking she may enjoy just being outside and enjoying the little sun we're getting here during the winter.

How can we give her a slightly more special treatment for the last weeks of her life without getting the other dogs jealous? And is it going to be distressing for her if I'm crying more in front of her (I can't help it, we're all devastated) - should I just cry it out in a different room and come back once I'm done? She hasn't really shown much of a reaction to crying so far, but I don't want to stress her out either.

188,dogs,"Hi everyone. We brought home a 10.5 month old Samoyed 1 week ago and he's been great. Loves his crate, isn't difficult, sweet and gentle as can be, adorable. But I'm noticing one issue I just can't shake. 

He doesn't make eye contact with us. What I mean by this is, he never looks directly at us. You know how when we're training our dogs, giving them commands, etc., usually the dog's eyes are straight on you? Not with him. It's as if he is looking just straight ahead, or even down, almost all the time. 

We brought him to the vet the following day after we picked him up, just for a regular check up and he noticed the same thing, checked his neck for any pain, but he was fine.. no pain or anything. He ***CAN*** look up, he just doesn't. For example, I'll be standing in front of him and have a spoon of peanut butter trying to have him make eye contact with me, he *doesn't.* Not until the PB is right in front of his nose that he'll look up to lick it. But I just can't get him to look into my eyes.

If we're eye level with him like kneeling down, we feel like he makes direct eye contact. Or on the couch, he'll occasionally look us and rest his head on our legs. 

But *never* when we get his attention from afar. He just always looks like he's aloof, looking somewhere else except at us. 

I just don't know what to do. Or where to start. I'm being told he's only been with us 1 week, give it time, he needs to trust us, etc.. I'm sure. He's warming up slowly in many, many ways. Not as frightened, going around the apartment more instead of his crate, just being more open with us.

Except the eye contact. It hasn't changed one bit. I feel somewhat helpless in this issue, somehow like I'm crazy, but it's something that is hard to explain until it is happening to you. Just something I never thought about, all the dogs I've seen in my life from friends, family, our own, shelters, they've all looked up at me. A natural thing I never thought twice about. Until now.

192,dogs,"Am I doing enough for my puppy?

My pup is a 12 weak old golden, &amp; I easily feel like I‚Äôm not giving him enough attention anytime he whines when I put him in his playpen to go do something totally reasonable like wash my face. For reference, i decided to get him in between jobs so that i would have enough time to train him, take care of him etc before starting a new job in the next few months.  I live with family right now so things are fine financially, but I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs responsible for training &amp; taking care of him. 

A general idea of my routine with him, to see if it seems appropriate:

6:40-7:10- wake up, go outside for potty. Come back inside, feed &amp; put in play pen for like 15-30 min to get dressed.
Afterwards, we go on a brief 15 min walk around a small park to do all the sniffing. 
Come back home, try to play fetch, tug.  Throughout this time I‚Äôve been doing a little clicker training basic commands.

All in all, the morning involves around 2 hours of engagement through feeding, walks, training, fetch.

Afterwards, 9-11:30- crate time, &amp; usually I‚Äôll go to a coffee shop or library to work on applying for jobs

11:30-12:30/1 - more playing around the yard, fetch in the house, a little training, etc.

1 or 2 -4 (it varies, but 2-2,5 hours for naps in the crate!)

4-5:30/6 - playing in the yard, training

6-8 - nap

8-9/9:30 - playing in the house. 

9:30-6:40/7 - sleep!

TLDR; just looking for assurance that I‚Äôm doing enough, because right now I‚Äôm struggling to strike a good balance &amp; carve out a reasonable amount of personal time, guilt-free.  I am starting to leave for closer to 3 hours for 1 or 2 of those naps, just to work on my job stuff / art / see friends, but i try to be really fair about it.  I also know that in a few months I‚Äôll need to leave him alone for 4-5 hours once I start a job, so trying to teach healthy separation now.  

Tonight we‚Äôre going to puppy training class, to be around other dogs &amp; get some help with the basics.

ALSO. I think it might be healthy to teach him to play a little independently when he‚Äôs awake .  Anytime he‚Äôs up he NEEDS me &amp; cries, but I leave him with kongs, bully sticks, so many toys, etc.  so like, out of those 1-2 hr awake times, it‚Äôd be reasonable to teach him to be okay for like 15-30 minutes sometimes ?    

This is my first puppy as an adult, so kinda new to all this &amp; super prone to self-guilt, but I also know that I‚Äôm still a human being that has to get other things done &amp; I need to figure out a way to do it without feeling like I‚Äôm the worst puppy mom.",t2_3ntpcu0o,0,Am I doing enough for my puppy?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,108lass,True,opossum3000,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/108lass/am_i_doing_enough_for_my_puppy/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/108lass/am_i_doing_enough_for_my_puppy/,2480878,1673385511,0,,False,1673385528,1673385529,2023-01-10 21:18:31,,,,,

Beacause I felt bad for the poor pup (her paw was inflammed and she kept licking it) I went and bought a nail clipper just for her without having no experience in taking care of a dog. The guy at the pet shop told me the instructions on how to do it. It was really stressing me out the fact that I could do damage to the poor dog. What was worse was that her nail was weirdly shaped so it was hard to tell where the nail starts from (I was told to clip it in the middle as thats the safer option). So mustering all of my courage I managed to just barely clip one of her dewclaws cutting it in half. The dog made a high pitch bark at me once I did it. Unfortunately, the ingrown nail did not manage to come off. I was terrified I might have hurt her badly. Until I realised that she was not bleeding or anything. In just a few days, the ingrown nail had come off. But there was one more left. This one was much much harder. It took me a whole week for me to try again. First attempt, I try to clip the nail, the dog cries out and runs away. Second attempt, I managed to clip it and this time the damn nail came out! The dog cried out in pain. I thought I've really must have done some serious damage this time. The dog couldnt stand properly and it was lying down and it was afraid of me at that time. What I saw was a hole in the dog's paw filled with a little blood. I gotta say it felt good trying to help out the dog. We still buddies with this dog even after what I did to her.

After we got her fixed she gained A LOT of weight. She‚Äôs now 70lbs and she hasn‚Äôt grown at all in filling out or any of that she‚Äôs just morbidly obese. We‚Äôre worried she has some kind of hormonal issue that needs to be addressed. When we took her to the vet to get her shots last year the vet just brushed it off took some blood work said it was fine and to feed her less. Even when we were feeding her less she still didn‚Äôt lose any weight. Even when she‚Äôs more active she doesn‚Äôt lose any. We‚Äôre seeing a new vet but I‚Äôm worried about the vet not addressing the issue. If the vet were to say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a healthy weight‚Äù (which she most certainly is not based on everything I‚Äôve read) my parents would take that and say she‚Äôs fine and not help her at all.

I have a dog who just loves ""fabric"" based toys (such as ropes, plush animals, blankets).

If we separate them, he cries hysterically and jumps on the door to get out. It's miserable for everyone.

He loves all other dogs, true to his breed, but this is the only dog he goes completely nuts for. These are close friends we see often, and they can't feasibly leave their dog at home every time.

They do kinda okay with it, but have no sense of urgency and kind of saunter inside.  However, now that we're in the winter months, I hate opening the back door. I stand there freezing and let the heat out while shouting the command to come in. Even if it's open just a crack, it gets cold really quick. I can't simply wait for them to come to the door on their own because they have a grass and poo eating problem (which is a separate issue, they have allergies). If I leave them out longer than 7-10 minutes they'll start eating grass and throw up in the house. 

I'm looking for something that I could mount outside (able to withstand cold, rain, heat, etc) where I can initiate a bell signal of some sort using a remote from inside. Then I'd be able to train them to come in on the sound and let them in when they get to the door.

Lots of old articles out there, looking for updated views on latest/greatest in dog trackers.

Right now I think I'm largely down to:

\- Fi  
\- Whistle  
\- Tractive  
\- Fitbark GPS

I've only just started doing some homework on the topic. Lots of opinions out there, each has been shown to have pro's and con's. 

Looking for WiFi, Cellular, GPS, and perimiter/zone functionality. Bonus is the health features. 

\- Tractive has lowest cost of entry and cheapest subscription. Lacks health features.  
\- Whistle is well priced, and has options between health, GPS, or combo.   
\- Fi seems to win for aesthetics and battery, but also the most expensive.   
\- Fitbark GPS appears to be the only one that works with three different cellular providers dynamically. Have read lots of complaints about others and spotty AT&amp;T coverage (my experience with AT&amp;T is horrible). 

The other big element is how quickly you get notified. I've read conflicting reviews on each of these products on how quick you'll be notified. Yet, this is clearly a very (if not the most) important factor - notify me when my dog is no longer nearby.

TL;DR: 7 y/o female shih-tzu is eating fine but suddenly refuses to drink water, how do I get her to drink water again? (been keeping her hydrated through high water content food)

A few days back (around 3-5 days) our 7 y/o female shih-tzu just stopped drinking water. We've never had this issue before so we're not really sure what to do. At first, she would barely eat anything nor drink water, but since then she's started eating properly again. She seemed like she really wanted to eat, but was having trouble chewing and swallowing. We've been keeping her hydrated through foods with high water content, such as fruit (pear, apples, watermelon, tomatoes), yogurt, vegetables (mainly potatoes), and also by keeping her dog food moist. Her physical condition seems fine, her energy levels haven't dropped and she's acting the same as always. Our main theory as to why she refuses to drink water is that she may have hurt her mouth or throat due to a side effect of an antibiotic spray we've been applying to a flea bite on her tail (she does not like the antibiotic spray and keeps licking at it once we spray her tail). We've contacted her vet and he says this might be it. We're going to be taking her to the vet tomorrow. 

We've tried a lot of different methods to make her drink water again, like changing her bowl and its location, trying mineral water, giving her water in spoons, etc, but nothing has worked so far. We always keep her water fresh and clean throughout the day. Even with the confirmation from the vet that our theory may be right, I'm still worried since although she has no problem eating, she won't drink anything, which is weird if it's truly the antibiotic that's the problem.

When we adopted her she was eating Blue Buffalo puppy food and puking at least once a day. We switched her to Purino Pro Plan puppy formula immediately and she ate fine and stopped throwing up. The vet suggested we do a stool test and it turned out she had Giardia, so we had to treat her for that and she became adverse to eating her dry dog food during treatment, we ended up having to feed her medicine in cottage cheese and then mix wet food into her dry food to get her to eat again.

212,dogs,"Hello, fellow dog lovers of reddit!

I‚Äôm pleased to announce that my partner and I are moving into a decent sized house, with a small yard, and we will be looking to get a puppy in the next 6-9 months. I grew up around dogs (retrievers, mutts, spaniels) but my partner did not. It‚Äôs really important to me that we make the best choice of breed for our lifestyle so that her first experience of owning a dog can be a good one! I did (and am still doing) a lot of research on which breed(s) could be right for us, but I‚Äôd love for all of you who own, owned, or have experience with these breeds to chime in. I‚Äôll share what breeds I have in mind for us, but first‚Ä¶

What we are looking for in our dog:
Size: Small to Medium, preferably under 40lbs at most;
Shedding: She would prefer hypoallergenic, but I‚Äôm ok with light to modest shedding (hoping she doesn‚Äôt see this!);
Barking: Some barking will be ok, but we are not looking for a dog that barks like a guard dog or talks like a husky;
Temperament: Affectionate with family and kids, and open to other dogs (realizing this depends a lot on training and socialization, but a breed that doesn‚Äôt make this feel like a sisyphean task would be great)!
Trainability: As I stated earlier, I did grow up around dogs so I have some familiarity with training, but this dog will be the first time I am solely responsible for training. With that in mind, an intelligent dog that is trainable is preferred - I am up for that challenge!
Energy level: Medium to high. During the weekdays we can guarantee the dog a daily run of ~3-5 miles, and multiple walks of around 30 minutes. On the weekends, we can guarantee a hike or walk through the nearby parks (half day) when weather permits. Ideally, the dog will be able to do weekend camping/backpacking trips with me once it has reached maturity.
Mental stimulation: Given that I wfh, I‚Äôm ok with a dog that leans more ‚Äúalways needs a job to do‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcouch potato‚Äù that sleeps most of the day. Additionally, depending on the breed, I would be open to specific competitions such as scent/nosework or agility courses.

Anyways, without further ado - and a sincere thank you to those who have read all of this - here are the breeds we are considering:

1) Lagotto Romagnolo - this breed seems to check all of our boxes, but it is rare in the US so the price tag of getting one is my biggest deterrent.

2) Schnauzer (standard or mini) - this breed seems to check most boxes, although I do have concerns over their temperament towards other dogs and stubbornness towards training.

3) Silken windhound - I only recently came across this breed, but I am very intrigued by what I have seen and read. I think they might be a smidge too tall for my partner but that isn‚Äôt disqualifying. I‚Äôve never owned or had experience with a sighthound, however, so any sighthound owners please chime in!

4) Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier - A friend of mine‚Äôs parents have one (the only one I know) and she is an angel. I have never owned a terrier. My main concern with a SCWT is their barking.

Sincerest thank you to all who took the time to read all of this and further thank you to those who chimed in!",t2_2pjim2g3,0,Looking to finally get a dog!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üêï Info'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üêï Info,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b73c0a2a-7395-11eb-8f23-0e49dc47565b,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,108ib53,True,SportsAndPoliticsGuy,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/108ib53/looking_to_finally_get_a_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/108ib53/looking_to_finally_get_a_dog/,2480854,1673378490,0,,False,1673378509,1673378509,2023-01-10 19:21:30,,,,,

Decided I‚Äôd try a flexi lead with my 2 year old golden, because I want to give him a bit more freedom and let him sniff on walks.

First time using it was today and it was amazing! Much less stressful and frustrating than with a normal lead. I usually use a 2m lead which is great but he does pull a bit at the start of walks. I have trained him since he was a pup and he does walk nicely 80% of the time but that 20% when he doesn‚Äôt is frustrating.

But the real value was just letting him walk that extra little bit away from me and do his thing. 

He could walk in the mud and smell all the bushes without me having to walk right beside him and get filthy.

Decide to suddenly turn back because you sniffed something interesting? No problem, now I don‚Äôt get yanked the other way. I can let him sniff and just keep slowly walking until he‚Äôs done. 

Wanna dip your feet in the river? Cool, now I don‚Äôt need to risk getting pulled in.

I will say that I‚Äôll only be using it in wide open areas like in the park and hiking, and not when I‚Äôm walking around town in close proximity to other people and dogs, roads etc.

I have two biothane long lines which are great, but they‚Äôre a pain in the ass to use, get caught and tangled on things, and I‚Äôve had them drag on dog shit one time too many to be bothered.

I‚Äôve read that flexi leads also teach the dog that leash tension means freedom, but I‚Äôd argue that the amount of tension on the leash isn‚Äôt much more (if not equal to) than the weight of a heavy duty lead hanging from the dog.

I didn‚Äôt encounter any other dogs today so it will be interesting to see how I can handle that with the flexi as we never greet on leash.

I‚Äôve also got the official flexi brand one and it‚Äôs the tape version and I‚Äôm very aware of safety risks. 

So far very happy!

My dog kept his leash manners and didn‚Äôt treat the extra 8 meters of freedom as ‚Äúomg time to run around and go crazy‚Äù, he actually stayed quiet close most of the time.

214,dogs,"On Saturday I adopted a 1 year old Dutch Shepard from my local SPCA. I have a lot of previous experience with GSDs and Belgian Malinois so after speaking with the SPCA behavioral specialist and interacting with him for an hour, it was obvious he‚Äôs very friendly but hyperactive and needs a lot of physical and mental stimulation (both of which are limited at an overcrowded shelter) and had the typical behavior of a puppy that never learned good manners (hard pulling on leash, jumping, play biting). Both I knew I could handle.  I run marathons and go for miles long walks around the city, hike ect. I only had 24 hours until the hold would expire so within that time, I scheduled the first appointment available with a highly recommended trainer to come to my home for an hour and do a one on one assessment and then book whatever training was recommend. This was 2 weeks from now. It wasn‚Äôt until the next day when I was literally leaving the building with him that I was told that when tested around other dogs, he showed aggressive body language and became stressed / hard to control. I live in the city which they knew and was not thrilled I was told this as I was walking out the door with him. I would‚Äôve desperately tried to find a trainer that only used positive reinforcement that could start sooner to no avail. 

Anyways all the neighbors love him who have met him and he‚Äôs very friendly and excited to interact with people in general. There are a few people who have dogs in our loft building but the ones I encountered I made sure I told  them of the situation with his dog reactivity and they had no problem with it as they know to walk the other way as I do and we all securely leash our dogs. It hasn‚Äôt been a problem when both dogs are on a leash and controllable. When on walks if I see a dog coming in our direction, I use a clicker and treats to distract and go in another direction. I bought an expensive tactical harness that really helps me control him when pulling but doesn‚Äôt hard him. 

This morning when returning from our walk, we were on the second floor long walkway that has a railing after going up the outdoor stairs case . A neighbor (who I never saw or met) let a loudly barking and aggressive acting Maltese dog out of her apartment without any leash. This dog came charging at us down the walkway. The neighbor just said ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs friendly‚Äù. I yelled back ‚Äúmy dog is aggressive toward other dogs. Grab your dog now!‚Äù she didn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt even run to grab her unleashed dog to stop him from getting to my dog. She just casually walked down the walkway. We were trapped in this walkway and this happened so quickly I didn‚Äôt have time to try to unlock the heavy metal door that leads to the staircase. Not to mention Cairo was already stiff and hyper focused on this charging aggressively yapping dog. The Maltese when right up to Cairo‚Äôs face. Thankfully Cairo didn‚Äôt bite but was freaking out hardcore. It took everything I had to control his body as he wanted to follow the Maltese. The owner stayed in the staircase door with her unleashed yapping dog and apologized but meanwhile the incessantly barking Maltese just made Cairo freak out more. As I‚Äôm holding Cairo tightly I calmly said ‚Äúok can you please take your dog downstairs as my dog is very stressed out and reactive to your dog.‚Äù Which she then did. 

The Maltese owner did not have a leash on her whatsoever so it‚Äôs not like her Maltese escaped out of her loft door before she was able to put a leash on. Plus she didn‚Äôt seem to think it was an issue as her dog charged at us down the walkway. She apparently lets her aggressive (in terms of charging at people/dogs while incessantly barking) Maltese out on a busy sidewalk in a city that‚Äôs very dog friendly (meaning other leashed dogs.)  Not to mention that our street is connected to an expressway thats high traffic. 

Also just for anyone wondering - my loft is very large and open. I also have a very flexible work/life balance and am extremely active. I was approved to have this dog (sent photos and info) by the landlord and Cairo is very people friendly. I would never bring a people aggressive dog into a city. Regardless I had always planned to have him trained with a professional and the long term goal is to make him a Good Canine Citizen as he‚Äôs very intelligent. I wasn‚Äôt told of his dog reactivity until I was literally walking out of the SPCA building with him. He has never bitten another dog but shows aggressive body language and freaks out around other dogs especially if that dog approaches while barking or running at him. So to me that means he‚Äôs dog aggressive as I‚Äôm taking zero chances until we complete professional training and his dog reactivity is gone. Our city has very strict leash laws for the reasons above. If you can‚Äôt control your dog it‚Äôs potentially very dangerous to both that dog and/or other dogs/people.

216,dogs,"Let me start by saying I'm really not sure how to approach this on my own and plan to take her to a trainer for some hands on education for us both.

My dog is 3.5yrs old. Female, Shepard mastiff, 65#.

We live in the country and she's glued to my hip 100% of the time. Indoor and outdoor, she's off leash and supervising literally everything I do. 

Any time I try to ask her for ANYTHING outside of her usual tricks and commands, she malfunctions.

She just wiggles herself around until finally laying down, belly up, seemingly expecting a reward or praise for this...

Now, I have not rewarded or encouraged this, but I also don't know how to make it stop (she's not being punished in any way, the training just stops when she won't stand up...)

This has resulted in almost no training outside of basic manners. She is surprisingly incredibly well behaved. Doesn't jump, doesn't bark (outside of a SINGLE 'someone is outside' bark), has incredible recall and is just an angel with other dogs. Her best friend is a 12# cat.

Anything I try to teach her outside of what most would refer to as ""tricks"", she's good.

That being said...I have a few questions.

1) What is this behavior trying to tell me? Does she not like the tricks, is this her saying no?

2) Is she bored or annoyed with the particular tasks I chose to ask her?

3) What is the best course of action moving forward? Getting her in to see a professional trainer is sounding like my best option rn. Also, I'm going to be asking them about agility training to provide that simulation for her.

217,dogs,"Hello!

My husband and I just adopted a 10 months old spaniel mix (at least that's how the shelter described her lol) this past Saturday. When we did the meet and greet at the shelter she was very timid and was shaking. After 5 minutes with us and some treats she stopped and was completely fine with us. The shelter explained to us that she was brought in by animal control in December as a stray and was then placed in a foster home. She ended up getting a lot of applications for adoption so they brought her back to the shelter this past Friday night so people could meet her. She also was spayed about a month ago so she has been through a lot in the past month.

When we brought her home she instantly jumped up on our couch and made herself at home. It has only been a few days and she loves cuddling with us and has no problem eating or playing with us inside our home.

The issue comes with taking her out to go the bathroom as we live in an apartment on the 3rd floor and don't have a private backyard for her to use. She leaves the apartment willingly and it isn't until we reach the ground floor that she starts to shake and get timid. She has no trouble going to the bathroom at all but she just gets so scared with all the sounds going on outside.

As soon as we're back in the apartment her tails a waggin and she's ready to play and cuddle like nothing ever happened. I've tried taking her favorite treats with us when we go outside but she will refuse to eat them until we are back inside.

Any tips for getting her to be more comfortable outdoors? Or should I just let her be and she'll adjust on her own in due time?

218,dogs,"Hello all! I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had similar experience as to what happened with my dog yesterday. 

I have a 5 year old male goldendoodle. He has no health issues and has been housebroken since he was about 4 months old.

Yesterday morning, I woke up to the sound of him throwing up. This happens every once in awhile as he likes to eat sticks and usually ends up barfing them up in the middle of the night so I didn‚Äôt think much of it - but when I got up to clean up the vomit- I noticed he had also peed a large amount on my bed and carpet as well as pooped on the carpet.

The vomit did not have anything in it, just bile. The poop was normal consistency. His routine has been normal (haven‚Äôt changed his food recently or anything like that) and I took him out before bed like usual the night before, and everything was normal.

I called his vet and they did not seem overly concerned, just told me to watch him and bring him in if he threw up again. 

He ate both his meals as normal yesterday and did not throw up again. His poops have stayed normal. He ate breakfast this morning as normal.  

My question for you all is - does anybody have any idea what might have caused this random accident? Has this happened to any of your dogs?

Despite this, she‚Äôs been extremely agitated and some days it feels like she needs constant attention/stimulation. Usually if we acknowledge the barking she‚Äôll run up to us with a toy. If we give in and play, she stops engaging after a few minutes and just barks at us again. I have no idea what she wants and she‚Äôs extremely persistent.

233,dogs,"TL;DR: We've rescued a dog who is petrified of shadows, and we're completely lost on how to help him. We feel like complete shit, and we're not sure what to do.  

6 days ago, my partner and I started foster-to-adopt with a 3-year-old dog called Sam. For a bit of context, Sam is a 40kg Old English Sheepdog who is deaf (the vet has confirmed this has been since birth). From what's known about Sam, it seems he hasn't had a great life prior to coming into the rescue. He doesn't know any sign language, he isn't sure how to greet other dogs well etc. These were all problems we were expecting, and we are happy to deal with. He is really wonderful, and has done incredibly well settling in. Despite what he's been through, he's the most affectionate, sweet, smart, adorable boy and he is basically an absolute star.  

However.

Prior to bringing him home, we were told he has some sensitivities to shadows/lights/reflections. After enquiring a bit further, we were told he reacts to them but can be comforted, and that this would probably improve once he had settled in his new home. To cut a long story short, we are now really worried we've bitten off way more than we can chew. Sam goes absolutely bonkers when he sees reflections from cutlery, light coming in at the sides of the blinds when a car drives past, and sometimes even his own shadow. It seems mostly unpredictable apart from mostly happening at night, and when he can become so upset he is essentially inconsolable. 

So far, we have tried:

Distracting him with treats, distracting him with fuss, sleeping with the lights on, turning all the lights off, making him a den, shutting him in our bedroom, letting him have free run of the house...the list goes on. So far, nothing seems to work and he ends up really upset regardless as we inevitably mess up and trigger him. 

After reading about shadow chasing obsessively over the last few days, I'm now terrified that this is not going to be resolvable. I've seen various discussions/videos about things like Canine Compulsive Disorder, and all anyone seems to say is that you need a behaviourist as soon as possible. However, there's not much mention of what the prognosis looks like. I am also really unsure of how much longer we should give Sam to settle in before seeking a behaviourist. For example, he hadn't chased his own shadow until last night, so what other pieces of the puzzle might we be missing? 

My feelings about this are all compounded by needing to get the rescue's approval before getting any outside help. We've fed back to them about this, and the response has largely been to reduce the reflections/shadows as much as possible and to give him time. However, both me and my partner feel incredibly anxious about this. Today after finishing taping cardboard over the glass panels in my front door (where Sam keeps retreating to at night before usually getting startled by passing car headlights), I burst into tears. I don't know if should trust the rescue's advice and give it more time, or whether they haven't appreciated the seriousness of the problem and all we'll be doing is giving him more time rehearse these behaviours and become more scared. 

I feel sick to my stomach when I think about going to bed tonight as I know we're probably in for another horrible anxiety-filled few hours until Sam eventually runs out of energy (until 4am, when he might wake up and start again if he sees something). We're both working full-time at home, and this is honestly consuming us. Neither of us want to give him back but we can't sustain this without some sort of hope. We both feel like dirt for even considering it, and desperately want to keep him, but things seem really bleak. 

If anyone has any words of advice or comfort I'd really appreciate them. We have been desperate to get a dog for years, but we've waited until now when we're settled and thought we'd be ready.

237,dogs,My dog (2 year old male shiba) has started becoming seemingly infatuated with eating his own poo this last year or so. Potentially even our other dogs as well although I‚Äôm not entirely sure. I thought he may have a deficiency of some sort so I started giving them some multivitamins with their food and that seemed to work for a bit. I give him the ‚Äúnasty habit‚Äù chewable to try and prevent it but nothing seems to work. It‚Äôs pretty bothersome because I don‚Äôt particularly want him licking me with a poop mouth. Does anyone have any tips on this?

246,dogs,"I have 2 small male dogs - one is 1y and the other is 10y. My 10y/o has pretty bad separation anxiety when I would leave the house, but it has since gotten better since I got the puppy ‚Äî not being TOTALLY alone when I'm gone. When I first got my 1y/o, 10y/o was not happy. He never got aggressive but would groan if he got too close and would move away.  He just always seemed annoyed and grumpy, not aggressive. They are much better now, I even think he begrudgingly likes him. 1 y/o on the other hand loves my 10 y/o, is protective of him and loves following him around. 

My 1y/o is crate trained, but my 10y/o isn't. When I leave the house, my 10y/o has access to a few rooms but 1y/o is crated. This weekend I had to leave the house just for 30 minutes to an hour and wanted to see how it would go if I let them BOTH have free reign in a closed off room. I set up a camera to check on them while I was gone, and I would only be a mile away if anything went wrong. 

I pulled out of the driveway and went just down the street to park and see how they were doing right away. My 10y/o was expectedly distraught, whining and crying as he usually does when I first leave. My 1y/o was confused I think, but it looked like he was following him around and nuzzling him to try to calm him down. Then all of a sudden, they start taking turns humping each other! 10y/o would start it, 1 y/o would get away and then try to hump him back. Not gonna lie it made me laugh cause they just kept going back and forth. But I am wondering if it's something I should be concerned about. 

In the 6-8 months or so I've caught my 10 y/o hump the puppy a few times. It's almost always when I walk outside the door to take out the trash or something‚Äì they watch me from the glass door and I can see my 10 y/o hump the puppy for a few seconds. I yell at him to stop and he stops right away. This time on camera is the first time I've ever seen the puppy hump him back though. 

What is that about? Assuming something about trying to establish dominance. Neither of them seem to get aggressive, maybe just slightly annoyed. In general they don't fight, my 10 y/o gets frustrated sometimes but overall they get along fine.  I'm just wondering if it's a bad sign, if it's a precursor to fighting or something or something I should pay more attention to or if it's harmless. Should I continue keeping them separated when I leave the house?

250,dogs,"I'm so frustrated with my mother and I'm out of ideas for how to help the situation. My family owns an amazing, wonderful 13yo dog who is the light of all of our lives. I love him so much, but he's also been ill due to both the natural effects of old age, hip dysplasia, and a degenerative neurological disease for several years. His condition has been deteriorating very quickly over the last year and he's now in very bad shape. He can only stand for very short periods of time, constantly appears to be at best uncomfortable during good days and at worst in pain during bad ones, frequently falls, has had seizure-like episodes, etc. Basically, he's clearly reached a point where his physical quality of life is too low to ethically keep him suffering, and while losing him is going to break my heart, I also love him enough to not want to see him suffer anymore.

My mother won't let him go, though. I've tried everything. I've tried appealing to her myself many times. I've tried getting her to bring him to the vet and hearing him tell her that his quality of life is low. I've tried having the trainer I work with regularly call her and talk to her about when it's time to let an elderly dog go. I've tried gently pointing out to her on a daily basis the times when our dog is clearly showing signs of pain so that she can't ignore them. But nothing works. She keeps saying that the time will be soon, but she's been saying that for months and our poor dog just continues to suffer more and more. I think it's really unfair to him to keep him in physical pain for so long and that we have a responsibility to let him go when it's his time, which unfortunately it is, and to not force him to hang on despite having a low quality of life because it's difficult for us emotionally.

251,dogs,"My wife and I adopted a second dog in September, to have a playmate for our first dog (Rufus). He‚Äôs a one year old pit bull mix named Koda. I love both my dogs, and treat them as if they were my kids. Koda and Rufus hit it off as playmates right away. Koda is a great dog, playful, loving, and has a special place in my heart. But on three occasions, he has bitten. None of the times has anyone required medical attention, they have all been relatively ‚Äúlight wounds‚Äù but all three broke the skin. The first two times I believe was from him reacting to pulling on his collar, so we bought him a harness. Which we thought would solve the issue, the last time, I believe he was resource guarding a couple of large bones, my cousin walked into the room and Koda got him in the armpit. We‚Äôve consulted with a professional trainer, and under normal circumstances would go that route, but my wife is due with our first child in a few months and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good situation for anyone. I know Koda would never hurt me, but there is a possibility for our daughter to get hurt. I don‚Äôt want Koda to be in that situation either.

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so forgive me if I'm not doing it right. I don't really know where else to turn, so thought I'd ask for opinions and advice.

I have a 16 year old black lab cross, who I love dearly. As she's gotten older, she's become deaf, her joints have all seized so has difficulty walking and in the last few months has become incontinent. She doesn't appear to be in any pain (aside from the joints).

I just wanted to know if I am being selfish, because I love her so much by not doing 'the kind thing' (I can't even type it out). I know if I take her to the vet, at this point they will suggest itnisnthe best thing for her, but I also cannot bear the thought of being without her.

254,dogs,"I have a 2 year old Labrador Retriever and he's been with us since he was just a month old. 

Lately I've noticed an aggressive change in my dogs behaviour (this almost after 10 months, I returned from college for the winter break.). Whenever I try to pet him (especially on his face) he starts giving a low growl, he also turns his face away and I can tell by his ears that he is not comfortable with me touching him at all. This behaviour is especially apparent when he is in his bed to an aggressive extent. Even approaching him with my palm out he starts to growl.

This did not use to be the case at all, he always used to be a bit annoyed when I use to pet his face but he never growled or turned away.

Some context , while I was away my family did had to shift houses because of Dad's work. He also had a Minor leg injury from which he has almost  recovered from. All of this makes me suspect that this might be a temporary change. The move was quite a big change for my dog especially since he's only been in that one home with the same people his entire life.

However I am still concerned that it could be a sign of a bigger problem. His diet remains unaffected, he still loves food a ton, always greets me and my family with a ton of enthusiasm every time we come home (even if we are gone for just 30 minutes). His playtime has gone down partly due to his injury and the fact that I am not home nearly as often. Still his peeing and pooing routine is regular.

I guess all I want to ask is should I take him to a vet right away or wait and observe him more ? Has anyone else here had a similar experience with their dog.

I was grooming my 11 yo amstaff yesterday and noticed that her back reeks of urine (and something even more nasty, no idea what). 

The scent is only present in the middle of her back, her lower back, tail, belly, as well as legs all smell normal. 

This is not the place she can reach to lick herself, nor can she splash urine here on accident.

I have checked EVERYTHING because I thought she might have peed somewhere and rolled in it, but no. All clear. No signs of dog or cat pee anywhere. Moreover, if she did in fact rolled in urine, the scent would've been present on other body parts. 

Gave her a bath yesterday, she smelt great, but today the odour came back. 

There's no ammonia breath present, no symptoms of any kind. Overall, a healthy active dog despite her age. The only skin/coat issues we've head was some dandruff from a shampoo but it's long gone.

261,dogs,"Hello! 

I have an automatic gate at my home when driving in and out. Recently adopted an older dog that doesn't respond too well to commands, is very energetic breed and has been living in a flat before (not much running room or many walks either). All has been well and he is very happy now, but he started running outside on the road and god knows where when the gate opens. Comes back within half an hour to two hours, but anything can happen and he isn't scared of cars either.. I have to go to work, so I can't chase him for hours and try get him back. 

So I tried to teach him in different ways, get him on a leash when going in or out, positive reinforcement with treats when he doesn't go, but as attentative as I can be - I have neighbours who also use same gate.
Sometimes he doesn't even come on leash as he knows it means someone is going through the gate. He is clever in a cheeky almost bad way in this case. 

I have been looking into electric collars, if he goes certain distance then it would send sound signal, vibrate and eventually a small electric signal. I would reinforce not going to gate with positivity aswell so maybe eventually he might not need the collar. However none of them seem suitable for my needs, I only want to ""protect"" the gate area and nothing else, as he has hectares to run around and be free, so putting a ""diameter"" would mean he could barely go around the house so that gate is within good distance.

Has anyone come accross any solution, where it would only give the warning in collar and an electrical impulse in certain area only? Digging wires in ground would also be bit of an issue, so was hoping something more ""wireless"". 

I had one collar with button who does it when pressed, but think it's quite weak as he didn't feel anything through his thick fur (didn't even bat an eye), and testing on my skin it wasn't bad either. 

Any suggestions appreciated, as my heart breaks when he gets on the road.

For example he started to make petting movements with his paws when he wants belly rubs. He also started to use his paws to grab your hand and place it exactly where he wants to be pet.

I'm chronically ill and developed about half a dozen serious conditions till I got him. Currently I'm extremely ill. I asphyxiated stomach fluid when I slipped off my pillow mountain when asleep and afterwards doggo started to spend the nights snuggled up to me in a way that makes slipping off the pillows impossible and when I fall asleep during the day I wake up to him snuggled up that way.

Since the current flare up collection happened doggo spends all day close to me, seriously protests my leaving the bed to watch a few episodes of Star Trek every day and refuses to walk any more than nessecary to do his business with me (I need to get others to walk him because he goes as far as digging in his heels when I try to give him some exercise).

After I held him close during the New Year's fireworks he started to place a paw on top of my body most of the time, especially when my symptoms get severe.

I'm beyond livid.  
There are two things people will remember you by when you die - your name and your ethics.  
I'd personally rather die than trade in my pride, morals, and ethics for greed. My once reputable breeder? Well, they clearly tossed those all out the window.  
I found out that my breeder has decided to trade in their ethics to produce ""doodles"" aka poodle mixes. I'm absolutely sick to my stomach over it.  
At this point I can only pray that my dog's pedigree, titles, achievements, health testing, ect is more important and holds more weight than the fact his breeder has clearly lost her fucking mind.   
I have intention, a dream, a goal, of having a small stud service (approved females to studs of the same breed).   
He's my first dog. I did so much research over the course of years before choosing a breeder I felt met everything/the majority of what I was looking for (OFAs, health testing, ect, longevity in their lineage).   
And now we have the cards stacked against us.  
Someone just kill me now. üò≠  
My boy turns two in a few months. I wanted his joints fully developed before diving into competitions, after hearing about some freak incidents, ect. Just my way to insure him, basically.  
I feel beyond cheated and inconsolable. A friend of mine basically said it was ""fixable"" if I also show him and that it'd just take more work proving him since his breeder has lost her marbles.  
I feel like she smeared shit on his name, without a care, and that pisses me off tenfold.  
I just hope my friend is right.

They don‚Äôt go inside the house and just play outside so we don‚Äôt have a lot of experience actually training a dog, etc., apart from feeding them.

Our house and backyard are medium sized, medium sized dog preferred! We don‚Äôt want too large a dog because of the space, for my grandparents, and brother. There is a dog park 10 mins walk away from our house, so we‚Äôd be able to take him/her there.

Long story short she gave him away. That person gave him away. Gave him away. Gave him away. In a span of 2 years he changed about 5 owners. I even heard he was on the streets at some point.

I can't decide. While I love dogs, didn't want my poodle but love having him, and would have ten dogs if I could -- they are a lot of work. Finances aside, what should I expect if we have a third dog?

I'm unsure also if genders matter and if we need to think of a girl or boy dog. Two males now. Comment on that would be nice also.

She now is severely food aggressive and guards her food dish even when empt(we pick it up now but she will guard the area still) , snaps at my dogs when they're getting attention from me, and if I get up to move she nips at me and visitors


While even in my Canine behavior courses I was taught that dogs aren't vindictive I'm REALLY struggling to belive that with this dog. Because of the issues above I have tried everything to train her, positive reinforcement because of her over excitement with food I had to eliminate treats as even when trying super hard with getting her to take them gently I've been bit WAY too many times, I've tried having her on leash when around my dog as she is so nippy and nothing is working except separation.

We have a HUGE problem with cutting her nails so she squirms and Screams anytime we touch them(which we HAVE TO do her nails since hers are so thick and they curl really bad.) recently my boyfriend actually lost it  on because of her doing this even though I have NEVER gotten the quick on any dog. We use the clippers and the dremel and both get the same reaction 

A d NOW we have having a problem with her being so lazy she's now relieving herself in the house regardless of being let out as often as she can dream of. 

I'm at my wits end with this dog and all my boyfriend says is ""oh that's just how she is"" and it drives me up the wall, she is a huge problem and now that our baby is 4 months old she's starting to crawl and I'm absolutely terrified that she's going to hurt my baby. He won't take this serious at all and it's breaking my heart. 

I tried as soon as I was pregnant to introduce baby clothes, smells and furniture so she could get used to it prior and even still she will not even look at the baby(I don't shove her in her face, but the second she sees the baby or hears her she just leaves, where as my other dog just love s the baby. While I can understand why she acts like that and I appreciate that she creates space between her and the thing she's nervous of I don't get it because shes met 10 plus babies and absolutely adored them but mine? Nuh uh 

The hard part for me is she is clearly a problem dog,when told no verbally with nothing else done she shakes like she's been hit(I will never do that and my boyfriend never Has either) her owner on paper will not work with her and even after all the hard work I've put in trying to build a bond with her and train her out of these behaviors for well over a year she still poops on all my things(no one else's) is snippy and rude and just an all around bad dog. I love all living things but at this point I can say I truly do not care for this dog, am I wrong in my approach with her? I'm just so lost and scared that she's just ""stuck"" like this. I've never not bonded with an animal nor not been able to train it. I'm just stuck and looking for some advice or at least encouraging words because I want to give up so bad. But I know that wouldn't be fair to this dog

Is there anything I can do or should I be pushing to rehome her somewhere with someone more qualified.

I‚Äôve searched for 2 days now and couldn‚Äôt find anything online similar to my situation that just happened,  and was kinda wondering if anyone else has had the same issue. Friday 1/6/23 the apt was finally kept after months of being rescheduled (tester having Covid on and off) being the main reason. Moving past that we met, the tester wouldn‚Äôt even get out of the vehicle and just kept texting me, and saying ‚Äúwhen ever your ready we can get this test started‚Äù umm ok myself and my dog were out of my truck, and I didn‚Äôt even see the tester. So moving past that (I thought the test was to be conducted inside the pet friendly store Low‚Äôs) instead of this being done inside the store (keeping in mind it was 20¬∞ Outside) the Tester wanted to do the test in the parking lot?. NOW we were taking the CGC test NOT the CGCU test, but fine what ever, well My dog passed EVERYTHING, until it was time for the tester to get the ‚Äúneutral dog out‚Äù. From the get go the testers dog was low growling at my dog and very distracted, the tester walked the dog up to mine and it‚Äôs Low growl went to a Medium growl (my dog wined back). Immediately the tester Rushed the ‚ÄúNeutral dog‚Äù back to the vehicle and told me ‚Äúwell your dog won‚Äôt pass today‚Äù me stunned I asked why?, and was told your dog needs more training around other dogs (rolling my eyes but ok). Also (keeping in mind I‚Äôve spent over $2,000 in training) and my dog sees a trainer regularly for advance training I was shocked this person even had the nerve to say this when The ‚ÄúNeutral dog‚Äù had the issue from the get go. I asked how the testers  dog passed the CGC test then since the ‚ÄúNeutral dog‚Äù was growling at my dog, (tester laughed). Handed me my papers and told me to try again in a month. UMM OK? So since I Drove over a hour out of my way and, and it wasn‚Äôt even noon yet I decided to say in this bigger City and shop at all the PetFriendly stores, well randomly at one of the PetStores we stopped at (guess who was there). The tester with the ‚ÄúNeutral dog‚Äù being used for the CGC test we had taken about 2hrs earlier. My dog walked fine around the crowd (keeping in mind it‚Äôs the first of the month so the store was quite packed) My dog Set to be pet by everyone even kids. (Tester saw ALL THIS) the testers dog how ever was growling at everyone, and being a outright ass being highly reactive to my dog AND other dogs in the store.

281,dogs,"We rescued an ‚âà 1.5 year old German Shepherd this year. They told us he was crate trained- I‚Äôd say they were half right. They found him as a stray S√¨ we don‚Äôt know his background. 

He seems to go through phases with potty training, but very inconsistent leaving us with at least a couple accidents a week on a good week, much more on a bad week. When we‚Äôre up and moving he will go to the door usually even touch the doorknob of our front door. However, when we sleep has been the most recent issue. He used to whine and tell me and I would get up and take him, but all of the sudden he stopped that and will just go on the floor and then come bedside and wake me up. His stool seems healthy and during the day when we‚Äôre home he seems to be able to hold it for a minute. He was recently sick and COULDNT hold it and had an accident in the floor and that seemed to have set us back. 

We have tried letting him sleep out of the kennel as well as in and he‚Äôs pottied inside the past four nights in a row. It‚Äôs like it started overnight. There‚Äôs no question he knows he‚Äôs supposed to go outside. I fear using a bell because he loves going outside and every time there‚Äôs a single noise (if we‚Äôre up and moving around) he will go to the door. 

I‚Äôve tried to wait until he fully vocalizes to take him out, but he usually won‚Äôt. He knows to sit and stay by the door so he will just do that and he doesn‚Äôt know the command speak. With the exception of crying SOMETIMES beforehand but lately he won‚Äôt even do that.

284,dogs,"My dog is 6 years old and we have recently moved house. 

In the previous home, she was house-trained and used a pee pad. She gets twice-a-day walks (9 am and 10 pm), but she still randomly pees throughout the day. I assume it is for food, as my parents would feed her for any good behaviour.

In the new home, we tried introducing the SAME pee pad at a location but it didn't work (we also tried treating) She would always pee somewhere else, on the floor, on carpets, even on my bed (she used to sleep with me). So I increased her 2 walks a day to about 4 walks (9 am, 1 pm, 5 pm and finally one at 10 pm just before bed) 

There is this one carpet in the room that I kept closed (doesn't have any furniture yet except the carpet that I kept away because she kept trying to go on it instead of the pee pad). However, when we open the room she would rush in there to pee on it. Doesn't matter if she had just come back on a walk or was due for her walk soon. 

Methods tried: 
Stop her walk to focus on housetraining.

Leashed her to me to watch her movements but she didn't have any telltale signs and would just pee on the spot. If I kept my eyes on her she would just lie in a corner or bring a ball. When I turned my head it was a goner.

Kept her in a cage big enough for her pee pad and a rest area. She would avoid the pee pad and even pee on her bed.

I have also tried using the command ""go potty"" she listens very well when outdoors and at my parent's home. But doesn't work in our new home, surprisingly still does all tricks that were taught (sit, sit pretty, rollover etc)

We have bought urine eliminator spray and cleaner to deter marking. And just purchased a keep-off spray. 

It also seems like she prefers the pee pads as her bed and it's driving me a little crazy as she would rush for that specific carpet no matter how many times we spray it down.

295,dogs,"So, I went back to work today after 2 1/2 years of being remote. That‚Äôs 2 1/2 years of being with my dog every single day, almost all day long. Even before then, for 2 years prior to the pandemic, I would come home during lunch to see him/walk him. I always lived within a few miles of work so I could do this. 

Now, I live in huge city and my job was remote for so long, I thought it would be okay to live somewhere affordable instead of nearby work since it didn‚Äôt look like we would go back in for awhile. A potentially hour long commute one way and a bridge I would cross when I got to it. 

Well, the bridge is here. I went to work today and set up my little camera to make sure he didn‚Äôt destroy the place. I checked nearly every hour, and he sat by the door ALL DAY LONG. He only moved when my boyfriend came to walk him for me. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm so sad. It‚Äôs all I thought about all day. Luckily my work schedule is flexible and I can work remote for 2 days out of the week, but the other 3 days, I‚Äôm going to be obsessively checking the camera.

297,dogs,"We took our Rottweiler, Bear, in for a wellness check last Friday as he wasn't himself on New Year's Eve -- he wasn't eating or drinking all day and ate/drank very little on New Year's Day. I noticed some hard lumps under his jaw, but since my family couldn't really feel them, I thought I just imagined it.

The vet noticed them, too, and actually said that all of his lymph nodes were swollen to almost golfball levels. They did a biopsy, and we got the results today: lymphoma. Estimated lifespan: 4 - 6 weeks without chemo.

I'm not sure what to do at the moment. We're all heartbroken and have spent the whole weekend crying. I'm looking to take time off work to take him in for an oncology visit as soon as possible but just based on what his vet has told us, chemo might be off the table for him because of pre-existing health issues and his general health and age (he'll be 10 in August and has a history of having benign tumors and bad reactions to medications). At this point, I'm leaning toward steroids for comfort and whatever else we can do for him to be happy and comfortable, but my parents are considering just putting him to sleep to avoid prolonging any suffering. The vet says we have to make a decision within the next couple of days to stay ahead of things, but I don't know how much time we'll actually have left because of how it's progressed in the past week and a half. Bear's at the point where he can't eat his favorite kibble anymore, and we have to feed him wet dog food a bit at a time by hand since it's too painful for him to lower his head too much or open his jaw too much because of how swollen the lymph nodes in his jaw have gotten. He's gone from finishing his food in under 3 minutes to needing to eat two smaller, softer meals twice a day for 20 minutes each time.

I love him so much and I don't know what to do. My dad had a dog as a kid that had lymphoma and, due to a lack of money and resources in the area he grew up in, had to basically watch his dog waste away from the disease. I couldn't bear to make our baby suffer just so that we can keep him around longer, but I'm also not ready to say goodbye so soon. I knew he was getting older: he's got arthritis, he sleeps most of the day, and he doesn't tolerate colds or bad weather very well anymore, but I always thought he'd pass peacefully in his sleep or be one of the lucky few who lived an amazing, double-digit life. We've had him since he was eight weeks old and being able to raise and care for him and love him has been a blessing, and I'm so grateful my dad brought him home all those years ago.

I've been thinking all day that the vet must be mistaken -- he's been more like his usual self this weekend (getting excited, following us around the house again, and gaining his appetite back), but the biopsy results don't lie.

I'm not entirely sure why I wrote this post. I guess I'm just looking for some advice and stories from people who've gone through something similar. If your pet had lymphoma or another terminal illness, what decision did you ultimately make? If you chose steroid treatments, how did your pet handle them? Do you have any recommendations on how to make the most of things?

307,dogs,"Me and my husband  got a new dog about 5 months ago.  Her name is Beans and she is a Pitbull American Terrier. My older dog is about 10 pounds and a mutt. Her name is Missy. 

Missy fights with Beans. Everytime they fight, I intervene. Break it up or whatnot. It got to the point I went to the vet today, seeking help. My vet told me to let my 40 pound pitbull fight my 10 pound mutt. They said it was about dominance, and they absolutely had to fight it out. 

So... today.. I let them fight. It felt wrong. It felt stupid but I trusted my vet. 

Beans (pitbull) is covered in cuts. I need to clarify that Beans is only 8 months old. Missy (mutt) is 4 years old. They fought for maybe 15 seconds before I couldn't handle it and had to do something. 

Beans had Missy's neck in her mouth. She was shaking her like if she was a dead animal. The fear in my body is unexplainable. I thought missy bad been killed. I tried so so so so hard to get Beans to let go. For almost a minute Beans didn't let go of Missy's neck. Eventually she did, but I honestly thought she killed Missy. 


I don't know what to do. I really really don't. I've never had this problem before. I'm exhausted and scared. I've been to the vet and I've tried my hardest to train them

Please. If anyone ANYONE knows what i should do, please let me know. I can tell you how long I've cried over this. I just want my dogs to get along. My pitbull NEVER starts it. She finishes it tho.

308,dogs,"My sweet Montana is 12 and some months, a black lab/pit mix‚Ä¶had her since she was a pup. While she has progressively slowed down the last couple of years, for the past few months she seems to really be taking a turn.

While she still likes her treats and will get up to eat (as well as use the bathroom) she spends literally all day laying on her bed sleeping. When she goes out she comes right back inside and back to bed. She has no interest in walks, being outside, toys (never really was a toy-dog much anyhow) or doing pretty much anything. She also has been bumping into things a lot and seems to have a slight loss of coordination.

I took her to the vet, and they found her blood platelet levels are very low- but they aren‚Äôt sure why. Next steps would be a specialist, x-rays/ultrasounds, etc. Nothing seems to be wrong with her eye sight despite all the running into things.

My husband thinks it‚Äôs time to just let her go. We can‚Äôt really afford to start doing lots of crazy medical interventions and testing and medications- I have this gut feeling it‚Äôs like trying to make the wheel spin backwards and would cause more stress to her and our family‚Ä¶emotionally, physically and financially. 

But, then she comes and puts her lovely, grey face in my lap and looks at me with her big brown eyes and I wonder if I‚Äôm wrong, we‚Äôre wrong‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt know.

309,dogs,"I am a dog breeder, and the breeding season is over for this year's so I decided to foster a dog. I specifically said no pitbulls, as breed restrictions and just general dislike of the breed. She was listed as the perfect dog for me. Lab mix, Gentle, Dog-friendly, Child-friendly, and overall a amazing girl. ""Loves children and cats and loves dogs too!""

Her name was Ari. We got her after a 4 hour transport, and she settled in. We thought she was a little off looking. Not the same as her picture. Eh, whatever, still a sweet dog? Right?

For a couple days, yeah! Friendly with our breeding stock and our kids. We were actually looking to adopt a pet dog, and she seemed perfect. Then it happened. The bite.

My 7yr old was playing with her bird toy, moving her arm around and making tweet tweet noises. Ari didn't seem agitated at first, sitting next to us on the couch on the other side of our living room. She got up and started standing, tail raised high as a telltale sign of annoyance or dominance, and watched my child intently. My boyfriend isn't as experienced so he didn't notice.

She watched Clementine for a few moments longer, than bit her and wouldn't let go. My child was actually pretty calm, being taught at a early age to disinterest a dog. The dog still held on, dragging her across the room and shaking her. My boyfriend tried the 'wheelbarrow' tactic used for dog fights, but the dog turned and snapped at him. Found out later she was a pit bull and the shelter told me they were really desperate. Won't adopt from a shelter again.

310,dogs,"So my partner and I own a 2 year old Chihuahua rescue (he was approximately a year-ish when we got him).

Since we've returned though he's reacted to me (and only me) incredibly fearfully. He snarls if I offer him my hand to sniff (I am not attempting to touch him at the moment), and overall gives incredibly nervous body language if we're in the same room.

My family is made up of me and my wife, two year old child a 5 year old male shorkie we had when he was a pup and also a new 16 week golden retriever female we have had for about two months now. 

Writing this post as our 5 year old shorkie male does not like our golden, when she tries to play with him or go up to him he always shows his teeth and tries to bite the air Infront of her to go back. Slightly concerned as he is becoming a bit more aggressive, I believe he has anxiety. 

Whenever he was little and we went to the dog park to socialize he would do the same thing, run away from all the dogs and show his teeth to bite back. 

He is a lovable dog but we feel that ever since we got the new pup he has felt miserable and sits in other rooms by himself. We always show affection to both dogs when they are in a room together to know they are equally loved. 

We crate the golden retriever as she is a pup but our shorkie sleeps in our bed,would crating the shorkie even if during the day help with any anxiety.

332,dogs,"Hi everyone, 

I have an almost 3 year old cavapoo who is pretty perfect but has one small niggle - she will only go to the toilet on grass. Our back garden is two tiered, the top outside our door is decking fenced off. Then a gate down to grass bottom tier. 

We let her down to the bottom a couple of times a day but would love to get her trained to go on the decking (will admit it‚Äôs mostly for our convenience, especially as it‚Äôs winter and freezing, but when it rains she‚Äôs reluctant to go down on the muddy grass and so isn‚Äôt peeing as much as our other dog. Bit worried about her bladder. Also the bottom garden is a little less secure). Even on walks she will only go if there‚Äôs grass. 

So far I‚Äôve tried a slip of artificial grass but she wasn‚Äôt really interested.

Some info I considered might affect it: 
- Other dog is a 9yo male. He goes on the decking but also on the grass so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything to do with her not wanting to go where he does. 
- She doesn‚Äôt drink an awful lot and sometimes has days where she will have 2 wees total, our male dog drinks everything in sight and goes about once an hour! Do females hold it better? She doesn‚Äôt seem dehydrated and this isn‚Äôt a recent change, been like this forever. 
- the decking is new, however previously it was a concrete patio and she wouldn‚Äôt go on that either.

336,dogs,"So I adopted a 1 year old (ish) lab mix a few weeks ago, and I've been working with her on a lot of different things and shes getting better at them all. The only thing is that because of her puppy attention span, and lack of socialization with the world, I'm not sure if it's appropriate to be strict with loose leash walking right now? I've been kind of on and off with it but since I'm not consistent and let her pull a lot obviously it's not teaching her anything. I read that if you let them pull just once, they will remember getting away with it and you'll go back to square 1 with training to loose leash walk. As of right now she knows to circle back to me but not to walk slower. One day when I tried to be consistent the entire walk, she got really frustrated and pulled more and more every step in every direction with a running start and it was difficult to get back to the car. Even having her sit and lie down to calm down didn't help for more than 5 seconds once we started walking again. She was just done with the leash the rest of the day.

I feel like I should wait to train her to walk better on the leash until she is more socialized. All she wants to do is smell everything and see everything BUT the more walks we go on the less she has to stop and smell something so that's good. Although we only go on walks along trails at parks as we live right by 2 huge parks in our rural area. We drive there because theres no sidewalks so not sure where else I can walk her to get her desensitized to things. I haven't taken her into a petsmart or any store yet because shes definitely not there yet. She for sure would pull towards everything and grab stuff. So we are limited on desensitizing her in that kind of environment until she stops pulling (and also is solid on ""leave it"").

He is super neurotic. Wants to be outside 24/7, even in the snow. Freezing rain. Or hell. Even thunderstorms.

I do want to add ive known her for about a year. She has finally just started being with me permanently. Over this time we have bonded. Her life before me was extremely unstable, very toxic &amp; abusive. So from the beginning  ive made it a point to show her that im a safe person &amp; will be no matter what. Shes has been able to put alot of her trust into me but she just is extremely traumatized from her past. I made a promise to her &amp; myself that id never let anything happen to her again. Its another story but i know exactly why she bites when a hand is by her mouth &amp; trying to control what she can do with her mouth. Its sad that she has become this way but unfortunately it cant be an excuse because hygiene is necessary. She really needs to have it cleaned daily at the very least but i havent been able to clean this area as much as i see its needed because the biting is really frustrating to me.

Ive done some research &amp; the only suggestions i can find is to muzzle her which isnt going to work because thats the area that must be cleaned. I thought maybe there might be a muzzle out there that allows you to clean long mouth hair but i haven‚Äôt found anything like this so far. Its so important that i can make cleaning her mouth hair actually doable. Also im aware its gonna take some work but at the very least i need to help her get to a point to where she cooperates &amp; if i can get her to like it even that would be a miracle. A good thing to note too is that she will barely take treats in general &amp; when she is stressed or frightened it will not happen at all. Ive never had a dog not motivated by treats before so that has been another learning curve with her. I really hope theres other ways of doing this &amp; a way to make it better for her.

Me and my cousin saw a dog on the way home. We stopped and was told what had happened by my sister. The poor dog was dumped along the road. I had my cousin stay with the dog and comfort it while I went to go retrieve my phone to call the number on the collar. We called it, and we quickly found out that the only number on the collar was for the dog's rabies vaccine. On the other line, we met (lets call him V for vet worker) V. I told V all of the information I knew about the dog. It was a pitbull mixed with another breed which I couldn't figure out. I read off the tag number, and he told me about the dog's owner. Me thinking the owner did that, I didn't really want to talk to them. Reluctantly, I gave them a call. On comes an old lady voice, yet I had been told the guy who dumped the dog was a guy. I told the lady all that I knew about the dog, except for the name. She immediately said, ""How did little old Tiger get down there?"" She lived across town! Me hearing the name, knowing this is the right owner, I then said I didn't know. Turns out that someone stole the dog, then dumped the poor dog along my road. I waited for about 20 minutes for her to come get the dog, and she didn't match the description I had of the dog dumper. She had a white car, dumper had a black car. She was a short woman, dumper was a tall man. I was delighted to know that I got the dog back to the right owner.

354,dogs,"Hi there,

Looking for some breed recommendations¬†here for 2 adults with a cat.¬†  
This dog will be our first dog, and I'd prefer to go with a reputable breeder for some level of predictability. I will also consider getting a dog under 1 y.o. from a foster family if the dog was socialized around cats and doesn't show signs of abuse.¬†  
Overall, here's what¬†I'm looking for in the priority order:  
**Good with cats**  
We have an adult male cat and we love him to pieces, so our top priority is to make sure he is safe and content. No kids though.  
**(Moderately) active lifestyle**  
I consider myself active but I'm also fine to just¬†chill with a book on a couch. Right now I walk¬†5k daily, and I'm willing to walk more with a dog. I live steps away from a dog beach and an off-leash dog play area (unfenced), so we can go there. I expect 1.5-2 hrs of daily walks/exercise. April through October, I regularly go on mountain hikes, paddleboard, kayak, bike, swim, backpack, and would love my future dog to be a buddy in those activities.¬†  
**Healthy / long(er) life expectancy**  
The fewer potential hereditary¬†diseases the better. I just want a healthy happy dog, please.¬†  
**Personality &amp; training**  
My ideal dog is smart, easy-to-train, biddable and affectionate. I¬†know I'm gonna love it very much, so I'd like to get loads of love in return :)¬†  
I'd like to teach it basic obedience and I'd be curious to try agility too - and if I enjoy it, I'll stick to it.¬†  
I don't want a destructive dog, I expect some mess from a puppy but I don't want our place to look like a wreckage. We're renting an apartment, so a breed that is not overly vocal is ideal.  
**Care &amp; grooming**  
I can handle shedding and I'll brush my dog, trim nails, clean ears, etc. whenever needed. It would be great if we don't have to go to groomers¬†regularly, but oh well, I guess we'll manage if we'll have to.¬†  
**Size** doesn't matter much as long as a rather spacious apartment is enough for it. I'm assuming a medium-sized dog might be a bit easier to take care of, but I don't have a very strong preference here.¬†  
**Appearance** doesn't matter to me, but my partner doesn't like poodles / doodles.  
Personally, I'm looking at a cocker spaniel or a golden retriever, but can't decide which is better, plus maybe there are other less obvious options out there?¬†  
Beagle seems like a good dog but I'm worried they can't be off-leash, and it seems that their personality is a bit more independent and stubborn than I'd like but I might be wrong.

I‚Äôve been brainstorming some things I can do for a vacation this year but I‚Äôm coming up empty.

I want to be able to bring my dogs because I would not be able to enjoy myself alone on a trip somewhere as well as I would be thinking about my dogs the whole time and just would be wishing they were here with me the whole time anyway so I want to bring them. We‚Äôre also a bunch of homebodies and the last vacation time I had I just stayed home for the week and hung out with them. It was great. 

What are some ideas? Honestly all I can think that would be fun is like some sort of a resort. Like I have seen dog boarding facilities that treat it like a full blown hotel for dogs. But I want something like that but also for humans. I wanna take my dogs to a resort that I also get to stay at. They get to run and play in a doggy daycare sort of thing and I get to go to a spa and then we play together after. Dinner and a dog-themed movie then more games before bed.

367,dogs,"I have a 6-year-old german shepherd, unfortunately, my father (who is the dog's primary owner) is seemingly against socializing my dog with other dogs in a friendly manner because he doesn't want his dogs to be ""soft"". He wants our dogs to be guard dogs but obviously, they've been the aggressors. For instance, one time 3 years ago I was playing fetch and my dog suddenly sees the neighbor walking her golden retriever (he's an angel) and my dog switches focus from the ball and instantly just sprints 200 feet straight into this other dog's jugular, I sprinted over and tackled my dog, and cradled this shepherd all the way back to my home, apologizing to my neighbor the whole way. Bear in mind my dog LOVES people, hell if we had a home intruder he'd be more likely to play with them than attack them.  But his aggression towards other dogs is ridiculous, this has happened 3 times with him. I know its not a fear response because he easily could've ran from these dogs too. My assumption is its a dominance response because he also feels the need to pee on top of the same spots where these other dogs pee, in front of them if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how can I train this behavior out of him at this point? I'm in college so im only with him 4 months out of the year, and I don't own a muzzle so I think dog parks are out of the question. Is there any form of discipline that works on dogs exhibiting this behavior? I love my dog but this can't keep going on like this. We bring him to kennels with lots of running space for play and humane living spaces while we go on vacation, and even then he can only aggressively bark at other dogs, so I don't think its a guarding response, nor is it a fear response.

368,dogs,"Hi everyone

Our dog (1 year old GSD mix, rescue) has recently discovered her VERY LOUD bark. She‚Äôs easily stimulated by the environment, so she‚Äôs now started barking when she‚Äôs in the backyard.

Her bark is triggered by seeing birds up in the trees where she can‚Äôt get them, hearing people walking by our house, and of course other dogs barking.

Our backyard is fully fenced, the fence is not see through so it‚Äôs not usually visual stimulus that gets her going, it‚Äôll be hearing other people or dogs outside mostly.

My neighbour just let me know that it‚Äôs very loud and disruptive to her and the neighbours on her other side (she was very nice about it). I feel bad and we do need to address it, I‚Äôm planning to bring it up to our trainer but I wondered if anyone has some training tips or games we can play with her in the meantime to help? Anything you‚Äôve tried that has helped?

Other things to note:
- she gets lots of exercise and mental stimulation through walks, playing, and puzzles every day

- she virtually NEVER barks inside, not even when the doorbell rings. 

- currently when she barks we just try getting her to come inside. Of course, while I‚Äôm working she tends to get bored and wants to be outside more often, so bringing her in often leads to her wanting to go back out within 2 mins

377,dogs,"My dog has two very different sides. For most of the day she's happy to just lay around. She's good with all basic commands and getting better at recall from the backyard into the house. She waits at doors, waits for food. The problem is, the other side of her is just overly friendly, too much for her own good (or crazy, however you want to put it). I walk her daily for nearly an hour. Over time she's gotten better with pulling which used to be insane, she now mostly walks next to me after half a year of training. But a few problems still persist that are extremely frustrating: 

1. She now also stops eating random non edible things off the ground when I tell her. But if she finds something thats actually edible (not paper or plastic etc), she'll just ignore my command and gobble it down. When I try getting it out of her mouth she'll just clamp her jaws shut and flail around going crazy, or if I manage to get my hands in there, they're getting chewed. This is always worrying because we had a scare when she was a puppy where she ate something (unknown to this day) that led to a blockage and nearly required surgery. She almost died that day and I've always been on edge about something similar happening again. I always try to be hyper vigilant and two steps ahead of her but sometimes I miss something. Today she ate gum off the sidewalk. Sometimes its bread. Once I pulled a chocolate biscuit out. It's horrible. It happens so quick that it's hard to prevent or intervene. 
2. She will chase anything that moves - especially kids on bikes, skateboards, incoming cars (?!),  squirrels. She selectively either walks past people with no problem or will randomly try to jolt or jump at them without warning (also cars. Like wtf!) . Often times they get jump scared, which is totally valid from their point of view. They don't know that my dog is overly eager to meet them. The same goes for other dogs which she barks and lunges at from far, to the point I'm just dragging her along, but when they finally meet she's just very nice and friendly. Same thing where it happens so quick that I can't do much but pull her back. This is something I feel bad about because reactivity likely means I didn't do a good job socializing her as a young puppy. She's overly stimulated by people and dogs and doesn't see it as a normal occurrence despite us walking past them every single day, and occasionally stopping to meet them (which I've stopped doing to teach her that on walks we just walk past). I've tried giving treats the second she see's a dog and doesn't bark, but the closer we get the more useless it becomes. Recall while outside on leash is getting better but she still ignores a lot. I don't have any friends with dogs and we don't get many visitors at home - how would you guys handle socializing? Are dog parks the best bet? Thats something I can do more often, but how can I translate it into leash reactivity? 
3. The second you try to pet her, she thinks it's play time and she'll try to bite your hands. I've tried training her out of thinking this is a game ever since she was young but there's a lack of consistency with the rest of my family who don't enforce the same rules as I do, so she gets away with things when I'm not there and it reinforces bad behaviour. If I tell her to stop she listens but then steps back and barks like she's talking back after being told no. When she was only a few months old she would chomp and draw blood. Now its more like chewing wrists/forearms and playing with your fingers. I've always heard it was something they grow out of but she's older now, it's bad that you can't interact with her without her trying to bite.
4. This one I'm not sure if it's a problem or a quirk but when my dad comes home or people visit on occasion, she does this crying wailing bark that sounds like she's being tortured. Just highly emotional to the point everyones like wow is your dog okay. I'm pretty sure she doesn't have seperation anxiety because she's fine on her own and doesn't react the same way when myself or other family members enter the house. If it's just that she's the most attached to my dad that's annoying because he does the least dog work out of all of us lmao

The random eating and lunging/barking are the most difficult ones because it's suicidal. It drives me crazy and I couldn't trust her off leash because she will eat whatever she thinks is tasty and probably run in front of a car trying to investigate it.

379,dogs,"My boxer boy, Humphrey, is my first dog ever. Since my wife and I got him as a puppy, he has enriched our lives greatly. He's incredibly kind, loyal, loving, and impossibly goofy. However, we've had our fair share of challenges... including the occasional trips to the vet/emergency animal hospital for something he's managed to swallow (including a whole tennis ball...I'll get to that). We've been told by multiple vets that eating things they're not supposed to is a behavior that most dogs grow out of in adulthood, but Humphrey has had two incidents in the past 3 months that required vet intervention. We really try to closely monitor what he has access to, and have limited what kind of toys he's allowed to have. Has anyone dealt with similar behavioral issues successfully? If so, any advice?

\---

\- **Tennis ball**: When he was almost 2 years old, he started throwing up late at night all of a sudden,  several hours after his last meal. We took him to the vet and they told us to ""keep an eye on it"". It did not improve over the course of a few days so we took him back. They suggested that he might be having stomach acid issues, and that his stomach was getting irritated when it was empty. They recommended putting him on a gentle diet for a bit, told us to give him a small snack before bed and prescribed anti-acids. This did not improve the situation. However, he was not noticeably losing weight, he was able to eat and potty normally. After another couple of weeks, we scheduled an ultrasound. However, he suddenly got worse and wasn't keeping down food and seemed very lethargic, so we took him to the emergency vet. Upon xray, it was discovered that he had an ENTIRE TENNIS BALL in his stomach that he must have chewed to the point where it was flattened (we still have no clue how he possibly could have done it). We were shocked. It turned out that it must have been sitting in a position in his stomach where food was able to pass through, but it had shifted. Emergency surgery and 2.5 days in the hospital later he was home and made a full recovery. No more tennis balls/balls that aren't incredibly tough in our house anymore

\- **Rope toy**: Humphrey stayed with our neighbors while we were out for a day last year, and chewed up their dog's rope toy while they weren't paying attention. He ate no less than 6 inches of the .75 inch thick rope. We only discovered this when he started pooping out orange bits of rope. Luckily he had ripped off pieces rather than swallowing it whole and was able to pass it all.

\- **Cellophane wrapper**: This one was kind of my fault. Back in October, I had gotten a pastry from the local coffee shop and left the last little bit on the coffee table while I went to get a shower. It was wrapped up in about 1 foot of cling wrap. While I was in the shower, I heard him messing with the plate and immediately ran out of the shower to find the pastry and the cellophane gone and Humphrey standing there licking his lips. We immediately took him to the vet who induced vomiting and got it out.

\- **The Christmas squeaker toy:** Just a couple weeks ago on Christmas, we gave Humphrey a new toy. It was a stick shape made of really dense rubber with a squeaker in it that was marketed as being ""super durable"". 10 minutes after getting it, we realized he had already chewed off the plug on the end of it that contained the squeaker and we couldn't find it anywhere. So, back to the emergency vet for another puke session... on Christmas day.

\---

There have been a few other minor incidents that haven't required vet intervention luckily. We really really really try to be careful, and as I said, we've limited what things/types of toys he has access to, and try to monitor him closely.

388,dogs,"I have a two year old rescue (pseudonym- Alice) who is immensely loving towards both people and other dogs. When she was roughly 6 months old she met another young bitch (pseudonym- Mia) of the same age and, interestingly, incredibly similar markings and size. From the moment they met they became best friends and would play for hours on end until one or both became exhausted. It is now 1.5 years on and they remain just as closely- bonded; commonly being mistaken for sisters. 

In the last 3 weeks both Alice and Mia have spent a lot more time together than they usually have done in the past and I fear it may have given cause to some unwanted behaviour that we are now seeing from Mia. Individually they are both still very friendly with other dogs and will play with any breed of any age, however, Mia has now started to snap at other dogs that attempt to join them in playing ‚Äúrough and tumble‚Äù. 

To provide some context- Alice and Mia play very rough with each other, sometimes to the point where one will drag the other along the floor by the scruff of their neck. Mia is dominant however they have absolutely never fought-to-injure each other; the dominance simply becomes apparent when Mia resource-guards food/treats from Alice. The aggression arises when Alice is trying to play with Mia but another dog is running within 1-2 metres of them (trying to join the fun). Mia will then go to bite the foreign dog until she is pulled away. No harm has yet come to her or another dog however this is becoming more and more frequent. It happened twice today on the same walk. 

I‚Äôve had dogs my whole life and whilst I think I understand them better than the average joe, I don‚Äôt pretend to know their psychology confidently- some are just very unpredictable.

Well now we have a dog, a puppy, and that‚Äôs exactly what happens. She hears me, starts barking, barking wakes the baby. Total 5am shitshow. 

The only solution right now is to tiptoe around my own house in the dark and hope she doesn‚Äôt hear me. Which is ridiculous.

What can I do? She has a cover on her crate so it‚Äôll be dark. What needs to happen is she needs to learn that just because she hears something she stays calm. At 6am everyone‚Äôs up (school/baby/etc) but freaking out at 4-5am is awful. I don‚Äôt know how to teach her.

407,dogs,"Hi, I‚Äôm not an avid user but need advice.

I‚Äôm a late 20s male that looked for an active dog between local shelters and rescues to take outdoors with me and play around the house. I found a four year old Golden Pyrenees that required a home without children and have been fostering about a week. He‚Äôs received about two years of professional training following a bite incident in an overwhelming situation. 

I thought my lifestyle and lack of roommates would be a good fit for him but a few behaviors are telling me I should not go through with the adoption.

Firstly, he‚Äôs aggressive towards other dogs regardless of temperament. I‚Äôm big enough in stature and pay enough attention to mitigate any contact, but he‚Äôs acted pretty viciously toward a couple friendly dogs. 

Second, he has no distinction between household objects and toys and doesn‚Äôt respond to verbal corrections. I‚Äôm thinking this could improve in time as I continue to learn what he responds to and how he learns. 

Third and most concerning, he attempts to play with humans as dogs would play. He likes to use his big frame and paws to dominate seated or resting humans to which he begins to latch onto arms and hands. He doesn‚Äôt respond to verbal corrections and physically pushing him backward further excites him. The mouth latching doesn‚Äôt seem inherently aggressive but on two occasions it‚Äôs gotten to the point that I‚Äôve had to leave the room to get away. It‚Äôs especially worrisome if guests are over. I could keep him crated in these instances but he becomes very vocal if feeling ignored. 

I truly want to help this dog as he doesn‚Äôt have many other options but he‚Äôs already received a fair amount of training and seems like a safety risk.

Would you send him to daycare or hire someone to stop in for visit/potty break around lunchtime?

413,dogs," Hi there. I am coming to this sub looking for insight from the masses of like minded people.  
A bit about me. I am a 32 year old, heavily emotional person. I have a handful of mental issues including depression, anxiety (treated) and I am on the autism spectrum. Normally I post in hip hop subs, or boardgame subs, but I come to you today asking for advice. A bit of context for the year, In may my mother (the strongest most independent person I have ever known) Had a surprise anyurism, and on the way to the hospital, she had a stroke. She was in the ICU for months, and they said she would likely never be the same. She beat all of those odds, and is almost 100% herself again, and even back to working full time. She lives about 30 minutes from me, with our dog. I have a very very hard time dealing with death. People around me seem to be able to handle it in the manner of ""This is happening, let's deal with it and do our best"" but me, I have a hard time with that with any person, or pet. This time, it's my dog. She lives at my moms house, and she is getting tired, to say the least. She has been through so much in her long life, and she is an absolute trooper. She was not moving at all after a strong seizure about 5 months ago, and we took her at 4am to put her to sleep. As they put the needle in to have her drift off, she woke up and started walking around, acting totally normal. Needless to say, we chose not to do it that night, and she has been living a normal life at my moms house since. I went to see her last night, and she didn't get up. She puts her head up and stares at the phone when my mom plays a song I wrote about her, but otherwise, she is totally tired. As I left, she got up, ate, drank, and followed me around, and my mom called this morning to tell me that she was exploring the house and had a good breakfast and water like normal this morning. I don't think she is going anywhere right now, and I think and hope she is able to do so peacefully, when SHE is ready.  
My fear and anxiety of the impending loss is absolutely crippling. Everyone around me is handling it better. My wife is strong, and even though she loves my dog like she is her own, and lived with her for 10 years, she has a stronger handling of these things. My mom, even though she doesn't want to be alone, is prepared to accept the time our doggo decides on. My mom has been through a lot, obviously, and has lost so much as well, including my dad, some years ago.  
A lot of other people are just on the ""It's just a dog"" train. I am the type of person that hired a vet to do a video call with our goldfish because he had a bump. Pets are family.  
All of that said, I don't know how to handle day to day things right now, I am at work right now, and my boss may see this too, luckily I am super open with him so he likely won't be surprised.  
Even at home, with my happy, healthy family, I can't get through basic tasks without intrusive thoughts popping in and ruining what I am doing. Anything from watching a movie, reading a book, or playing a video game suddenly goes on autopilot as my mind drifts off and thinks about ""how much longer she has left"" I want to be able to enjoy my life, while also accepting the reality of the situation, and just being prepared for it. I am extremely envious of people that are able to do that, and I admire it. I know that was a lot, but if anyone has any insight, that would be amazing.

This is a story about how Lurch has helped me be a better dog owner overall.\n\nWe got my great dane Lurch a couple years back as a rescue; my first great dane.  My in-laws took him in, but didn\'t have anywhere to keep him long term, so we agreed to take him.  A photo of him taken a month before we got him showed that he was terribly emaciated when my in-laws picked him up.\n\nWhen we got him, Lurch was food aggressive, and he became ""very"" protective of us, me in particular.  He exhibited reactive behavior towards certain other people, other dogs, etc., but his food aggression was indiscriminate.  It almost seemed like he didn\'t have control over it because he was always immediately apologetic when it happened.  The second day we had him I fed him and when I tried to grab the bowl when he emptied it, he snapped at me, twice.  The first time it didn\'t really register what had happened because he didn\'t do it with any real force, and I\'d never had a dog snap at me like that before.  The 2nd time he did it a little harder and I realized what he was doing.  He still never broke the skin, but his intent became clear the second time. At this point he was only 7 months old, but already 90 pounds despite not being fed properly when he was younger.\n\nAll my life I\'d been around dogs that couldn\'t stand their ground even if they had wanted to, so I could just shoot from the hip and treat dogs the way I had always seen other people treat them when they misbehaved, and a lot of that was wrong, dead wrong.  As a kid I had never had an adult in my life who was a real expert on dog training show me how to do it, all I had ever seen was either people who were extremely passive and let their dogs get away with murder, or people who were overly abusive and beat their animals into submission.  I tended to have a natural affinity for them a lot of the time, but I had never bothered trying to actually educate myself because it didn\'t feel necessary.  I realized that I had a lot to learn about how to properly train a dog because when your dog is literally as big as you are (Lurch is actually taller than me when he stands up), and has the physical ability to seriously hurt you if they wanted to, you\'re forced to take a step back and I realized that a lot of a dog\'s reactions are not just a result of what and how you teach them, but it stems from your own energy, your own self confidence around the dog, and the self confidence (or lack thereof) of other humans around them.  They feed off your energy.  That\'s not to say that I\'m scared of Lurch, I\'m absolutely not and I could physically restrain him if I had to, and have on an occasion or two around other dogs he didn\'t like, but that would be traumatic for the dog and I would most definitely come out with a few marks.\n\nThe love and affection Lurch showed me was enough to convince me that him acting out was not some kind of mean spirited aggression, a desire to hurt anybody, but it was some kind of fear that resulted from formative events that happened when he was a puppy, whether that\'s other dogs bullying him and taking his food or whatever.  Some of it could also have stemmed from my own nervous energy, since he latched onto me, and maybe felt the need to protect me. It was love at first sight when we got him, and I was willing to put in the work to learn how to be the confident leader he needed, the one that I hadn\'t always been for dogs we\'ve had in the past.\n\nIt\'s hard to admit, but I wasn\'t the best dog owner before we got him, and I still have a lot to learn, but getting him has made me a better dog owner because I realized real quick that physically fighting with a 150+ pound dog was not an option.  If he ""really"" doesn\'t want to physically do something, you\'re not going to force him.  You can\'t just pick him up and tuck him under one arm and put him in the bedroom if he gets aggressive when guests come over.  You have to be able to exude confidence and create a trusting environment where you can speak to your dog like a person, where they remain calm and trust you to make the right decision.  A while back my son (autistic, 11yo) scared the life out of me because he was eating a sandwich in the living room, and Lurch reached over and took the sandwich.  Before I could stop him, my son reached and took it out of the dog\'s mouth, scolded him and said, ""Bad dog, now it\'s nasty"" and threw it in the trash, and Lurch never uttered a sound or did anything, he just kind of huffed and walked away.  That\'s what being a calm, confident leader can do; it can take a dog that snaps at you over an empty bowl to a dog that lets your autistic child take food out of its mouth. I don\'t make a habit of bothering his food though. When I give him food in his bowl, he recognizes the difference between that and our food, so even though he can lay his head in my lap while I eat over top of him without issue, and even though he\'s MUCH better even around his own bowl, I still afford him space just out of respect for his personal space.\n\nAs much as I love this dog as both a companion and a protector of the family, probably more than any dog I\'ve ever owned before, I\'ll be forever grateful for the fact that he forced me to recognize flaws within myself and become a better dog owner overall.\n\nAnother thing I\'ve noticed though, since getting him, is that people who own small dogs tend to let their dogs get away with a LOT that absolutely would not fly if Lurch were to do it.  We were walking in the park once and some lady\'s little off leash chihuahua took off after us yapping its little head off.  Lurch never made a sound, he just looked at it, kinda confused, but I put myself in front of him and made him sit to keep him in a calm state of mind until the lady came and picked up her little rat dog, and then we continued our walk.  If Lurch had been the one acting that way, the cops could have been called.\n\nLurch has taught me a hell of a lot, and I think from now on, personally, I\'m going to stick with great danes because of him.', 'author_fullname': 't2_14b2ug', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'My reactive great dane has made me a better person', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/reactivedogs', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_10780m0', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.87, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 6, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Success', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 6, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1673249176.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.reactivedogs', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share this story because I thought you all might like it.  This is a story about how Lurch has helped me be a better dog owner overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got my great dane Lurch a couple years back as a rescue; my first great dane.  My in-laws took him in, but didn&amp;#39;t have anywhere to keep him long term, so we agreed to take him.  A photo of him taken a month before we got him showed that he was terribly emaciated when my in-laws picked him up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we got him, Lurch was food aggressive, and he became &amp;quot;very&amp;quot; protective of us, me in particular.  He exhibited reactive behavior towards certain other people, other dogs, etc., but his food aggression was indiscriminate.  It almost seemed like he didn&amp;#39;t have control over it because he was always immediately apologetic when it happened.  The second day we had him I fed him and when I tried to grab the bowl when he emptied it, he snapped at me, twice.  The first time it didn&amp;#39;t really register what had happened because he didn&amp;#39;t do it with any real force, and I&amp;#39;d never had a dog snap at me like that before.  The 2nd time he did it a little harder and I realized what he was doing.  He still never broke the skin, but his intent became clear the second time. At this point he was only 7 months old, but already 90 pounds despite not being fed properly when he was younger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All my life I&amp;#39;d been around dogs that couldn&amp;#39;t stand their ground even if they had wanted to, so I could just shoot from the hip and treat dogs the way I had always seen other people treat them when they misbehaved, and a lot of that was wrong, dead wrong.  As a kid I had never had an adult in my life who was a real expert on dog training show me how to do it, all I had ever seen was either people who were extremely passive and let their dogs get away with murder, or people who were overly abusive and beat their animals into submission.  I tended to have a natural affinity for them a lot of the time, but I had never bothered trying to actually educate myself because it didn&amp;#39;t feel necessary.  I realized that I had a lot to learn about how to properly train a dog because when your dog is literally as big as you are (Lurch is actually taller than me when he stands up), and has the physical ability to seriously hurt you if they wanted to, you&amp;#39;re forced to take a step back and I realized that a lot of a dog&amp;#39;s reactions are not just a result of what and how you teach them, but it stems from your own energy, your own self confidence around the dog, and the self confidence (or lack thereof) of other humans around them.  They feed off your energy.  That&amp;#39;s not to say that I&amp;#39;m scared of Lurch, I&amp;#39;m absolutely not and I could physically restrain him if I had to, and have on an occasion or two around other dogs he didn&amp;#39;t like, but that would be traumatic for the dog and I would most definitely come out with a few marks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The love and affection Lurch showed me was enough to convince me that him acting out was not some kind of mean spirited aggression, a desire to hurt anybody, but it was some kind of fear that resulted from formative events that happened when he was a puppy, whether that&amp;#39;s other dogs bullying him and taking his food or whatever.

418,dogs,"My 9 year old dog has for the last few years needed to go potty in the middle of the night. That's fine. He always wakes me up and it's never been more than twice a night.

Here in the last 6 months or so... It's gotten much worse. Just last night, he woke me up every hour and a half. 2 of the times, he had to do #1 and #2 but the rest of the time, it was just #1.

He sleeps a LOT. He's a 100lb American bull terrier. He gets energy at around dinner time because he smells food cooking and wants to beg lol. Once we put food away, he finally gives up and goes back to sleep.

He drinks a lot when he does get up. Even in the middle of the night. I can't quite measure how much because we do have other pets that drink from the same bowl... But I can say that stands there the longest out of anyone. Every time he wakes me up, we walk out of the bedroom and he goes straight to the water bowl for what feels like an eternity while he drinks and THEN he's ready to go outside to potty. It could feel like it's taking forever to me because I'm half asleep and just trying to hurry up to get back to bed ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but other people in the house have commented about how long he stands there drinking. Maybe he's not getting enough in his mouth at one time and he takes longer? I don't know. I've been worried that if I pull up his water, he'll be too thirsty. 

I pull his food up at 8pm but not water I already feel badly about doing that because he doesn't seem to get up and eat until around 3 or 4 in the afternoon anyway. I thought it would be mean to take his water though. I'd hate if I couldn't drink when I was thirsty, but maybe I'm looking at things the wrong way. Is it mean to restrict his water?

419,dogs,"Hello,

maybe someone remembers my thread from two years ago called ""Breeders of this very sub, how do you feel about clients who visit other breeders?"", where I mention a misunderstanding in the post. Namely that the breeder I'm in contact with for years thought that I didn't want one this year.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/m4wnhq/discussion\_breeders\_of\_this\_very\_sub\_how\_do\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/m4wnhq/discussion_breeders_of_this_very_sub_how_do_you/)

So this thread is sort of an update. I still wish to purchase a Keeshond, and as you can see from the ""Vent""-flair, it didn't turn out well.

Last year, my father by chance met my breeder at a Covid-test center, was asked if he was indeed my father, and upon confirmation, was informed that the next litter would arrive at the end of autumn. Figuring that it will be another two months, I have waited until this January to inquire again and mention their meeting.

It was... quite an unpleasant surprise upon reading his answer that he is hesitant to sell one to my household after my father allegedly asked ""when are the mutts ready?"". I was shocked, assured the breeder that he didn't mean it derogatory, that I was still there to take care of the dog, and asked for a second chance. Spoiler: He just said ""no"". And that's it. I'm starting from absolute zero again.

Upon asking my father about it, however, he insisted with sincere confusion that he had never asked when the next litter was, and that he had never said mutts, as he doesn't know the word. He has even asked me what it meant. He's not a native speaker and his grasp of the language is lacking to say the least, so I believe him.

Sure, I could simply go to another breeder. The problem is though, that the Keeshond is very rare in my country, and the breeder is closely connected to others. So connected, that he knew immediately that I was looking elsewhere after asking another breeder. And now that he refuses to sell to me and has it in his head that my household may be abusive, I'm afraid that he will just send a warning to everyone else to blacklist me.

I'm absolutely livid, devastated, and confused at the same time. All those years spent saving up money, reading, researching, hoping, and waiting, only to get a ""lol fuck you"" at the end? 

On one hand, I want to yell at him, calling him out on stringing me along for two years, making up excuses, and lying - and on the other hand, I know that it's probably pointless and will only make things worse.

All I want is to give a good life to a Keeshond.

421,dogs,"I really want to make sure we do the right thing here, for us and for our dogs. This has been an emotionally strenuous situation.

We have 2 border collies who have been the most amazing dogs we could've ever asked for.

When we got these dogs we had a yard, space to play fetch with them outside, and went on lots of hikes / trail runs with them.

A few years ago, we had to move to a large, densely populated city for work and brought our dogs with us. Because of the location, we were unfortunately unable to have a yard, so we took them on walks 1-2 times a day and went running with them a few times a month, but unfortunately it was nothing like before.

As such, they started to get more and more agitated, and rightfully so. They went from playing fetch and going hiking, to walks in our neighborhood at best. There were even a few times when they got in a fight at home, it was extremely stressful for my partner and I.

That being said, we decided to do what was best for our dogs (hey, we chose to adopt them right?) and I quit my job and we moved to a more rural area where we bout an acre of land and plenty of room for them to roam around like they should.

The problem though is that my partner and I are really not happy. We love our dogs and we love each other, but where we felt most fulfilled in life was in the city. Every day we find ourselves longing to move back.

**We're now stuck with the following dilemma**: should we re-home our dogs and move back to the city that we love, or should we stick it out here with them here knowing they'll have a better life?

I have no doubt that we'll be able to find them good homes through our network. We have plenty of connections that could help us spread the word and are we are willing to put in the work to ensure the home is a good fit for them.

This is one of the toughest decisions we've ever had to make.

422,dogs,"I live in a household of 4 members, with my parents and my younger brother. Recently we discussed about having a dog, and of course taking care of it the way it should be. We also already had some experience with 2 dogs in the past, a German shepherd and a Siberian husky.

We live in a house which is all ours, and we also have a pretty large backyard where your future dog would stay to play with us, or just spending his/her time whenever he/she wants. Furthermore, having the possibility of free time to manage, I also like go out for a walk a lot, spending time with family, friends, meeting new people, visiting places and other stuff like that. So it would also be great to take our dog out with us venturing in new places or just going around. Same thing can be for him/her meeting other dogs and playing with them.

We have intention of having a large sized dog as our preference, and thankfully this is possible because we have a lot of space in our house, not to mention the backyard. As an extra, it could be useful if we can train our dog to guard our house, not needed, but might be useful on some aspects.

But most of all, the reason why my family and I want a dog is for the fact that interacting with it can have a lot of benefits for us, including developing a trust relationship with someone as a companion, doing different things to make our daily routine more enjoyable, meeting new people (even just by meeting their dogs so we can introduce ourself to their owners and start a friendship), or even just fighting stress that we can get from a busy day.

In my relatively limited knowledge as a dog lover (I'm not a dog trainer, K-9 unit police officer or any other expert about different dog breeds), I know that German shepherds, Labradors and Goldens are particularly recommended. But I don't know if there are other breeds besides the 3 mentioned that could fit this criteria.

425,dogs,"Over the holiday weekend my 3 year old dog developed a swollen and red toe. His back paw, 2nd digit. Next day it got worse, went to the ER since Vet was closed. ER said infection, gave me meds and sent me home. They gave my dog a cone and said to go to my Vet in about a week for a follow up. 

Next day my dogs toe was 100x worse. Back to the ER to which we realized he was able to get through the cone and was most likely licking all night and made a really bad issue worse. They said keep it dry, one little lick will cause major delay in healing and basically gave us all the cones, none worked and some were just too big. They said to try a sock, works 50% of the time and that was that. 

After about 2 days of watching him 24/7 (yes I stayed up and watched him) we went to my general vet for a check up since I was overly worried figured seeing his Dr a little early couldn't hurt. 

His vet switched his meds, and told me a few licks isn't the end of the world and to soak in epsom salt. He wanted to see him in 2 days. We followed suit, obviously didn't let the dog lick. Someone is always watching him. But his toe continued to be swollen, bloodly, and very scaby.  Scabs were falling off, toe was bleeding, we cleaned it and did absolutely everything we could. 

2 days later, the vey didn't think the toe was improving, (side note, by this time my dog was finally walking on it totally fine, previously had a limp). Vet told me we had to biopsy and to do that was to remove the digit, which seemed very aggressive as a plan. I asked for a needle aspera, which the vet didn't even suggest. The vet did it, but told me it was a waste that and it wouldn't be enough sample. Vet did it, got a bunch of samples and told me in a week to come back to amputate. 

On my way home from that visit I broke down. How was this happening, I know losing a digit isn't a big deal, but are we not trying other means of recovery first? It was only about 5 days from first notice to wanting to amputate. Vet immediately suggested cancer and toe needs to come off. 

After about 2 days, we got the report and no signs of cancer. Lab shows signs of bacteria inflammation and possible begin tumor, but suggest further biposy. Possible histicytoma. (sp?) which is seen in young dogs and can go away on their own and are begin. Mind you, his toe is swollen, no sign of a single bump or lesion.  Vet still suggest losing the toe to be safe? I have a 3rd follow up in a few days to discuss. However, after talking to the Dr about his report he thinks its best to just lose the toe and not worry about anything. Which still seems very severe to me. 

Currently, a week later my dog is improving. Infection looks totally gone, still some swelling, but improvement is major. Still on antibiotics for 5 more days, and he hasn't licked in about 5 days.  I haven't slept in 7 but thats besides the point. We have a medical boot for walks to keep it dry and clean, and i use an antibiotic ointment a few times a day as well as an anti fungal spray the ER gave me. I am not soaking his foot as the ER told me my Vets advice was wrong and keeping it dry would be best practice. That seems to work better for us and improvement. 

We have a 2nd opinion for early this week so curious to see what they say. 

Based on this history summery, would you amputate? Just curious to get other pet owners opinion. A few friends in Vet school said amputation while not a big deal in dogs, is still a surgery with complication why not see if my dog heals first?

At the end of the day, whatever is best for my dog is best, 100% I will never deny that.

426,dogs,"So my friend and I were having a conversation about the health problems of various breeds we are interested in. She is in the market for a new dog after her lazy and cuddly 30 pound beagle mix. She is looking for a purebred dog that is similar but slightly different: small to medium, low to moderate activity level, short coat (no non-shedding), healthy and long lived, not brachy, and not terrier. She didn't want a purebred beagle, which narrowed things down to CKCS and American Cocker. She was leaning toward American Cocker, as she reasoned that heart problems and neurological problems are worse than possible ear and skin issues. However, she was surprised that there are a decent amount of people with the opposite opinion: they would rather deal with those issues than ear and skin issues.

Because I've encountered similar situations in breeds I'm looking into. The breeds that I like and fit my lifestyle the best either have a notable chance of deafness or are prone to skin issues. And I'm coming up with similar responses. There are people who would rather have a deaf dog than one with skin issues.

446,dogs,"Hey all üëã I am a pet sitter on rover but I have ample experience due to the fact that growing up my parents owned a pet care company. Furthermore, today a client dropped off his dog and immediately I noticed he was drinking ample amounts of water and then needing to pee every hour or two afterwards. Since I have experience I immediately recognized that this could be a sign of many potential things wrong with the dog. So I texted his owner right away, telling him what was happening, that I was concerned about it, and why. He told me that his dog does this, so he only gives him water at meal times as well as 1/4 of a bowl per day. I have never heard of this before, I have always found it very important to make sure dogs in my care have access to clean fresh water at all times. However this is not my dog so if it is what the owner does than so be it. Now this dog is three maybe almost four the owner has had him since he was around 9 months old. So I suppose this has been going on the dogs entire life? To make a long question long my final inquiry would be to ask do you guys think there is something wrong with the dog, or do you think the dog is drinking so much water because he is used to it being withheld therefore when made available all the time he feels the need to drink as much as possible. I know this doesn‚Äôt make much sense since then the problem wouldn‚Äôt have existed in the first place, but maybe it was far more mild initially as opposed to now since water has been being withheld for so many years?

450,dogs,"Our childhood American Eskimo is 15, and we made an appointment to say goodbye to her next week. But I‚Äôm getting some cold feet now as she seems to be doing better the past few days! And I‚Äôve been doing a lot of online QOL calculators with mixed results. Sometimes they say it‚Äôs definitely the end; other times we‚Äôre in a gray area.  I think we‚Äôre right in the gray but would appreciate an outside perspective about whether to cancel the appointment‚Ä¶ 

The good:
- no issues breathing
- no ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù ailment (such as cancer); no seizures or anything
- enjoys her treats (but we‚Äôre limited to only giving her fruits as treats due to pancreatitis attacks) 
- takes gabapantin regularly which seems to manage pain a bit
- when the doggy door is open, she knows to go outside to urinate and knows generally whether she‚Äôs inside or outside 

The sad:
- blind for the past 2 years
- no longer enjoys walks (one of her favorite things in the past) and usually wants to turn back home after 5 min or so
- no longer wants to be pet by us and seems to try to escape us when we talk (she goes outside). The not petting is a big change in behavior 
- eats her food but only with mix in fresh chicken
- has arthritis and pancreatitis. The arthritis means her gait is off (and her foot in the back kind of limps/lags) and she pants in pain; the pancreatitis means we can‚Äôt even feed her her favorite foods without risking her severe pain. 
- difficulty sitting down; pants heavily when doing so like it‚Äôs an exertion 
- sleeps most of day
- for 2-3 days last week, she could not get up on her own on tile flooring. She ended up slipping in her own urine twice. It was devastating to see and that‚Äôs what inspired the appointment. She was terrified. But since then, she has been better after we put in rugs to help her grip. 
- she pees a lot more frequently than before‚Äîso much that we thought it was a UTI at first 
- she seems often disoriented and confused. She circles and pace often when she‚Äôs not asleep 
- we have seen a single instance of tail wagging (to greet a friend for 3 seconds) in the past 2 months

I know we could keep her alive for a while. But the SHOULD is harder.  What do you do when there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù (beyond arthritis) but most of the joys are unavailable?  Anyone else struggle with this decision?

452,dogs,"Hey everyone! I was hoping to get some advice/opinions on something.
I've been looking to adopt a dog for quite some time now and have recently found a lovely dog that I'm interested in adopting. He is a 11mo old Pitbull Mastiff cross, that is extremely sweet and loving. He grew up in a home with an older small dog and a small toddler and his current owners said that he's literally never shown any kind of aggression at all before.
The only thing that I am worried about is that I have two cats at home. Pretty well behaved but they do get zoomies and run around every day.
This pup hasn't ever been around cats at all. He does extremely well with the toddler he's grown up with and the small old dog.. What do you all think about this situation?
I get to go and meet him in two days here (potentially tomorrow evening) but I wanted to garner some advice on this.
I know that pitbulls often get a bad rep but I genuinely think it is 100 % about their upbringing.
The current owner has told me that in situations with other dogs, he actually tends to be quite submissive and uas never shown any signs of aggression, so I'm quite on the fence.

This is going to be garbled. This is probably going to blur the line between what's allowed, whatever.

Like a month ago my dog gets hurt by the neighbors dog. I sold my truck to cover the vet bills because what fucking dad is going to let his kids dog die before Christmas. She's made a mostly full recovery, I put up some cheap fencing to stop it from happening again.

Yesterday after I get home I let her out in the back yard, go and spend some time with my daughter and wife, talk about whatever shit we thought was important, then went to take a shower. I'm like half way through this shower when my wife comes in crying, not making any sense. She's 21 weeks pregnant, so I fear something happened with the kids so I get out of the shower. I make out enough that something is wrong with sugar, her/our daughters dog. I thought my neighbors dog was back so I tossed on my boxers and went outside with my rifle. I wish it had been the fucking rottweiler.

Some fucking stupid teens were taking pot shots at my dog with pellet guns on the out side of the fence, and they had got her leg so she was crawling away. I drew my rifle and the biggest one yelled to run and they took off. I didn't want to go to prison so I didn't pull the trigger.

Anyways, wife is calling her mom to give us a ride while I grabbed the dog and wrapped her up, got dressed and then we went to the vet. Vet says there is 20 pellets in her, and we're discussing putting her down because it's 2 grand to patch her up. He's keeping her for the weekend and not charging me for keeping her, he pulled me aside and told me straight up that sometimes they don't make it, and he would make sure she had a comfortable time and we could discuss things again Monday. If she passed away I didn't owe him anything, even though he would keep her sedated and pain free.

It's just...what the actual fuck is so God damned wrong with someone to get off on this shit. What in fuck broke their god damned minds that made them think this was acceptable? I can't fucking figure it out.

Anyways, thank you if you read this. I could really use some good vibes because this last month has sucked.

Edit: I did file a police report the next morning. Didn't want to get myself in trouble with a hot head.

457,dogs,"(TLDR at bottom)

Hi everyone,

I say ‚Äúmy‚Äù dog, but it‚Äôs really (one of) my childhood dogs, and moreso my mom‚Äôs now that I‚Äôve moved off for college (although I do visit at least a Friday-Monday each month). So I‚Äôm obviously still very close with him, and my (single, no other kids) mom is obviously extremely extremely close with him.

He‚Äôs a long haired chihuahua, and was the runt of his litter. He‚Äôs about 10.5 years, which is a little on the younger side for such issues he‚Äôs having. He‚Äôs always had an occasional/once a week-ish ‚Äúhonk‚Äù that the vet said was fine for now. About a year ago, the honk progressed to a full on cough fit/rattle that happened at least once a day, but it was usually brief. Again, the vet said it was fluid on his heart, but he should be fine for years.

Well, over the last six months (and especially 3 months), it has become a literal 24/7 deep chest cough. Anytime he‚Äôs moving, he is hacking, and he gets deep cough fits where he can‚Äôt move for minutes at a time several times a day. The only time he doesn‚Äôt is when he‚Äôs sleeping, but even then he wakes up several times during the night to hack, or laying completely still he sometimes won‚Äôt, but you can hear and see very very labored breathing.

The vet said he needed a medicine daily and would help it and that he wasn‚Äôt in pain, but I don‚Äôt see how he could be in a too good quality of life. Anyways, my mom tried the medicine for 3 weeks straight, and there was zero improvement. The side effect also made him pee 2x as much, several times in the house and in the bed. 

I can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôs having too good of a quality of life, and also, ‚Äúselfishly‚Äù‚Ä¶it‚Äôs very hard for my mom. She‚Äôs single, on the older side, and often works from 10 am to 7 pm, and getting him to take the pills took 10+ minutes bc he refused, no matter how it was hidden. His coughing at night keeps her up. The constant pee in the house and bed added even more work for her to do on her own. 

On the other hand, he *does* seem to be happy. He eats fine and plenty, he will run to the door and run in circles when we arrive, he‚Äôll get excited and wag his tail when we call his name. He just does all of that with an extreme cough and labored breathing that‚Äôs getting worse. 

My mom (and I, to give her advice), just don‚Äôt know what to do. We don‚Äôt want to extend his life just for him to be around and then he suddenly die of a painful heart attack, but we also don‚Äôt know since he appears otherwise happy if it‚Äôs wrong to put him down now when he could have another year at a decent level like this and then put him down when it got really bad.

TLDR: should a 10 year old dog with slow heart failure that is hacking/coughing 24/7 with labored breathing, but is otherwise happy, eats fine, etc, be put down?

461,dogs,"Hello! I have a 1.5 year old golden retriever boy, this is our second golden (we have a 3 year old girl). Our girl is near perfect, barks when needed, quiet otherwise. Our boy, on the other hand, has learned (probably through inadvertent positive reinforcement) that barking gets our attention. He demand barks all day every day, and demands constant attention. 

He ONLY barks when he wants us to play with him, when he wants to go outside, etc. But it's constant. We walk him twice a day, play with him, he has his sister to play with... he gets enough energy burn throughout the day. After a long day of walks and play, when we sit on the couch to chill at night... he barks. Constantly. Loudly. 

We've tried straight up ignoring him for months now. I've read all the measures to take and tried them. He knows place, I'll place him when he barks, make him stay in place for 5-10 minutes, leave the room, place him in his crate, on and on... but it's always back to barking. 

Am I simply to keep ignoring him until he finally gets it? There has been no improvement. 

Are bark e-collars simply a no-go? I see all the horror stories of causing further damage, other noises causing a false correction, etc. That being said, it seems like there are some legit collars like Sportdog NoBark SBCR. Seems like tech these days really limit/eliminate false corrections. I have convinced myself in practice and in theory that e-collars for training are great, but I can see why e-collars that automatically static for bark might be problematic and potentially inhumane. 

Again, he's not a reactive dog. He doesn't bark at other dogs, doesn't bark when the doorbell rings, he only demand barks for attention. But he demands attention all the time. 

So my question is: with new technology and the constant stream of ""this is terrible"" vs. ""the bark collar stigma is antiquated"" contradictions on Google... I just need to hear if anyone has had an overall very positive experience with a high quality bark collar. 

Another note is that I have properly e-collar trained him (unrelated to barking). Please save the ""e-collars are inhumane"", because I have read enough and trained enough to know they are not. He gets excited when I pull out the e-collar because he knows we're going to do fun stuff off leash in the neighborhood. He's basically fully off-leash trained with full recall via e-collar tone, and understands that e-collar static is a correction similar to a leash correction. I'm worried using bark e-collar correction for barking will ruin that progress, and curious if anyone else has used an e-collar for off leash work while also using an e-collar for bark correction.

464,dogs,"https://youtube.com/@defendersofhumansandthenat7378

They have a heaping load of videos about dogs. And about cats. One that caught my eye was this one. 

https://youtu.be/f-QzeCLPWh4

The takeaway from this video is that dogs simply are not capable of love - they are only able to identify us as sources of food. 

I want to use this post as a discussion for this as it‚Äôs making me question if my chihuahua truly loves me. The fact she begs to sleep on my bed, runs to me and asks to be picked up and lay in my lap, cries when she is split away from me - it‚Äôs difficult for my human brain to not interpret that as love, or at the very least, affection. In what situation could this be considered manipulation in order to extract food from me? I try my best to not let her be near toddlers or small humans, because I realize the unpredictableness of such situations. She is aggressive and territorial, and it‚Äôs a liability if she attacks a small human, even if such injury is minor. It would be my fault and I understand the situation well. 

However; this persons videos has been making me question it all. It‚Äôs such a unique point of view. What drew me in was her anti pitbull videos- due to my own personal experience I agreed with their points on that topic (I had a chihuahua mauled by a pitbull.) but doing a deep dive showed me a genre of anti pet ownership.

470,dogs,"Hey, so I will be getting a German Shepherd puppy in less then a week. He will be 8 weeks old. When the pup is ready (has all vaccines) I would like to find a way to walk both the pup and my 10 year old, well behaved Coonhound (She weighs 75lbs and is as healthy as a horse, just got her blood drawn last week and had all joints x-rayed several months ago - vet said she looked great, absolutely no problems) at the same time.

For the people who walked multiple dogs at once, what leads/tools and even collars or harnesses do you use?

Please be as specific as possible and stating what breeds and their ages would help me too.

I have a hoarder's collection of leads - from 8 feet 'police style' leads (you know the ones that have snaps at each end and several D rings through out) to leads you can wear around your waist, tons of 'regular' leads ranging from 2 feet to 12 feet (and everything in between), tons of 6 inch tab leads, and many leash extensions that you can add to any ole lead.


I also have several two dog lead couplers. The one I think I will get the most out of is a Sporn two dog coupler that gives about 3 feet for each dog, but it is also adjustable which will come in handy since obviously my Coonhound is going to be much taller then my puppy.

My favorite type of collar to use on my Coonhound is a martingale. What type of collar should I use for the puppy?

Does anyone here use 2 dog lead couplers? 

*Also I feel like I need to specify that of course the pup will be getting tons of one-on-one lead training\heeling training. And my coonhound will also get her solo walks too. :)

I started with wet cold towels to her ears and paws as well as turning on a fan towards her. My apartment AC does not function as well and won‚Äôt cool it down below 70 degrees. I have opened up windows since it is colder outside. 

I am so confused why she is spiking fever this high. Any recommendations? Did anyone experience persisting fever for their dogs after AHDS/HGE? How long will it take her to be normal? I am planning on taking her to the vet first thing Monday morning. 

Of note, she has history of colitis in the past. She had a dental surgery and lipoma removal a month ago and has been taking carprofen 100mg daily for about a week or so before the symptoms started due to possible CCL tear.",t2_4frhdwns,0,High fever despite improving symptoms of AHDS/HGE,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,1073j6a,True,Weak_Understanding53,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1073j6a/high_fever_despite_improving_symptoms_of_ahdshge/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1073j6a/high_fever_despite_improving_symptoms_of_ahdshge/,2480383,1673235461,0,,False,1673235473,1673235474,2023-01-09 03:37:41,,,,,

I have four dogs of various breeds and ages, all of which I got when they were puppies. The three older dogs are, for the most part, well-behaved. The youngest is an 8-month-old German Shepherd and one that I am still training. The fight broke out between the German Shepherd and my two-year-old Shih Tzu Mix.

It happened today, 5 minutes ago; as I type this, both dogs have been separated and crated away for their safety. I am not sure why it happened since I wasn‚Äôt all there when it happened, but I am glad I was there on time before anything worse happened. I don‚Äôt want anything like this to happen ever again.

480,dogs,"Hello!  I've been reading on here the past few days and am hoping some may have suggestions and experience.  Out Pekingese mix rescue has had itchiness/paw licking issues since we adopted her 2.5 years ago.  It gets worse at times and a few times has led to ear infections with her digging her ears raw.  She also has anal gland problems.  We've tried a variety of novel protein diets, Zyrtec, Cytopoint (made her not want to eat at all), medicated baths and foams, etc.  Recently the itch got a lot worse, so I asked the vet for other options to try, as I feel she is just miserable.  Vet said we can try apoquel, or a hydrolized diet plan.  I opted for the diet in hopes we can narrow down what the issue is instead of just treating symptoms.  I started the slow switchover of food last Thursday and so far she seems to like the Royal Canine HP dry and I tried making treats with the wet (both frozen and baked) and she is eating those as well.  Vet said she should also not use her toothpaste, chew her flavored Nylabones (we have peanut butter and bacon), or have her human veggie snacks that she loves (colored bell peppers, cucumbers, and baby carrots).  I guess I'll see if she will let me brush her teeth w/out the toothpaste.  Any ideas on what to replace the Nylabones with?  We went to PetSmart tonight and I picked up a Kong bone that will hold treats (she only chewed on it to get the treats out), and a Petstages Super Dogwood, which she started chewing on right away but after 10 minutes she had already started to shred the one end so I got nervous that maybe it wasn't as hardy as I hoped (for reference it takes her days to put a dent in a Nylabone and she uses one for several months before the one end gets so pointy I replace it).  Are these safe in general, and safe during the elimination diet trial?  Thanks for the ideas.

Like a month ago my dog gets hurt by the neighbors dog. I sold my truck to cover the vet bills because what fucking dad is going to let his kids dog die before Christmas. She's made a mostly full recovery, I put up some cheap fencing to stop it from happening again.

Yesterday after I get home I let her out in the back yard, go and spend some time with my daughter and wife, talk about whatever shit we thought was important, then went to take a shower. I'm like half way through this shower when my wife comes in crying, not making any sense. She's 21 weeks pregnant, so I fear something happened with the kids so I get out of the shower. I make out enough that something is wrong with sugar, her/our daughters dog. I thought my neighbors dog was back so I tossed on my boxers and went outside with my rifle. I wish it had been the fucking rottweiler.

Some fucking stupid teens were taking pot shots at my dog with pellet guns on the out side of the fence, and they had got her leg so she was crawling away. I drew my rifle and the biggest one yelled to run and they took off. I didn't want to go to prison so I didn't pull the trigger.

Anyways, wife is calling her mom to give us a ride while I grabbed the dog and wrapped her up, got dressed and then we went to the vet. Vet says there is 20 pellets in her, and we're discussing putting her down because it's 2 grand to patch her up. He's keeping her for the weekend and not charging me for keeping her, he pulled me aside and told me straight up that sometimes they don't make it, and he would make sure she had a comfortable time and we could discuss things again Monday. If she passed away I didn't owe him anything, even though he would keep her sedated and pain free.

It's just...what the actual fuck is so God damned wrong with someone to get off on this shit. What in fuck broke their god damned minds that made them think this was acceptable? I can't fucking figure it out.

TLDR: 16yo border collie mix (we think) is suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs (Canine Cognitive Disfunction) and has suddenly developed an irrational fear of my 10yo son who she has lived with and loved her entire life. What can I do to make things easier for everyone? 

My Sadie girl is 16, a border collie mix (we think) and is in her last few months of life. Over the last few years we have been mostly successful managing her Alzheimer‚Äôs as well as her cancer and arthritis. We are fairly certain that she was abused before she came to live with us. She‚Äôs always shown signs (leash reactivity, fear of new people, fear of men‚Ä¶etc) and we‚Äôve carefully managed her behaviour to keep everyone safe. But it‚Äôs always been clear that when she was aggressive it was due to fear. I‚Äôm not excusing aggression, just explaining her behaviour a little. 

She has loved kids since she was a puppy and has always been a bit of a nanny to my son (technically step-son but I love him as if he were my own). He used to say that she was like his second mom because she always protected him and loved on him so much. He adores her, he is always, and has always been gentle and loving to her. She has lived with him for his whole life. 

But, he is 10. And a boy. He‚Äôs busy, loud and happy. She doesn‚Äôt seem to understand the differences in loud noises anymore. If we‚Äôre loud, she gets scared. Doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre laughing or making other loud happy noises, she gets terrified of any raised voices. 

We have our little dude with us every other weekend. Sadie permanently moved in with us about 6 years ago. Now, suddenly, she has become afraid of him. As soon as he comes home she wants out of the house and hides in the yard for as long as we will allow her to.

489,dogs,"We have two dogs, a 10 (almost 11) year old lab and a 7 year old spaniel. They have both slept in open crates in the kitchen since they were puppies and there has rarely been a problem.

As he's gotten older, the lab has protested going into the kitchen at night, and instead of taking himself off when we tell him it's time for bed, often needs a good nudge in the right direction. We assumed he was just getting stubborn and trying his luck, but it started to get much worse where he would need dragging off the sofa and he'd sometimes dart for the stairs.

Usually he is fine once he's in his crate, but his behaviour has been really erratic recently. He has always been a nervous-ish dog. He hates fireworks, fox sounds, and gets spooked by any loud noise. If he gets spooked he scratches at the kitchen door and whine. On those occasions we let him sleep in the living room or upstairs on my bed where he feels safe, but it's normally rare.

But the last few weeks he has been acting spooked even when there's nothing to be spooked about. He protests heavily going into his crate and then whines and scratches until I give in. I started just letting him into the living room but even that isn't good enough now. He wants to be up with me on my bed.

He doesn't seem to be doing it for attention. He is panting and shaking, genuinely frightened. I've seen his begging for attention behaviour and this isn't it. He trembles and pants for a good 20 minutes before he finally relaxes and goes to sleep next to me.

I don't mind him being up here on occasion, and the spaniel is absolutely fine down there on his own (probably prefers it). But I really don't want it to become a habit we can't break. I live with my parents and I don't want him to suffer if I am not home or when I eventually move out. He used to see his crate as his safe space, but seemingly doesn't anymore.

I think part of the problem is that his crate is right by the back door and they have a dog flap which I think lets in sounds of the outside (wind, rain, foxes, other dogs etc). But I don't know how to fix that because there is nowhere else for his crate. We have started blocking the dog flap up because even though they never used to use it at night, he has started running out and barking at every sound and no doubt waking the neighborhood.

How can I help him get back into his routine and be comfortable with it?

He did have surgery this year that had a long and intense recovery period (TPLO), which I wonder could be part of the problem. Could he be in pain that worsens at night? Could the stress of the surgery and recovery have made him more anxious and therefore more needy?

I really don't know.

490,dogs,"We just brought home a 1 year old Beagle/Plott Hound pup 3 days ago. We're technically in a 2 week foster-to-adopt to ensure that he's a good fit for out home - we have a 2 year old Beagle/Bulldog mix and 2 cats, age 5 &amp; 7. One cat is very skittish in general, the other is a tough guy that likes to be in charge. We got our cats from family (needed to be rehomed) at the same time, before we got our first pup, and during dog searching our top priority has always been the safety and wellbeing of our cats. We obviously do not want them to be in any kind of danger when bringing in a new animal, so we've been making sure all dogs we consider are noted as cat-friendly.

The new pup is a very sweet and loving boy, and is getting along great with our 2 year old pup. However, his interactions with the cats have been less than ideal. 

On our first day with him, we kept him separated in a room from the other animals to get acquainted with the new atmosphere. We did eventually put a baby gate up to meet our dog, and they seemed to hit it off so we let them together with good success. However, each time he saw the cats through the gate, he would bark/howl at them and jump on the gate, which felt like maybe a normal response at first. 

He was coexisting in a room with the cats well yesterday - he stayed on a leash and was pulling/lunging and barking at them for a couple minutes, but them relaxed a bit and, while checking them out often, never barked/lunged again. However today felt like a massive step backwards - every single time he sees one today, he is lunging and barking like crazy, obsessing over where they run to. His bark feels a bit more aggressive now too (but he's a beagle, so it's hard to tell, his bark always sounds a bit aggressive)

He's been within arms reach of one on the leash, and wasn't doing anything alarming when he was that close (the cat was hissing but he was not phased). I'm just very worried because I would be devastated if something happened to our kits. Is this kind of behavior something that could be normal in the beginning when he hasn't really been able to meet the cats, or is this a more aggressive behavior that'll only stay the same/get worse?",t2_rrx3wfus,0,Is our dog behaving aggressively towards out cats?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,1070prl,True,Palindomir,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1070prl/is_our_dog_behaving_aggressively_towards_out_cats/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1070prl/is_our_dog_behaving_aggressively_towards_out_cats/,2480329,1673227739,0,,False,1673227754,1673227754,2023-01-09 01:28:59,,,,,

496,dogs,"Before you come at me saying my dog has separation anxiety or isn't getting enough exercise, consider the following. I just took my dog to the park today. I also tried throwing her toys around, but she was  preoccupied with one toy . When I try to throw another toy, she won't chase after it. When I try to get the toy she trots off. She is normally around me, but while my mom was gone, she got into a ziplock bag with a charger in it. She would never do that when my mom is near the table. It's not separation anxiety either because she will whine and scratch at the door when she is anxious and has defecated in the house. She'll just go around sniffing things, acting like she's all ""innocent"" and ""polite,"" but I'm not falling for it. I tried to exercise her, and she wouldn't chase after the toy, and she went to the park today too, and STILL insists on chewing things. She normally hangs around my room  unless she's being exercised and played with, but she wasn't in my room and left on HER terms. I just don't believe she's innocent in this because the second I caught her, she crouched and ran straight to my room. If she didn't know she wasn't supposed to do what she did, she'd probably not wait until no one was looking in order to do what she did. If I was there, she wouldn't have done what she did. I put all this effort in and it's frusterating as fuck to know that none of it is paying off when I exercised her and she's not anxious.

510,dogs,"Hi all - would appreciate any guidance you have here!

My partner (M) and I (F) adopted our dog in June 2022, and she is now a bit over a year old. She is a mutt (leopard hound/boxer/german shepherd/pittie/lab mix, according to the DNA test). I work a hybrid schedule but am in the office several days each week, while my partner works from home every day. 

Right around the time that our dog settled (after we had her for 3 months), we noticed she started bonding more with me. At first it was just coming to me more for snuggles, but at this point she follows me around the house, sleeps next to or on top of my legs, listen to commands better to me, behaves better on walks, etc. 

While it disappoints my partner that she doesn't pick him as often for snuggles and isn't as affectionate with him, especially since he does spend more time with her, the trouble is that her behavior with him is markedly worse than it is with me. He sent me several videos today of them on the walk together where she was picking up sticks, biting the leash, digging, and basically trying to wrestle. When they got home, she voluntarily went into her crate and destroyed her bed - what we call full monster mode. She's always been high energy, but has tons of chewies and toys available and had two longer walks already. As soon as I got home, she followed me around the house and then curled up on my lap to take a nap. 

This shift in behavior has been causing difficulties between my partner and I. To me, she is such a sweet dog (albeit young and does need continued training, but her full monster mode days are so much rarer for me). With my partner, she is much more prone to temper tantrums and general bad behavior, like pulling on walks, picking up sticks, etc. We're having a hard time figuring out how to handle this because she won't listen to my partner.

517,dogs,"I'm not sure what do with this situation. I'm at my wit's end and I genuinely have no idea where to start.

I have 2 dogs, both female, both mixed breed, both neutered, both rescues, both raised from a very young age. The oldest is 7 and I raised her from 3 months old, and the youngest is 2 who was abandoned and I raised from 6 weeks alongside the other.

About 1.5yrs ago I moved into my own home which is super close to my parents' home. Both dogs stay with my parents while my husband and I are out or at work, and the oldest sleeps at my parents' house but stays with me the rest of the day when I'm home. Before I turn in to sleep I take her to my parents' and she sleeps there. It's a weird arrangement but it's worked so far with minimal issues for everyone involved. She has slept over at my house on occasion, and my youngest has slept over at my parents' on occasion too.

Over the past year or even more, I've been finding pee on my side of the bed at random times. At times I've gone months without, and I've found it multiple days in a row at other times. Today I finally found out it was my oldest. She went in my room (the doggy door for the yard is there) and within 5min she had peed on the bed and come back to snuggle on the sofa. We had been snuggled up until that point, there was no negative energy or anything, I hadn't yelled at her or disciplined her or anything as far as I'm aware.

My husband says it's her way of marking her territory, a sign of jealousy for my other dog. Is this possible? If so, why is it so random? They play together and snuggle together and sleep together and they're rarely ever apart. Could it be a medical issue? Could it be something else completely? 

How would you handle this? What's the best way to discipline her?

520,dogs,"I had this dog since I was a child, he is a pomeranian with dark brown fur and was such a happy dog back in his early days when he had more freedom. he was able to roam the house, sleep on the couch, rest near my feet at the dinner table. But one day my father snapped, he became a clean freak and grew increasingly sick of my dog's dirty paws marking *his precious glossy wooden tile floor.* So the dog was now confined to a storage room at my house's back door for the rest of his days, the only places he would be was that room and my big backyard (which somewhat compensated for his confinement but I felt it was never good enough.)   


Over the next few years I became more and more neglectful of my dog due to school and other personal matters, I simply had no time to take care of the dog. I could've given him away earlier but I was too selfish to let him go, and I still regret that decision to this day. Me and the dog grew apart, isolated from each other. The only time we met during my days was when I let him outside, filled his water bowl, and fed him. I never played with him anymore, which is something I also regret.  


So fast forward to the present, my dog is severely ill and crippled....constantly coughing and limping. He is taking prednisone because the vet said so, but it seemed to have made things much worse. He peed more uncontrollably, he was really stressed, and couldn't walk correctly and open slid on the ground as he walked. And today, I believe I am seeing the end. He can barely even move and his coughs have become even worse. With each cough I could hear a slight whimper. He sounds like he is in so much agony.   


He no longer even wants to be petted anymore, and often ducks his head away from my head when I tried to comfort him. He is not eating anymore by himself, he needs me to hold the dog food to his mouth. It feels like I am taking care of a very sick dying elderly man (and well, the dog is 15 years old. He is pretty much a grandpa). Everytime I get close to his room he gives me this glare, staring me directly in the eyes. Its like he wants me to know just how bad I fucked up and I cannot blame him.  


I am thinking of telling my mother and father to bring him to the vet one last time....to put him out of his misery. The dog is constantly in pain and will not stop coughing and whimpering until he is asleep, in his sleep he looked peaceful. I feel like the best thing I can do for him is to put him to sleep for good. Keeping him alive seems more unethical and selfish now.   


I don't even know how I am going to cope with the years of guilt after he dies. I can't even look at him now. Simply looking at him in so much pain makes me want to cry. I simply cannot imagine how it would feel to be like him, and being forced to remain alive in so much pain.",t2_75hiogud,0,"Looks like my dog's days are nearing their end, and I regret taking our time for granted","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,106v3qd,True,TheS0ulessJackal,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/106v3qd/looks_like_my_dogs_days_are_nearing_their_end_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/106v3qd/looks_like_my_dogs_days_are_nearing_their_end_and/,2480210,1673213869,0,,False,1673213881,1673213882,2023-01-08 21:37:49,,,,,

528,dogs,"My dog is 11 years old and is healthy! She has no pre-existing conditions, and loves to have zoomies and munch on treats. She began growing a proliferation near her mammary glands approximately 6-9 month ago, and it has grown to the size of a lemon. So I grew concerned about this and brought her to the vet, where they told us she would need that removed and also found another mammary gland growth. Both were tested, and as I said earlier, the lemon sized one was a proliferation, while the small one (grape sized) came back as a neoplasia (aka cancer). The vet recommended getting both removed with good margins and also spaying her as she is intact (to hopefully prevent these from growing back in the future). As well, both growths would then be sent to a lab for further testing.

I‚Äôve been freaking myself out by reading horror stories of people losing their healthy dogs during surgery. This has caused me to be so anxious about the procedure and reconsidering if this is something I should put her through. Ive spoken to my vet who has said considering all the tests and that she is healthy, the procedure should be fine. To ease some anxiety, we also got a second opinion from another vet and they say the same thing. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep/eat the past couple days leading up to her surgery. And I apologize for not getting her spayed earlier in her life, we were extremely poor and couldn‚Äôt afford it at the time.

Super sad incident of another innocent victim to an unrestrained pit bull.

I love dogs, but in the last few weeks, when I went to public outdoor shopping plazas, there have been several occasions where I have had to go out of my way to avoid a dog owner who was walking their pit bulls out in public among the crowds.

One was a lady who was walking two fairly large pit bulls on a leash, and freely walked into large crowds of people.  Yesterday, another guy was walking his large pit bull, again into the crowd in the shopping plaza.  I had to go out of my way to avoid being close to the owner or the dogs, just to avoid any potential conflict.

Dog owners need to be aware of the liability of exposing their dogs in public. Some people in public are afraid of dogs, regardless of breed.  Do not let them freely roam in public or walk them close to crowds.  

I have a friend who was recently bitten by a neighbors dog, and is now going through medical treatment for the bite.  The dog was a fairly small dog, and the owner chose to put the dog down because of the potential future liability. Very sad case. Please watch your dogs, make sure they are not let loose or walk them close to crowds or strangers.

However, my friend who he had to spend Christmas with reported that he was a VERY gassy boy while there. He ate the same as always, didn't show signs of high stress, but it was of course exciting/new to be with another family (and there puppy) for a few hours.

Now today I had some visitors, again he ate the same diet as usual, but shortly after the guests arrived he started tooting up a storm. xD

Again, no sign or negative stress or discomfort. He gets very excited when we have guests but calms down considerably after 5-10min. Still, it's an unusual and stimulating situation (we had 5 people over, 2 of which he knew). It's now been 2h since they left and the farting has stopped  (thankfully, since he sleeps in my bed!) Poop was normal on our evening walk as well. 

Since the excitement is the only constant here, I'm wondering if it can affect his gut that much or if there's something else going on?

Also, any tips to reduce the farting (or at least the smell) a little bit would be appreciated as well!

541,dogs,"We started noticing this behavior about 6 months ago. We had moved to our current apartment 2 months prior to that. Our dog started showing signs of fear/anxiety during walks in our neighborhood (tail tucked, backing away when we were trying to walk forward, not taking treats). The trigger seemed to be some beeping sounds that could be heard in the neighborhood; we live in the inner city and there are other apartments, trucks, etc. where sounds can come from. She would also start hiding under our bed when we started to hear beeps from outside faintly from inside our apartment. She likes to lay/chill under our bed in general, but it started to feel like she was retreating under the bed when she heard beeps. She also has storm anxiety and we live in a coastal city where lightning and thunder aren‚Äôt uncommon. She exhibits similar but heightened anxious behavior when there‚Äôs a storm. 

Fast forward to now - over the last 6 months it seemed like her anxiety around the neighborhood had eased and would only come up once in a while, randomly, and then go away for long stretches. We could hear beeping still but she didn‚Äôt seem to care most of the time. Over the last week or so though, her anxiety been back and in full force. It‚Äôs been exacerbated because last week the fire alarm went off in the building, and we had to leave the apartment while the building fixed the issue. But the alarm was VERY loud and she was horrified. Then a few days later, the fire alarm goes off again, just for a few seconds, but it‚Äôs enough to spook her. We also had a storm roll in last night. She spends all day under the bed nowadays, even though the general beeping sounds in the neighborhood can only be heard (by us at least) occasionally, and the fire alarm hasn‚Äôt gone off since that last incident. 

I don‚Äôt know what we should do to help her feel less anxious. We try to give her treats when we hear the beeping and during storms, but she insists on staying under the bed and won‚Äôt take treats if she‚Äôs too scared. Should we let her stay under the bed whenever she wants since she finds it to be a safe place? It feels like she‚Äôs under there all the time even when none of the triggers are around, and I don‚Äôt know if we should keep her out in the living room to discourage that behavior or let her do what she wants. Any suggestions are very appreciated!

548,dogs,"My dog (australian shepherd and poodle) is about 2 years old and constantly anxious-barks. It's especially terrible when we travel with the dog.

We tried to socialize him early, tried creating noise outside the house and doing positive reinforcement. He mostly knows ""quiet,"" but will only *be quiet* if there's active commands and treats involved. He's been extremely receptive to other kinds of training.

He screams in the yard, in the house, wakes us up at night. 

To be clear, he NEVER barks because he wants something, it's always just at the most innocuous noises, roommates walking around, seeing something outside the house, people talking or closing car doors outside or even just walking past the house. We live on the second story too! He's so sensitive! 

&amp;#x200B;

He usually gets pretty decent exercise: walks or runs at least once a day, an hour of fetch at the dog park every other day, plus playing tug and wrestling 5-6 times a day with lots of self-play toys.

&amp;#x200B;

He just has the most shrill and loud scream and honestly, I'm starting to feel resentful of him (which I feel bad about as well). I feel like he'd be a perfect travel companion (we were excited to travel with him and got him as a travel buddy) except that he's a constant liability because he won't stop screaming in everyone's ear/blowing our cover.

553,dogs,"Hi,
I'm the owner of a 1,5 years old finnish lapphund named Milo.
He is my first ever dog, so I know that these little problems my dog has are because of my inexperience.
I've watched many videos, read many articles and had help from 3 different dog trainers with different approaches. Some problems have become a bit easier but there's still plenty of work to be done.

These are the things I'd like advice on: 
- Reactivity, Milo starts barking, growling and lunging at every dog we see on our walks. Sometimes even when the dog is far far away. 
When he does this, he does not react to any commands, nor regular treats he usually likes. 

- Barking at every noise he hears in the stairway when we're at home. 

- Lunging, barking, nipping and jumping when greeting people. 

- Occasionally barking and growling at other people. I don't know how he chooses which people to bark at, it seems really random. Some he ignores, some he starts barking at. 

- Completely ignoring commands he knows very well when we're outside. Sniffing the ground is much more fun.

I have picked a nice, usually empty area in the forest, which has a nice open area and a forest path for walks.

Today we were not that lucky. We met with our friends puppy at the open area and went on for a walk. Not even 5 minutes into the path (I was walking with our older dog first) we see loose malinois without owners. I looked back to warn others that we have an unleashed dog ahead when that dog charged at my Shetland sheepdog full speed. I got in the way, so the initial attack was not successful, but after that the dog latched on my dog‚Äôs throat and he started whining. I tried to grab the collar of malinois to choke her, but could not catch her as she kept biting and my dog was moving around (I kept him on leash, but allowed some movement). Then my husband came, grabbed malinois hind legs and lifted them, and she let go of our dog. The owner of malinois came and held his dog, while we comforted and looked for any injuries our. Thankfully our dog did not seem injured. The owners of the malinois said sorry and moved on, we continued our walk as well.

My dog is currently on Purina Pro Plan, just the regular beef recipe. I switched him from ONE because I wanted to see if it would be kinder on his stomach due to the added probiotics. It might be, but ONE was generally okay for him as well.

He has anxiety and we've tried the Calming Care probiotics before, with maybe some results but nothing magical. He does take an anxiety medication. It's not really in the budget to add the Calming Care into Pro Plan, plus Pro Plan has probiotics anyway so I was wondering if that would be a bit redundant? But I could switch him back to ONE and then add the probiotics to that.

I had previously had a Doberman who lived a beautiful 11 years! It took me three years to garner the courage to get another puppy and I chose a ShihTzu

45 days old, vaccinated and with paperwork to see his lineage 

I got him home from the breeder on 6th January 2022 at 6pm! 

He was very happy, playing, dancing etc 

Gave him his meal as directed by the breeder though I did realise he was passing smelly gas at night

Next morning, his energy level reduced and he was passing loose motion.

He then began to vomit, and rushed him to a nearby Vet who gave him saline and medicines via IV

Came back to find him puking again and his stomach was a bit bulged. Was rushing him to the hospital, he made a huge noise and took his last breath.

The vet found blood in his poop and she suspected Parvo. He was already vaccinated with DHPP though

569,dogs,"I took my dog (1-year-old mixed breed) to the vet for a limp that was not getting better over time.

She examined him, thought it was probably patellar luxation, and wanted to do x-rays so I agreed. She came back and said that he won't sit still for the x-rays so they need to sedate him which would cost more and I agreed. When the X-rays were in she said she wasn't good at reading them and wanted to call a radiographer or something which she said would cost more, and I agreed. After all this, she and her assistant came to me both very agitated. They said my dog had not only patellar luxation, but also an ACL injury in his other knee and also that he needed a hip replacement, and immediately started shaming me that I shouldn't try to kill him because of this. They suggest that I find an orthopedic surgeon. All of this cost me $1,000.

I found a great orthopedic surgeon who examined him. He said the prior X-rays were overexposed and on completely unreadable and that he would have to do his own which would cost. After this, the surgeon said he only had patellar luxation, did not have the other problems, and fortunately for me he only needed one surgery which would be about 3K, much less than I was expecting when I thought it would be three surgeries. Total cost of this consultation, which was basically a do-over of the prior visit, was $300. So we have that scheduled and we're going to do it.

My question is this. I got some wrong information and I'm now really questioning the original vets competence. I feel like this kind of a competence issue is almost like a borderline malpractice issue, because number one they put me in a great deal of mental distress about the health of my dog, projected that I would have to pay you know over $10,000 for surgery, and charged $1,000 even just to tell me that, and it turns out that almost all of their diagnosis was completely false. 

I feel like I want to call them and get my money back because basically we had to do a complete do-over of their visit, but a competent vet, who was also a specialist and reasonably reasonably should be the one charging more, charged 1/3 of what they did. I don't expect that they will refund me 100%, but I want to ask for something and see what happens. Is this reasonable? If I feel like I'm completely unhappy with their response to this I could dispute the charge on my credit card, but I'd rather not have to do that.

My ten year old male lab has recently started having accidents in the house quite frequently, despite our best efforts to prevent them. He has been behaving normally in every other way-still active, eating normally, etc.

We took him to the vet when this first started (he has been having the accidents for about four months now) and the vet checked for a uti or bladder issue and could not find anything.

He has another vet appointment coming up, since this keeps persisting. But in the meantime (the soonest appointment our vet had was at the end of the month), I want to look into some diapers for him since this is becoming more than a weekly thing. 

We have tried letting him out more frequently, and even limiting his access to water at night (I know, not a good idea, we only did this for one night). We have also tried blocking his access to the area he usually has accidents in, but that just lead to him having them elsewhere. So I think a diaper is really our only choice for now.

583,dogs,"Context, an aunt I don't like left for the US and she'll be there a year with her husband and two kids, and she left her Chihuahua, ""Kin"" with us. When I went to pick him up he was extremely scared. He barked most of the ride and when I tried to pick him up he bit me. An hour of me gradually getting closer, he let me pet him and I was finally able to pick him up and get him into my house. That was about two weeks ago. It almost feels like I'm fostering a rescue dog.

Now, Kin has been slowly adapting. We keep him inside because we have three other dogs, a SharPei and two Dogo Argentino. He still pees inside the house even when we take him out for walks. He had a really hard time getting used to the collar, and it was even worse with the leash. He still cries like he's being tortured when I try to walk him. He won't sleep away from me and I always wake up to him on my bed and under my blanket (not that I mind, but I'm leaving for uni again as soon as the holidays are over and I'm not allowed dogs in the apartment I live in). 

And he also cries when we leave him in the fenced part of the garden. He shivers and cries and whines and I'm literally six feet away. He takes some time to calm down. 

I don't like seeing him suffering, but I can't just have him on my lap or up on my shoulder all the time (he likes that). I have to feed my other dogs, I have to make breakfast and help my parents clean the house. I also have to study. 

Anyone has any recommendations for dealing with this?

Also, if you look through my post history you'll see my parents are a) both over 50, b) really busy all the time, and c) not exactly the most responsible owners (they border on neglectful, except with the two Dogos that they take to training sessions regularly).

585,dogs,"I have 3 dogs with varying degrees of recall, especially when calling them back into the house. Usually, I let them tell me when they want to come in, but sometimes I have things to do and i need them to come in. I decided I want to stop using ""come"" because too often, the command was given, not followed, and not corrected. So, I decided to teach them that when I whistle three times, if they come in the house they get a high value treat. It has worked well.

One of my dogs, the least biddable one, who learns the fastest and is most comfortable with ignoring me when my wants and her wants don't match, has one again learned how to game the system.  

It's cold, so the other two usually present themselves at the door fairly quickly.  I let the last one stay out because she's part husky and loves the cold. Now, when she barks at the door to come in, when I open it, she takes a few steps back, sits down, and looks at me expectantly.

...she's waiting for me to whistle so she can get her treat! If I just close the door, she will come to it and bark when I walk away, and the whole sequence repeats. I love this clever girl so much! There are times I think I would not be surprised if she started speaking!

605,dogs,"Hey all!

So my boy (2yo) has a little friend (9mo), both intact males. The puppy is half is size but double his energy level. xD

I get along super well with the owner so we meet quite often. However, I'm not sure if the dogs really enjoy it or at what point it might become more stressful for the puppy (or both).

They are very excited to see each other (well, my dog is excited to see anyone xD), but then they'll only chase each other a bit and then go on to ignore each other mostly. Sometimes the little one still tries to initiate play but my dog often ignores him or growls a little when he gets annoyed, so by now the pup leaves him alone more often to just run and sniff by himself.

However, my dog gets really dominant when 1) there's toys involved (or just a random stick he picked up), 2) there's a female around, 3) I give the little one more attention, 4) puppy gets a treat and he doesn't (we don't usually do that, but the owner's son sometimes forgets).

He'll growl, bark, jump at the little one, who usually just runs away. If he's not fast enough, my boy will press him to the ground and kind of sit on him when he's already laying belly up. He also took a snack right out of his mouth ones, which the puppy just... accepted.
There's no biting or even nipping happening as far as I can tell. 

Puppy's owner says it's all normal and good that the little one also learns that not everybody wants to play with him all the time and he needs to be submissive with other males sometimes to avoid conflict. I'm just unsure because this is my first dog and I guess from my human point of view it's a but weird to watch him act ""aggressive"" towards a ""child"".

He was not like this until he was 7 months old. 

Note that we've never ever hurt him with anything, our other dogs are respectful and fine. 

- The first time was when I was petting him as I normally would, he then attacked me which I was not bitten yet. I observed that I was looking at his eyes before he attacked. 
- The second time when he was chewing an house item and was about to get the item and he attacked me which poked a wound on my wrist (the scar is still here now). This is more understandable than the previous one. 
- Our neighbor which always adored him experience the same thing when she was simply looking at him through our gate. 
- The third time happened just now, when I was petting him again. He bit my hair aggressively as I stood up, for a few moments before he let go.

I've been thinking and planning on adopting a sibling for her. In my head I've planned on/ wanted a pitbull mix. They are so active which is necessary for my job. They're also so sweet and playful. Jenny plays great with coworkers pits. But I think the kicker here is I'M DRAWN TO THEM. I find them to he so beyond adorable and sweet and I just jive with their vibe in all the best ways.

But, over Christmas weekend, I fostered a dog for the first time. It was chaotic at the rescue and I just sort of ended up with this young shepherd mix looking girl. Her name is Cora. She was timid at first but she warmed up so quickly. 

Once I fostered her and she was so good at learning and wanting to hang with us, I think I felt a pressure to adopt her even though she wasn't necessarily the family member I would have chosen. I also felt she would likely get adopted quickly because she is so young, sweet and naturally well behaved. 

I fostered her again over new years weekend. 

Over these two weeks I constantly wrestled with myself over adopting her or not. 

I think I felt like a bad person to not choose her because she's not the breed or aesthetic I had in mind? I thought I got past that and committed. 

Now that I've adopted her, I'm so freaked out feeling like I adopted out of guilt instead of the family member I was looking for.

Just loves and kisses with this dog, he got a liking of my dad more than Me, The volunteers then told us what his issue was and I was in shock. So in his past owners, he gets aggressive when there is food around with other dogs, so if someone dropped food and there was a dog around trying to get it too, he'll get aggressive, so they told us to not have extra dogs, which we could agree on, but the bigger problem is that he had killed another dog before because he was left alone in the house with the food bowl left on the floor, so that meant high prey drive on the dog, I wanted more details, but there wasn't really any, just the owners came back home to their dog dead, they had to put him into an animal shelter. He is still a baby, and I just didn't know how to react, but I fell in love with him when I got to meet him, super playful, loves kisses, and just gives hugs to everyone he meets.

Well, about a month ago I moved in with my aunt. She owns a Norwegian elkhound (male), Rocky. And a shepherd mix (female), Sasha. Minnie and I moved in, and her and Rocky are pretty tight now. Rocky is definitely an alpha male, big baby, ‚Äúbully.‚Äù But he actually gets pretty scared of Minnie, haha.

So we caved and are trying to see if it would work out for him to also move in with us while my brother is away. Rocky and Blue have played so well together in the past, but something will trigger Rocky and just start attacking Blue. Rocky is territorial of his home and his family, understandably.

Blue is submissive, laid back, doesn‚Äôt care about much. Rocky is just constantly asserting dominance in ridiculous situations.

620,dogs,"Hi guys 

I have a 3 year old Splurcher. And she's a typical lurcher, hates the rain, dark, cold &amp; wet. So we've struggled in winter to get her out. 

Im a biz owner and I'm considering opening an indoor dog park in my area

Basic idea. 

Huge warehouse 
Hourly slots. 
Big dog area 
Little dog area
Puppy sessions 

Toys
Sand pits
Paddle pools
Agility course 
Softplay 
Toys
Balls

Cafe/seating area 
.
Owners stay for the duration and clean up any mess 
Dogs get to play with each other. 
Gets owners out the house to meet like-minded people

Theres potential to expand into doggy daycare but for now I'm concentrating on the indoor park ..

Would you use it? 

All comments, questions, critiques welcome... I obviously want to make it work... But am I seeing the idea through rose tinted glasses...

His lil tail was tucked between his legs and he seemed scared, but also super sweet. 

He was super skiddish about coming into our house, but did eventually when prompted with some food. He kept going to the door so we let him back out, but then he came back to our door and came right back inside.

624,dogs,"
I apologize if formatting is off, I‚Äôm a mobile user. 


1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

We both grew up with dogs, but have not had one since venturing out on our own. 
I have worked with dogs for 8+ years in daycare, assisting training classes, rescue, and grooming. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Definitely going for a reputable breeder 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

A dog who is ready to go on adventures with us, but also won‚Äôt mind a day of being indoors. Friendly, and quick to learn is a definite want. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We‚Äôre thinking Vizsla, I have had the benefit of working with a lot them and absolutely fell in love with them! They feel like a good fit for us, but we‚Äôre still deciding before we commit. 

Standard poodles have been considered but the grooming needs are too much for us. 

Whippets are another option, but off leash trainability is important and I haven‚Äôt met too many with a solid recall. 

Labs are on the list because we both grew up with them, and who doesn‚Äôt love a good lab. 

My dream dog is a Belgian malinois, but that would probably never happen lol. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience and tricks, will also need to be a good shop dog for both of our jobs. Off leash trainability is a want, and we‚Äôre looking to get into dog sports as well. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Depends on the breed and individuals drive! 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Hard question to answer as both of us are able to work from home/bring dog to work. So pretty much as much as possible. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2+ hours daily plus brainwork. We try to get out as much as possible (but it‚Äôs a little hard in the winter lol)

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Ear cleaning and nails are no problem. Would prefer a dog that does not require professional grooming, but am open to most double coated breeds. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not into slobber, don‚Äôt want a mega barker, shedding is eh (it will just add to the collection of cat hair)

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A bit of both 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Eager to please, but can be independent 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

With indifference. Don‚Äôt want a dog that will be overly excited to meet people, but is still friendly and able to greet someone. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not at this point in my life

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Jumping, countersurfing, just general things no one really likes 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not very, we wfh or are able to bring dog to work. Occasional nights out or days when we can‚Äôt bring dog with us. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Same as mine, we‚Äôll both be involved with dog care. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

A sweet little cat

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Occasionally 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We rent in a complex with no restrictions (all the dogs here are huskies, shepherds, and pitties)

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

BC, Canada. No bsl in my city 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Lately, 40C summers and -20C winters 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

Nothing I can think of that hasn‚Äôt been covered

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

628,dogs,"My dear folks, I‚Äôm looking for advice, reassurance, validation? Idk any input really. 

I have not had a proper vacation for a few years. The last 2-3 years have not been kind to me to say the least, so back in May I planned an 8-day solo vacation of my dreams. I‚Äôm crossing off many items of the bucket list and am super excited about it. Feel the ‚Äòbut‚Äô incoming?

I have a two year old toy poodle. He is my everything. I know that sounds very clich√©, but we are very bonded. I am not close with my family (abusive environment growing up) and I have been living in a town with no close friends nearby. I have cPTSD and he is my rock through trying to heal from MANY traumas. My close friends live in a city about 3 hrs away so it‚Äôs just me and him most of the time. 

I have left him before with a sitter he knows very well, and other than being MAD lol when i come back, he would have a great time otherwise. This sitter is not an option anymore as she moved. The most we have been apart is 6 days. This time, it will be around 10 days apart. 

A close friend‚Äôs sister offered to watch him while I‚Äôm gone. She also lives in the city three hours away. My dog doesn‚Äôt know her, but we had a plan to introduce them before we leave. My dog is great with humans AND all other dogs, so I didn‚Äôt think of any issues. I was especially satisfied because she and her bf live together and also have a toy poodle, and my doggo is obsessed with all doodles and other poodles - we frequently joke he‚Äôs racist because he prefers them over other breeds. This is the case both in the daycare he goes to and the dog park we frequent. Anyway, this is just to say that I thought he would love a buddy to play with. When we all met up, my dog was straight up scared of the other poodle! I was very confused - I‚Äôve never seen this reaction from him to ANY dog, ever. He did not want to interact although the other poodle boy was very friendly and playful, but my dog was hiding from him. My friend and her sister were both there and while confused still not concerned at all, saying it‚Äôs all good and when they have more time together, they will both adapt. The other poodle is quite a bit older (10ish), is well socialized, and other than occasional humping which my dog also tries on other dogs sometimes (both neutered), no serious behavioral issues are present. 

Let me add that I am definitely an over-thinker. So I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs okay and what‚Äôs not to be honest- like am I crazy to be worried? I‚Äôm scared he will be miserable this entire time. I‚Äôm scared if they‚Äôre left alone my dog will be VERY stressed. I‚Äôm scared he will be stressed no matter what. I‚Äôm scared that, if this is the case, he will be longterm affected. He is very sensitive as poodles tend to be. On the other hand, I try to tell myself that dogs adapt and he will be fine. Probably end up being bffs with the other boy. He is very good with other dogs and befriends even the grumpiest ones at daycare. I‚Äôm imagining that, even in the worst case scenario, it‚Äôs still only about 10 days of his entire life so should I even be this concerned? I also sometimes think this may be good for both of us - to separate and for new exposure and experience for him. 

I‚Äôm just confused all around, so please tell me if I‚Äôm crazy?? ‚ò†Ô∏è will he be fine and I need to chill? All my friends and even my therapist say it will be okay. They all mostly understand my concern/situation, and think I need to use this to practice chill. Yet another joke is that I have separation anxiety üò• I do for sure.

629,dogs,"In light of my 14-year-old whippet, Tyson, passing, I wanted to share my experience with chronic kidney disease, heart disease and arthritis in dogs. I'm not a veterinarian and this is NOT medical advice, just my experience! I only intend for this post to shed some light on what it may look like for other dog owners!

2019: Tyson at age 10 is diagnosed with a heart murmur. He is slightly overweight though pretty active.

\~

June 2022: We notice Tyson is drinking significantly more water than usual.

Early August 2022: Tyson, 13 years old, is struggling with urine incontinence.  
\- After a visit to the vet and a blood test, he is diagnosed with stage 2-3 Kidney disease, and arthritis and his heart murmur has gotten worse.

Late August 2022: In response to his diagnosis, Tyson is medicated with:  
\- Gabapentin 300mg twice a day (for arthritis)  
\- Vetmedin chewable tablets, 2.5mg twice a day (for heart murmur)   
A prescription diet for kidney disease is put in place. We wrap pills in meat to administer. 

September 2022: Tyson is not taking well to the new diet, having tried both the Royal Canin brand and Hill's. Urine incontinence is lessened but still present. Vet tries to take urine sample but there is blood in the urine.

October 2022: Tyson deteriorates overnight. He is unable to walk, refuses to eat and is drinking a lot of water, he's seizing (going rigid and quivering), his incontinence has worsened, has diarrhoea and has a very high temperature. We bring him to the emergency vet.  
\- His Kidney disease has progressed to stage 4 and is poisoning him. Blood in urine so he is prescribed antibiotics, pro-biotics for diarrhoea and Zofran Zydis 8mg wafer for nausea. 

After medicating his condition improves drastically, though his energy stays low.

Late October 2022: Tyson has finished his antibiotics and pro-biotics, so we seek to bring the anti-nausea medication into his regular regime (8mg twice a day). At the vet appointment, Synovan injections are raised as a treatment for his arthritis, as his walking has become impaired. This becomes a regular injection every four weeks, and is hugely impactful.

November 2022: Incontinence is still present, which we have resigned ourselves to. We utilise reusable incontinence pads to manage symptoms. His diet is still a source of stress and due to his refusal to eat, we scrap the kidney disease diet and stick to regular wet dog food instead. (We have entirely removed any 'human food' from his diet) His heart medication is boosted from 2.5mg twice daily to 5mg twice daily.

December 2022: Tyson's condition is no longer improving, only fluctuating from good to bad to worse, and back to good. Signs of confusion begin to show (getting lost in a familiar place, hard of hearing, etc) On a holiday to a family home which he knows very well, he gets lost in the garden. 

January 2023: On a trip up to another location he knows very well, his back begins to fail and walking becomes very difficult. His confusion worsens to the point where he has lost a lot of his 'personality'. He refuses to eat and drinks a lot of water. 

7th January 2023: We make the hard decision to book at-home euthanasia, and drive him back home. He is barely able to walk but does eat some treats, (salami and pulled pork). He is euthanised.

This is not at all going to be the universal prognosis for kidney disease, heart disease or arthritis. This is my experience and I hope it may help to give a glimpse into what some treatments may look like, or signs to keep an eye on. Always seek medical advice from a licenced veterinarian.

Within 5\~ months of diagnosis and treatment for kidney disease, Tyson passed. His treatment may have been more successful if his heart disease did not prevent a lot of the more successful methods like fluid treatment.

630,dogs,"I'm from the West Coast and am visiting family on the East Coast. On the way here, United Airlines told me that my dog wouldn't be allowed in-cabin, saying that she didn't have enough room in the carrier. I've flown with this dog carrier before, it's the maximum size recommended (18x11x11) and she can comfortably stand and turn around (I'll admit she can't crane her neck all the way up, but she can hold her head level and is otherwise okay). She fits under the seat just fine in it. 

I was ultimately able to get onto the plane, but now headed back I'm worried the gate agent won't allow us on at all. I'm wondering what my options are if that happens. I don't believe United puts pets in cargo. I believe Alaska and Southwest still do, but to be honest would really rather avoid that if possible. Here's what I'm curious about in order of preference:

1. I'm willing to buy a larger soft carrier and a new plane ticket if any airlines allow larger than 18x11x11 soft-bodied carriers in-cabin. Does anyone know if that's possible?

2. If that's not possible, I'm willing to buy a hard-bodied carrier and a new plane ticket on Alaska or Southwest. What has been people's experience with them lately?

3. Is there any other option besides driving across country with my dog?

640,dogs,"Buckle up because this is a long story (feel free to skip to below the ----- to just hear the issue) 

I live at home with my folks (I am an adult but with the living situation, times that's in it, and the fact I do carer for them both it just worked out best this way). 

Start of pandemic I decided I was getting a dog ( the other two we had were elderly and we wanted a new one to be with them to learn from them while they still ran around). With the high energy and drive of them, I am personally not a fan of jack Russells, my dad on the other hand adores them. I see the lure, but they just are not for me. 

Naturally since I live with my folks I discussed getting another dog with them and they were fine with it, I mentioned I didn't want a JRT for reasons above, and named a few breeds in the discussion that I would be interested in (corgi, king Charles, shihtzu etc) 

My birthday came around and my dad sent my brother to get me a dog as a surprise, my brother came back with a jack Russell. My dad ended up altering the name I gave her to the name of a dog from his childhood who also was a JRT. That was fine, in fact I loved to see dad get involved and love her. However, just as I feared, she is extremely high energy, I genuinely think she would need a top notch athlete to exercise her efficiently. 

Non the less, I have tried super hard to exercise her between with puzzle games for meals, playing fetch and other games to keep her busy. It's clear she's my dad's dog since he loves her so much. 
Not long after she arrived 3-4 months maybe, our oldest girl passed away, we were so glad we had this pup because the old lil guy left would have been lost if it wasn't for her to keep him going. 

After she passed, about 5-6 months later, my friends dog had a litter of puppies, shihtzu x terriers, the mum being the terrier. I know the mum and know she's a chill dog for the house, and the shihtzu from the dad kinda sealed the deal for me. It was also a bonus that I got to meet the puppy throughout her growth before being ready to come home with me. 

Once again I discussed this with my folks and they were fine with it, I got my little lady home and it was a instant connection for us. I can't explain it but she's just the perfect fit to the jigsaw for me. 

With the 3 dogs now, the JRT was leader among the 3, the old lil guy following second and my girl coming in last in the ""pact"", about 6 months later the lil old guy passed away peacefully in his sleep (he was 17, his former partner in crime was 18 when she passed), which left these two. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who skipped to now, I have a shihtzu and a JRT (dad adores JRT, Shihtzu is my baby) I noticed sometimes the JRT trying to block my shihtzu at times from coming near any of us, around the 10 month mark basically the JRT snarled and my shihtzu snarled back, this caused a huge fight. From then the two of them can't be seen face to face without aggression. 

We have tried everything, I even left my shihtzu down at my aunt's for 3 weeks to see if space would help them, but nope, was just the same when they were reunited. 

So here's the situation... As I said, dad adores the JRT, who is now roughly 2.5 years old, he dosnt want to part with her, he believes any dog being rehomed will never adjust to a new family like they did with their first family when they had a good family to begin with. 
It breaks my heart to think of parting with my girl, that 3 weeks she was in my aunt's house it broke me, any time I'd come down to visit, when I would leave again she'd whine all that night. And I just really missed her so much. 

The longer this is going on the more I dislike the JRT now, it's not the dogs fault I know, but I know it's not my dog for iv seen my girl out free roaming while the JRT is on a lead and my shihtzu dosnt even go near her. 

My sister is moving to a bigger home and is willing to take my girl, I'd love to see her kids get their dog after waiting so long for one, but it's just depressing me that I have to give up my perfect match of a dog. 

I was told I could get another dog in the future either a puppy or adopting, that's not an option, iv seen this JRT with other dogs, she is not good with other dogs (which I'm genuenly suprised at because I socialized both of these dogs, the JRT got to meet a lot of other dogs during puppy hood, as did the shihtzu. The shihtzu is just a bit more anxious meeting other dogs because of her expierence with the JRT, the JRT is straight up aggressive).

So now I'm just sitting here, shattered at the fact that not only am I going to have to give up my girl, but also going to have to look after the dog that made me give her up.

643,dogs,"Ok for starters this is NOT a post to anger out discussions about what is best and isn't. Do not judge others for their choices nor tell them it is bad. 
I opened this topic to also inform people what kind of diets are out there. 

So I will start. 
When I got my, now oldest, dog Zilya I started looking a lot into dogfood. I read a lot of scientific articles about the use of certain grains in dogfood that are cheap but have no value as nutrition for the dog. 
I was shocked to find my dogfood contained 27% of those grains. And all in all only 5% dehydrated meat. 
That was the moment I went over to high meat containing brands. I continued on to grain-free dogfood that did not use the bad / cheap grains. 
To continue to high meat quality grain free food. (All of these were always kibble!)
At one point I even tried cold pressed kibble but my dogs made it very clear they would not eat it. 

At this very moment we are going over, slowly, to a raw meat diet. 
And that is where I really found things change. In only 2 weeks I saw a lot of positive changes in my dogs. More energy, softer fur, better shedding.... 
I have recently bought like 30 different kinds to test out which ones my dogs like and don't like. I also bought more vegetables and fruit today for my dogs then for myself. 
So we are going to a full on raw meat diet once the last of the kibble is gone. 
(Note: I have been reading for months and talking to specialists and vets before I started feeding raw meat diet)

So, what process did you make for the diet for your dog? Did you also went through an entire try out over the years or did you find the perfect diet directly?

646,dogs,"Our dog is going to be 15 in a few months.  She‚Äôs lived a very long and storied life and is a beloved member of our family, but as she entered her golden years a few years ago she slowed down and her quality of life has greatly deteriorated , especially over the last few months.  She can barely walk, let alone do any sorts of stairs or steps.

For the past 1.5-2 years, she‚Äôs taken medication twice daily for Cushings disease as well as wearing night diapers for incontinence.  Just after Thanksgiving, she started having terrifying seizures - either from the Cushings, a brain tumor or kidney failure, which is also happening.  We thought she was going to be put down, but we didn‚Äôt have to.  So she started taking anti-seizure meds three times a day, in addition to the Cushings meds twice daily.  I also give her fluids under the skin every day with a needle and line - essentially electrolytes to help her kidneys, given to us by the vet.  She hates it and tries to bite me, but she doesn‚Äôt have many teeth left.  Then she stopped eating, so we started giving her an appetite stimulant every morning in addition to everything else, as well as custom cooking her meals and literally spoon feeding her - salmon, steak, chicken, rice etc.  She‚Äôs so disoriented and completely deaf, she gets stuck in corners a lot or wanders into the backyard and has to be found and carried back inside as she‚Äôs just staring off into the abyss.  At night, she insists on sleeping in our bed as she always has, but I wake up 5+ a night and she‚Äôs teetering on the edge of the bed or actually falls off and I have to go sleep on the sofa with her next to me in her dog bed.

The thing is, she is NOT in pain.  Maybe because of all the interventions we‚Äôre doing, who knows.  But with all the interventions and ailments, it‚Äôs getting a bit Frankenstein-ish.  She‚Äôs a shell of her former self, and definitely not living a dignified life she deserves.

654,dogs,"I posted in this sub yesterday asking for some advice on a good breed for myself as a first time-owner and based on my personal preferences/what I'm looking for in a dog. I got so many helpful and thoughtful responses, so first I want to say thanks to all those who replied - I read through all comments and really appreciated the advice!

A few people mentioned rescuing as opposed to buying a puppy from a reputable breeder (I had put on my questionnaire that I would prefer going through a breeder). After reading through comments, I wanted to ask this sub - what are your thoughts on a first time owner going through a shelter/rescue as opposed to a breeder? I know puppies are SO much work, so it is appealing to adopt an adult dog that has grown into its personality and maybe even trained to some extent.

I think my hesitancies in rescues lie in that a dog may have trauma/issues from their upbringing, and I worry I may not be able to properly address these issues. If I do adopt, my goal and plan would be to ask the organization as many questions as possible about the dog and ideally, the dog I would adopt would be with a foster, and thus able to provide me more information about temperament and personality. 

I would love to save a dog's life and am open to this, but did want to query here first to hear thoughts and opinions. I am just starting to do some research on dog ownership, and want to think about this as far ahead as I can.

Hello friends from Reddit! I am looking for a bit of more insight here and I‚Äôm thankful in advance. 

As described above, my friend Duque vomited twice on Friday at 20:00 and 23:30. On Saturday he threw up at 9:30 and 12:30. All the times it was yellow liquid, two of them with recently eaten bits of indigested sausage. 

Saturday at 13 he went to the vet, who told us he seems to have gastroenteritis. He received two shots as described above and the vet gave us prescription for Cerenia during the next 2 days starting on Sunday and Omeprazol during 5 days. 

Upon returning from the vet, Duque has not vomited at all but has drunk some water. He is lethargic and doesn‚Äôt want to eat nor play. He is still happy when someone comes home and also wants to go to the street when asked about walking. In the street, he seems happy and walks and pees normally.

657,dogs,"Hi there dog people! 

My family have been trying to rescue a dog for about a year now, and we just can't, and while it's great that so few dogs need rescuing right now, we'd still really like a dog. So we've been looking at non-rescue options. 

We've found some springer spaniel X Samoyed puppies advertised online, and, while they are super duper adorable, I've heard back yard breeding horror stories, and I don't know how to avoid us having our own bad experience. 

When so many items on the Responsible Breeder Checklist are breed specific, what questions should you be asking when looking at mixed puppies? Is the breeder's link to [this website](http://www.naturalrearing.com/coda/articles.html#landing) as much of a red flag as I think it is? The breeder says the father hasn't had any tests, but he's ""in fine health"". 

We're not planning on breeding from our dog, so if there were genetic risks to future generations, that wouldn't be such a problem, but I wouldn't want to add to someone's profits if the dogs they've bred are going to be in pain from something that should have disqualified one or both of the parents from breeding. 

Another thing that makes me curious is that in the quick look, the puppy's listing says 'no' to KC registered, but in the blurb, it says she's a 'hobby breeder' registered since 2013. I've looked on the UK Kennel Club website, and I can't find her on there, which doesn't inspire confidence. 

I would really appreciate reassurance that I'm being too cautious, or not, or any good questions to ask if we go and meet the puppies.

661,dogs,"Background: 8 y/o male papillon

My dog has been eating Taste of the Wild ""High Prairie"" dry food for most of his life. It's a blend of a number of proteins including water buffalo, venison, beef, bison, and chicken. He's always had a sensitive stomach but did OK on this food for a long time. We noticed that he was occasionally licking his paws more and more starting about \~5 months ago when he never used to. And he's had soft stools more often in recent weeks, so I started looking up sensitive stomach dog kibble to switch to (and getting away from TOTW because of the DCM issues). 

So I picked up a small bag of Hill's Sensitive Skin and Stomach chicken &amp; rice variety and did a week-long transition into that. He was a little gassy and the stools were varied throughout the week. Today was his third day on 100% Hill's and his most recent bowel movement was nothing but liquid and then he started really chewing on his hind paws for 10-15 minutes this evening. Now I'm wondering if he's sensitive to chicken and I really ratcheted things up by going to a chicken-first kibble. I went to the store and picked up some Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Stomach Salmon recipe and have that bag on standby.

So now I've got about 5 pounds each of TOTW, Hill's Chicken, and PPP Salmon but I'm not sure what my strategy should be starting with tomorrow's breakfast since he's been on Hill's for a few days now.

665,dogs,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm having a really hard time deciding what to do here so please help me out

First of all I want to explain why we had to give our dog Gofret away. 

He lived with us from 2013 to 2020. In 2020, my dad got diagnosed with allergic bronchitis and told us that he would not be able to live in the same house as Gofret anymore. 

He was also a very energetic dog who was easily excited by basically everything outdoors and pulled too hard one day while my mom was walking him and resulted in her breaking her shoulder. My mom understandably told us that she did not want to take him out again as she was scared. This was prior to my dad‚Äôs diagnosis. 

Also, both me and my sister started studying abroad. 

So, with my dad‚Äôs health issues and no one left to care for him we decided that it was too late to give him away to another family and instead wanted him to stay at a dog hotel permanently. We knew he would be taken care of because we sometimes used that place when we were going out of town etc. 

Fast forward to today, I went back to my hometown for Christmas break and asked the manager of the hotel if I could visit him. She told us that he is now very happy there and me visiting him could make him really sad and make it harder for him to get used to my absence again. 

I don‚Äôt know much about how dogs think, their sense of time and feelings but if this is really the case I don‚Äôt want to make things harder for him. 

Idk if any of this sounds selfish but I just really miss my best friend and want to see him again.

I‚Äôm hoping I could get some advice as to how to handle the great toy debacle that‚Äôs going on in my house. So I have an older, mostly deaf, blind and one eyed shih tzu named Gary who has proven to me that he‚Äôs just not good with stuffed toys and he doesn‚Äôt like harder rubber toys or ‚Äútuff toys‚Äù. I know things are different for him with toys bc he‚Äôs blind and hard of hearing, and he‚Äôs protecting himself (I guess?) but he‚Äôs growled at me for trying to even walk by him when he has a toy. I‚Äôd take it from him if he continued to do it  (and felt guiltyüò©), thinking he‚Äôd learn. But he didn‚Äôt. I stopped giving him toys. But.

I adopted a younger dog with a lot more energy and he found my ‚Äúhidden‚Äù toy basket (it‚Äôs easy to hide a toy basket from a blind dog‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt think to move it when I got a dog with vision). My new pup, Georgie, has been taking toys all over the house (I felt bad keeping them from him. It gets his energy out). But when he squeaks them, Gary can hear it and he goes nuts and starts hunting for toys (he sniffs them out easily and has found ones I didn‚Äôt even see). But if he does manage to find one, I have to take it right away.  But Georgie still wants to play with the toys Gary can‚Äôt have. They almost got into it one day over a toy. I know part of this is my problem. I just don‚Äôt know how to have playtime with the new kid without leaving out the old guy. Am I way overthinking this?

670,dogs,"My parents have two 8 year old mixed English shepherds. They are from the same litter and have been outside dogs their whole lives. We have utterly failed to train them and they are not veryobedient, though both are generally good natured. I and most of my siblings have moved out so there are not a lot of people to give them attention. Furthermore, my parents are trying to sell their house and are having a lot of difficulty finding a new house that would allow them to bring the dogs. 

So we have to find them a new home very soon. My dad is very concerned with finding them a good home, as he feels bad that we've never trained them and they can't take them with. He is willing to pay for a new owner to have them trained, but doesn't know how to find someone who would want them. We do not want to take them to a shelter or rescue, nor does he want to just give them away without a reasonable assurance that they'll be treated well. But for someone who genuinely wants them and will treat them well we would travel and/or pay for training to make it work. 

They are up to date on their shots and both are neutered. Storm is tri colored, black with white and tan markings, 62lbs. Sam is tan with white markings, 80lbs. We are getting a DNA test done for them both to find out their parentage more exactly. I am trying to get some pictures from my parents now.

678,dogs,"Cross-posted from r/dogtraining

I have a 2.5 y/o TWC mix (rescue). His insanely nose driven nature makes him very difficult to walk. We've made progress (walking him a lot has made them less ""exciting"" I think so he isn't 110% go go go all the time) but it feels like we have hit a wall. I've tried a few different methods but it's hard to find something that even seems to work with him, let alone stay consistent enough to get real results. I love him to bits and really want to be able to go on long walks with him.

Most methods ive seen involve getting your dog to focus on you, and i think that is where we are having trouble. He does NOT care about treats when we are out and about, so trying to use them to get his focus doesn't work(also very clumsy trying to fumble them around as he is actively pulling me). Using other stimuli like a buzzer that gets his attention at home barely makes him break stride out on the street. I'm at a bit of a loss on how to get him to focus. 

As far as equipment. I've tried allllll kinds. Gentle Leader seems to work the best, but if there's something he really wants at, he knows how to turn his head a certain way and still be able to pull. He also hates the gentle leader and tries to rip it off frequently (I've adjusted it and made sure it fits correctly, even tried it with different levels of snug-ness, he still tries to rip it off). If I walk him with a harness and leash, but the gentle leader is on and not connected to anything, he leaves it alone. So my running theory is he hates the gentle leader because it doesn't let him pull as much. 

He's also very strong. I can handle him most of the time but every now and then he catches me off guard and pulls me around good. I'm actually lifting weights and exercising to try and be able to handle him better lol. 

The best walks we have are actually runs, funny enough. It's like when he's running he doesn't have time to care about all the passing smells and just goes onward. Too bad we can't run 100% of the time.

684,dogs,"Me and my dog Betty (9) have a very close relationship. She‚Äôs extremely sensitive and I believe we communicate in a way I can‚Äôt really explain. She has helped me through mental health difficulties and is just generally a beautiful animal who I adore. 

While I was at university I obviously couldn‚Äôt take her with me so for 4 years she lived with my dad. I would come back to visit often but always found it heartbreaking walking out of the door and seeing her little face, wondering when I‚Äôm coming back. 

I moved home after university but have to move out again for my job and I can‚Äôt take her with me due to my hours. My dad takes basic care of her- food, walks etc - and she is fond of him, they get on, but he isn‚Äôt very affectionate at all and doesn‚Äôt cuddle her much or give her much love. Definitely doesn‚Äôt talk to her, play with her, or engage in the same intimate way I do. 

I am so worried about leaving her and just feel so sad and anxious about how she will feel when I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôm not far away so plan to visit fortnightly or take her to my new flat some weekends. I‚Äôm also going to try and arrange a younger dog walker who can potentially build a bit of a relationship with her while I‚Äôm gone. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any info / advice on this subject as the thought of leaving her is breaking my heart. E.g. - is there anything I can do to make the transition more comfortable for her? Am I overthinking it and she‚Äôll be okay with my dad? Will she miss me? I love her so much and just want her to be happy and healthy.

685,dogs,"Hello- firstly sorry as I originally posted this in the Newfoundland forum, but wondered if that was the best place as presumably those members mainly have experience with Newfies.. and it didn‚Äôt generate any response so hope it‚Äôs ok to repost! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I had two Newfies (one cross) growing up and to say they were the love of my life would be an understatement the second one in particular seem to literally be able to read my mind, and I remember once sitting in the kitchen crying about some teenage drama and thinking ‚ÄòI really need a hug‚Äô.. at which point he literally stood up, walked over and lay his head in my lap. Truly an angel!

I know I cannot expect all Newfies to behave in this way (or to live up to those expectations!) but, moreover, I‚Äôm also in the reality where I have a very house proud husband who does the majority of the cleaning and - whilst being a dog lover - has put a strict ban on allowing a Newfie to join our home üò©. It‚Äôs been 7 years and I‚Äôve still not convinced him it‚Äôs manageable and we are a partnership! We DO however have a very sweet 12 year old tibetan terrier and have recently moved from the city to the countryside where we have a decent fenced garden, live literally across from giant woodland and 20 minute drive from the beach. 

We have a 5 year old daughter and I also have two stepdaughters (age 10,11) - all of whom are respectful and adoring of animals , with the caveat that the older one has additional needs (Down‚Äôs syndrome, so no hyperactivity or challenging behaviour but some clumsiness and I know she‚Äôd really value a canine friend ‚ò∫Ô∏è). We also have 2 cats. My partner and I do a mix of office work and work from home so there is basically always someone at home. I do long walks daily and am fairly active (but the dog obviously doesn‚Äôt have to do ALL of that with me!)

We have now decided that in the next year or so we will get a second (large/ giant) dog and I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has any views on the breed most similar to Newfies but perhaps a little easier on the house-proud (ideally short coated I guess?). My husband isn‚Äôt completely militant about it- he just grew up with labs so he knows the drill with swimmy heavy shedders.. and we also live in area where it‚Äôs muddy about 70% if the year üòî

I had thought of a Dane but I‚Äôve never really known any.. and I don‚Äôt know if they have quite the soul of a Newfie? My husband is very partial to Rottweilers - and we do have some good previous experience of dogs and understanding of training- but the kids do have quite a few play dates at the house and I‚Äôve heard even well socialised rotties can be stressed by homes with frequent visitors?

695,dogs,"Hello, fellow dog owners! 

My 11-year-old German Shepherd recently started having minor bouts of non-productive dry heaving, occurring¬†1-2 times a day and each lasting no more than 3 seconds.¬† He's had occasional¬†abdominal breathing at rest and will sometimes let out a brief yelp when he lays down. No other symptoms and an otherwise clean medical history. I brought him to the vet who suspected a pleural effusion due to being unable to auscultate heart sounds on the right side. Lung sounds were clear. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of the excess fluid and a thoracocentesis was performed, draining 1.2 liters of bloody fluid from the chest cavity. During prep for the chest tap, my dog's long fur was shaved which revealed a prominent mass near his spleen. As such, the hypothesized diagnosis given was hemangiosarcoma.¬† ¬†   
    
The vet thinks I should begin end of life care, and to strongly consider euthanizing my dog within the next few days. I am positing¬†here to see what my options are. The vet estimates, though she admits that she isn't completely certain, that the surgery to remove the mass will cost at minimum $8k. When I search the web for estimated costs for a splenectomy, most sources quote $2k to $4k. For those who have had the surgery, what has the cost been? I am located in a major city in the Northeast.¬†    
  
When I researched the life expectancy for hemangiosarcoma, it was not good -- 3 to 6 weeks if surgery is elected, and a possible 6 months if put on chemo afterwards. To me, $3k is doable and would be worth the extra weeks. But approaching $10k would cripple me financially. Unfortunately, I do not have pet insurance.¬†For those who elected for the surgery, what was the outcome? Do you have any regrets? 

My dog is currently doing okay. There are moments of increased respiratory effort, and at times he can be restless at night. But they don't last long. No obvious signs of pain and no other symptoms as far as I know.    
  
It feels so wrong to put him down when his demeanor has been pretty good. It does not feel like he should be receiving end of life care. He's playing, he's eating (loving the increased steak and chicken bits), and he's responsive. But I understand that this is the grim reality of hemangiosarcoma, if that is what is causing these issues. Which brings me to my next point -- what are the chances that the mass is benign?¬†Is that just wishful thinking on my part?   

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this! It would be greatly appreciated, as I am currently at a loss for what to do. He is my first dog, and I've been fortunate enough that this is first time I've had to deal with the possibility of losing someone in my life who I love dearly.¬†",t2_nyp5q,0,"Possible hemangiosarcoma, what are my options?","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,105ym46,True,fauxdoc,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/105ym46/possible_hemangiosarcoma_what_are_my_options/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/105ym46/possible_hemangiosarcoma_what_are_my_options/,2479785,1673122894,0,,False,1673122907,1673122908,2023-01-07 20:21:34,,,,,

701,dogs,"Hi! I know there are probably many posts like this but I can‚Äôt find much information on the licking part when I googled, there are plenty on biting but I‚Äôd also like advice on that as well.

I have a dog that is about a year old and he has some behavioral issues that are most likely our fault from lack of socialization with other dogs and people and maybe also breed but we really don‚Äôt want to blame it on breed as we probably should have done more when he was younger.

First off for the licking:

We have been training him for a year now and he is responsive to simple things like sit, lay down, gentle (when accepting treats or toys), and other small commands. He is very excitable and playful and has pretty much unlimited energy as he is a Australian Shepard/cattle dog mix.

Whenever we tell our dog to not do something or even to sit or anything really he will lick his genitals. It‚Äôs something that I refer to as a tick? Like automatically after we say something or tell him no he does it. I will say he is stubborn and he doesn‚Äôt really like doing the tasks we make him do, but I think that‚Äôs just apart of his personality at this point. We are still continuing to train him on commands at home and we are considering hiring a trainer as well (saving money) because he needs dramatic help with socialization (our fault), but the most urgent issue we have is biting.

Our dog since he was a pup has been a biter, we don‚Äôt encourage it AT ALL, and never have. We have never put our hands in his mouth purposely or tried to teach him to bite, but he is a VERY bitey dog. To the point where he has hurt me, and crying out or pretending to be hurt and ignoring him doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs the BIGGEST reason why we believe we require a trainer. He also is not very good around children or elderly, he has gotten very aggressive with my partners grandfather, and actually has lunged at a delivery man. We believe with is grandfather it was because of the smell of his own dog, but we have no idea about the delivery man. When he meets our friends he immediately begins going for their hands, and honestly it‚Äôs the reason why we don‚Äôt have many people over.

He only truly respects my partner and at one point he lunged at me while we were playing. It makes me feel sad because I love him a lot, but he really is and odd ball dog. I really do think that a part of this has to do with his breed (the biteyness) but no matter what we do to show him it‚Äôs not ok‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt work I have even tried putting bitter spray on my hands.

He‚Äôs also really smart? Like potty training him was super easy and he loves his crate like he doesn‚Äôt view it as a punishment and enjoys going to bed at night. We crate trained him because we knew we were going to need to leave home at some points and he has done an excellent job with it. At night he goes in his cage sometimes without me even saying anything and I thought that maybe by teaching him his crate is a safe space it would alleviate anxiety but I don‚Äôt think I has.

The funny part of this all is he‚Äôs great with our cats, loves them, and is pretty gentle overall with them. He‚Äôs a sweet dog when you get to know him, and when introduced properly to others is very kind, playful, and affectionate. He has never liked being pet on the head tho so we avoid head pets and only really pet his body.

I think he just feels tremendously anxious? I just don‚Äôt know what to do to help him feel less an anxious and most of all to stop the need for the biting? Is this just something I should stop waiting on and forget continuing to train at home and call in a trainer immediately to help with? Or is there something I can start working with him on now without a trainer?

Sorry this was so long‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm looking for any kind of advice, videos, podcasts? thank you!

705,dogs,"I have a roughly 2.5 year old high-energy rescued boxer/pit/vizsla/beagle/etc mix. She‚Äôs shy with people (likely genetic because the whole litter was, despite being rescued and fostered young), but otherwise has a great temperament and almost universally loves other dogs. In fact, the only occasions she regularly barks at other dogs is when she is walking on a leash and can‚Äôt run over and say hi to them. She‚Äôs never aggressive and very deferential and playful - in fact, my dog walker says she‚Äôs her easiest client.  Most days I walk her off leash on hiking trails, and she will greet any dog we see politely, play with those who want to play, and move on from those who don‚Äôt. 

Except this morning she randomly went off on another dog, with no provocation that I could see. Really aggressive barking, showing teeth, etc., though not actually attacking him. The other dog (larger and older than her) was basically cowering, and I had to take her by the collar and remove her. She went right back to normal, but I was embarrassed and shaken and felt terrible for the poor dog.

Sorry if this question does not fit this sub. But I have a mixed breed I rescued and would like to know more about its genetics. I purchased an Embark DNA test kit for my dog and have a stupid question about the instructions for anyone who is familiar with this test kit.


The instructions say to wait 30 minutes after eating to swab. Does that mean I should swab after 30 minutes of eating, or does it mean I need to wait at least 30 minutes after eating to swab? My dog ate 3 hours ago. Can I still swab or should I wait until I give her dinner, and swab 30 minutes after she eats it?

I might add that I‚Äôve also always been drawn towards high energy dogs and particularly dogs with ‚Äúpointy ears‚Äù and particularly spitz breeds (when I was a younger teen I was also obsessed with GSDs).

She has 6 weeks old puppies of bohemian shepherds and she has had a few litters over the years and this is the first time her puppies are fighting even at such young age.

She has them separated and punishes the bigger puppies when they antagonize the smaller one. Their mother doesn‚Äôt correct them. But they don‚Äôt stop is the thing. Do you have experience in that?

727,dogs,"Hello,

About a month and a half ago my mom adopted an English Cocker Spaniel puppy who she named JiminShi (yes, after one of the BTS guys, she‚Äôs a big fan) after our 17 year old dachshund Manolo passed away in October. About three months ago JiminShi came to live permanently with my sister and I, who already had another 10 year old cocker named Tommy, and two cats. JiminShi and Tommy have gotten along GREAT, they play together, Tommy has taught JiminShi how to behave and JiminShi has rekindled Tommy‚Äôs playfulness after many years of not playing much with Manolo because of his old age. JiminShi is a very well behaved puppy and loves to say hi and play with other dogs. 

However, we live near one of the only doggy parks in my city, and that‚Äôs where the small problem lies. Whenever we‚Äôve taken the boys there JiminShi gets intimidated when there‚Äôs already many dogs playing. He‚Äôs great with one on one play, but if there‚Äôs three or more dogs playing you can see he wants to join in, but he doesn‚Äôt know how. He sniffs their butt from behind, he does the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play pose‚Äù, he kind of walks around the playing dogs, but if the group gets too close he runs a lap and stays at a distance. Tommy isn‚Äôt a great help here because he‚Äôs always preferred playing fetch over playing with other dogs. 

He‚Äôs only been with us for 3 weeks and some days, and it‚Äôs not a huge issue, but I do want him to feel confident and be able to play with the big boys and girls.

734,dogs,"Hello all,

My two terrors and I recently moved into a new house and they do *not* seem to be able to cope with rules about peeing and pooing. Our previous home was a tiny flat (literally one room with a balcony) on a very high floor. One of my dogs always used a pee pad in the corner for both pees and poos, while the other would wait by the balcony door to be let out to do his business. 

Our new places is huge -- three floors, including a basement -- and the kids seem totally confused about where poos and pees are acceptable. The one who uses the pee pad is more or less ok, but the boy poos and pees in random places and won't necessarily go when I let him out into the garden.

Does anyone have any advice on how to re-train the two? Pet tax in the comments.

748,dogs,"Hi all,

I had a rough start when adopting my rescue girl (2 yo mid size) 6 months ago. She was seemingly tramuatized after being found pregnant in a trailer park and avoided other dogs and people. 

She trusts me and my family now so she tolerates petting, has shown more of her personality, and is wanting to play more. 

After the initial hard adjustment, it's very nice seeing her act more like a typical dog but her play is way too rough for me. She loves to chew and so she'll nip and jump at us in a way that would be cute if it didn't hurt so much (leaves us with bruises).

To divert her biting, I'll give her a bully stick and she'll switch targets usually. When she doesn't, I have to put my foot down and tell her no but 1) it doesn't stop her for long and 2) I feel bad trying to put a stop to her having fun.

I think part of it has to do with some cooped up energy because we don't go on long walks. However we don't do that because she still get incredinly anxious outside/around people, she actually shakes and will try to run away to the point she will pull the leash out of my hands.

I'm going to try to take her on more walks, but I am apprehensive.

My previous dog was a German Shepherd mix.  She lived to 16 and passed away \~1 year ago.  I am ready to get another dog.   I'm hoping to get some ideas about breeds that might be a good match for me. 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* I have owned multiple dogs, one as an adult.   I have trained them, but don't consider myself an expert at training.  I am happy to take the time to read/learn more about training.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  \* I am open to either, but would prefer rescuing. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Ideally I'd like a friendly dog who gets along with the vast majority of other people and other dogs, with little risk of physically hurting others.   I'd like an athletic dog that can keep up with me on multi-day hikes with \~10 miles per day -- agile, able to run fast, with good endurance.   I'd like to be able to take the dog to the park and play fetch.   I'd prefer a dog that's easier to train (especially bathroom training), has little grooming needs, easy to clean when wet/muddy, and little health needs -- generally low maintenance.  I'd prefer lower health needs both as a puppy and as a senior dog.   I'd prefer a dog with a unique appearance and background, a one-of-a-kind dog.   I sometimes find dogs with lots of colors (especially merle) and softer coats as having an especially appealing appearance.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \*  I am not especially familiar with most dog breeds, particularly the less common ones.  I'm hoping to get some ideas about breeds I hadn't thought of from the responses.   Mixed breed is also great.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* Basic training commands, with some minor additions as needed for specific situations within my household and life.   One unique need is letting me know when someone is at the door since I have severe hearing loss.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* No  

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* I work from home and have a lot of free time -- hours every day.  This relates to why I'm interested in getting a dog now.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* Walk around the neighborhood hours each day.   Go to dog parks regularly.   On weekends go on a long hike.  Once in a while long car trip to full day hike or multi-day hike.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I'd prefer minimal grooming, but not a dealbreaker.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Medium to large -- Big enough to accompany me on long hiking trips and feel safe when interacting with larger dogs at the dog park, but not so big that I cannot lift or would increase risk of health issues.   40-75lb or so.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Prefer less shedding and slobber.  I have a good tolerance to barking with the hearing loss noted earlier, but less barking is better.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* This is important to me.   I'd like to be able to play in area parks with other neighborhood dogs, some of which are not fenced.

 \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* Either is okay.  No strong preference.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I'd like the dog to let me know that someone is at the door, without acting threatening to visitors.    

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* I am willing to train a dog to help improve aggressive behavior.  However, friendly and safe interactions with other dogs is important to me.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* Some behaviors I'd prefer to avoid/minimize include physical harming myself, other persons, or other dogs.  If my gardener opens the gate to my backyard while my dog is inside, I do not want the gardener to be physically harmed.   I'd prefer to minimize destructive behavior in the home, such as chewing furniture, baseboards, doors, etc.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* I work from home, so not often.  Most days, never left alone in home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* No other people in house.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* No/None

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?   24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* I live in a very moderate climate, within the USA.   Typical summer high is 73F.  Typical winter temp near sunset (last walk) is 55F.  My home insurance restricts some breeds associated with a higher rate of biting injuries, such as pitbull and doberman.",t2_13u0sj,0,Please Suggest Dog Breeds for Me,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üìùRecommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üìùRecommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,105k7rb,True,TheSnorlaxSquad,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/105k7rb/please_suggest_dog_breeds_for_me/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/105k7rb/please_suggest_dog_breeds_for_me/,2479608,1673080810,0,,False,1673080822,1673080823,2023-01-07 08:40:10,,,,,

I have a 15 year old medium sized dog.  Lately he  needs to urinate more than before and therefore 1-2 times a day when I can't take him out he pees on the balcony near a column. I noticed that the pee corrodes the tiles and the iron parts of the column. 

How can I proceed to resolve this situation?  I was thinking of putting a cage around the column to prevent access to it, and buying a toilet like this https://amzn.eu/d/e2xiBWQ or this one https://amzn.eu/d/0zjAEUl .

If it‚Äôs in a busy kitchen you may want to try a quieter location or vice versa. If there‚Äôs another animal in the house might try separating them And giving them  plenty of alone time at feedings.  Are you or another family member, particularly young children, adding to the stress of eating?

I‚Äôve lived on a ranch with more than a dozen dogs at any single time and have helped others with behavioral issues including eating extreme.  Personally I would discount all the special preparation, food temperature, toppers etc advice.  I have never had a dog that was not a free feeder, including breeds that are ‚Äúknown‚Äù for picky or voracious habits.  Unless there is an underlying health issue, 99% of feeding issues are owner errors.  You will not starve your animal and they will eat when they are hungry enough.

771,dogs,"Hi everyone

Have a 3 year old yorkie poodle. 13 lbs.

Switched to homecooking a year ago as she was a very picky and finnicky eater.

Use this below recipe except i do 2 lbs turkey, 1 lb beef , 5 cups rice, 5 eggs, 16 oz  peas carrots mix and 8 oz broccoli or green beans(alternate each make), rest i keep same as in link

https://thismessisours.com/home-made-dog-food-recipe-for-the-holidays/

The recipe above reccomended dog greens but for some reason i went with pet wholistics, canine complete.

Over the course of the year i did notice harpey gained a lb from 12 to 13 lbs and her fur color changed from pure white to have alot more beige in it. She is also less active a bit but otherwise seems normal.

I recently decided to relook at the nutritional aspect and noticed the pet wholistics canine complete is missing alot of important vitamins. This made me question if i am giving her the correct nutrotional boost that she needa with home cooking.

Any experts can help me out? Seems like both products offer some similar and different vitamins/minerals/amino acids/microorganisms/etc.

Should i be giving her both potentially or is one more suitable than the other?

Im thinking of maybe switching her to dog greens for the added vitamins, esp since she eats alot of veggies so she doesnt need a ton of fiber which pet wholiatics seems to have more of.

Would appreciate any and all advice.

Thank you.

I am not sure if this is something I should immediately make a Vet appointment for and look into further (which is what I am probably going to do) I am just freaking out a bit bc my dog is all I have in this world and I will do whatever it takes to help him be healthy and happy. 

I am turning to Reddit bc it‚Äôs Friday night at 9 and I need to calm down and make a plan. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if I am posting in the wrong subreddit please tell me where to post. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the length but I‚Äôm copying and pasting the email directly. Cliff notes at the bottom. 

Here is the email:

My name is Dr. Kari Cueva, and I am a Veterinary Geneticist on the Embark team. As a clinical veterinarian, I understand how important our genetic health testing is to the well being of Theodore P. Chatburn. I know that you have been awaiting Theodore P. Chatburn's health results, and I can assure you that they are about to be finalized.

I am reaching out to you today to let you know that while Theodore P. Chatburn does not have risk from most of the genetic variants that we test for, he does have genetic variants associated with the following health condition: Chondrodystrophy and Intervertebral Disc Disease, CDDY/IVDD, Type I IVDD. Please keep in mind while reading these results that this is not a medical diagnosis. We recommend you provide Theodore P. Chatburn‚Äôs Embark results to your veterinarian. Theodore P. Chatburn's full health results will be available in their profile within 48 hours, where you can email, download, or print Theodore P. Chatburn's Veterinary Report.

Chondrodystrophy and Intervertebral Disc Disease, CDDY/IVDD, Type I IVDD
Theodore P. Chatburn has 1 copy of a risk variant associated with this condition.

What does this result mean?
Our research indicates that this genetic variant is likely to increase the risk that Theodore P. Chatburn will develop this disease.

What is Chondrodystrophy and Intervertebral Disc Disease, CDDY/IVDD, Type I IVDD?
Type I Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is a back/spine issue that refers to a health condition affecting the discs that act as cushions between vertebrae. With Type I IVDD, affected dogs can have a disc event where it ruptures or herniates towards the spinal cord. This pressure on the spinal cord causes neurologic signs which can range from a wobbly gait to impairment of movement. Chondrodystrophy (CDDY) refers to the relative proportion between a dog‚Äôs legs and body, wherein the legs are shorter and the body longer. There are multiple different variants that can cause a markedly chondrodystrophic appearance as observed in Dachshunds and Corgis. However, this particular variant is the only one known to also increase the risk for IVDD.

How do I know if my dog will develop this health condition?
Research indicates that dogs with one or two copies of this variant have a similar risk of developing IVDD. However, there are some breeds (e.g. Beagles and Cocker Spaniels, among others) where this variant has been passed down to nearly all dogs of the breed and most do not show overt clinical signs of the disorder. This suggests that there are other genetic and environmental factors (such as weight, mobility, and family history) that contribute to an individual dog‚Äôs risk of developing clinical IVDD. Signs of IVDD include neck or back pain, a change in your dog's walking pattern (including dragging of the hind limbs), and paralysis. These signs can be mild to severe, and if your dog starts exhibiting these signs, you should schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for a diagnosis.



CLIFF NOTES:
DNA/GENETIC TEST shows my dog has 1 copy of a risk variant associated with this condition is at high risk for Chondrodystrophy and Intervertebral Disc Disease, CDDY/IVDD, Type I IVDD

778,dogs,"Hi, 

I have adopted a rescue dog from Romania, and he is overall a very sweet dog, but I have some problems with the bonding and obedience between us. 

His personality used to be very calm, also in the videos from his previous environment, and I think he was just depressed or less confident before. Now he seems to have a lot more energy, and he is very independent, and won‚Äôt listen to me as much. He is very insistent when he wants to do something so it feels very much like we‚Äôre butting heads often. I noticed that he‚Äôs like that with other dogs as well. 

He‚Äôs not aggressive at all, but when he sees that someone doesn‚Äôt want to interact, dogs included, he doesn‚Äôt back away, he just keeps doing the same things. 
I guess he doesn‚Äôt really respect boundaries?

His age is around 1,5 and he is a larger breed. He has some husky in him quite possibly from the markings, but he is a mixed breed. I did a dna test for him but I haven‚Äôt had the results yet. 

Today, out of nowhere, while he was playing the sniffing game, where I hide treats for him and he sniffs them out, he just peed on the carpet right in our sleeping area. 
He generally doesn‚Äôt have accidents so it was quite strange. Can dogs pee from a sense of accomplishment? I had hidden the treat somewhere rather hard to find? 

His other problems are wanting to run up to dogs and being really fixated, again not aggressive, but really fixated and pulling. I‚Äôve tried different things with it. He has met a lot of dogs at the dog park, and initially I introduced him to some dogs while on walks as well, but it didn‚Äôt get better so I thought maybe it‚Äôs better if he understands that normal walks are not for dog meetings. 

So all in all, I‚Äôm having to be very disciplined with him, but it‚Äôs also having a bit of an effect on our relationship because I feel like I‚Äôm kind party pooping his whole vibe, and that he doesn‚Äôt like or love me. I‚Äôve also gotten angry at times, and it‚Äôs going into negative training direction but he is SO strong headed that he doesn‚Äôt really listen unless he feels there is a reason to (treats work only to a point). I‚Äôm also feeling less into him at the moment, because it feels like a lot of work, and also that ultimately, he‚Äôs not happy. 

In terms of energy and exercise, I do take him on bike rides, and try to do training regularly for mental stimulation. He does well, he learned to sit within a few days, he has a really good stay, when he‚Äôs not pushing boundaries. 

As an example, after he settled a little, he had a problem with me not wanting him on the bed, and he wouldn‚Äôt stop trying to get on, no matter what I did, if I pushed him away, if I left the room, nothing worked. As soon as I entered the room, and went to the bed, he was trying to get on. In the end, the method I used was showing him the lighter (he is spooked out by lighters) and that‚Äôs the only way he actually stopped trying and eventually respected that boundary. He doesn‚Äôt try to go on the bed now. 

If somebody doesn‚Äôt want to pet him, he will be in their face, pushing his head in, jumping up (not that much because I don‚Äôt let him but he would if he could). He also sometimes starts to bite at me to keep stroking him when I stop, and I‚Äôve had to now resort to physically responding to it, with an unpleasant physical response, so he actually stops. 

In the dog park, he will play fight to figure out hierarchy, and then even after he has submitted, like licked the older male dogs face and lied down on his back, he will still go back and try the same things again and again to the point where the other older dog, who just want to sniff around at this point, starts to get more aggressive. At which point obviously I step in. He is, or was, actually well socialised, he gets on with dogs, he‚Äôs just super insistent on not following rules. Human or canine. I don‚Äôt like being the though guy, or woman in this case, and I know all the stuff about being a calm assertive leader and all that, but this boy is needing some stronger assertion than it takes me to be calm. 

Another small example, if anybody will bother to read all this, I tell him to sit, open the door, and I want him to stay, he will, and then suddenly he‚Äôll try to run through the doorway. Not every time, other times he can do it fine and well. In that moment, I feel like ‚Äòhe can‚Äôt just disobey me straight to my face like that‚Äô, so I grab him and I physically push him back into the room. Then he goes for it again, and I grab him and push him back again, and after a few times where I‚Äôve had to really exert some effort, finally, he will stop trying and actually stay away from the space I‚Äôm claiming. 

I‚Äôm just having to have such a firm hand with him. 

Is this normal? Is he still just in his adolescent phase? 

Does he love me? Is he happy? Is this a sign that he‚Äôs being a normal dog in this stage of his development? 

I feel like I have a teenager.

780,dogs,"Hi guys,

Bella : 9yo, 26lbs Corgi, neutered.

I noticed a small hard lump on the lower-left ribcage area on my Bella this week and got her in the vet right away. The vet almost couldn't find it, i had to put her hand on the area for her to find it. Which i thought was a positive sign that I'm just freaking out for no reason. Vet asked me if I want to do an X-ray and a full panel testing if I'm worried, so I said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

$700 and an hour later, I got Bella back without a clear diagnosis. She told me there is some irregularities on the X-ray, she noticed some bronchial changes with possible tracheal narrowing, but she'd like to have another vet to look at it on Monday before giving her opinion. The full panel test will take another few days or so as well. She sent me home with the note during Bella's session, which has ""Bone lesion vs benign"" written amongst others. When I asked her if she can give me her first initial opinion based on the X-ray, she said ""if it's nothing to be worried about, I would have told you that and wouldn't need for 2nd opinion from another vet. That's all I can say for now"" (????!!!!????!!!) So right now I'm in limbo with some ""not-official-but-very-scary"" diagnosis from the vet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bella's fine. Drinking, eating, walking, pooping well. She's getting extra loves for the time being. To help with her tracheal, I swapped out her collar to a harness during walk and honestly she's more annoyed at that change more than anything. But I know she can't tell me that she's in pain. I did some google search on ""bone lesion"" and I am freaking out. It seems that bone lesion = bone cancer = 6-1 year left. Is she in pain? Has she been in pain for long? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know i need to wait for the official diagnosis and recommendation for next steps, but I'm scared. I've had her since she was 8 WEEKS old. I got her to thin out from 34lbs to 26lbs (in 3 years) and she's the healthiest she's ever been! Very food driven and very active on walks. And now I'm unsure how long we have left together. I'm holding my breathe for the worst now... and I have to wait until at LEAST Monday, maybe longer.

He is my mother's dog, and I have just moved back into her house a week ago. I've never lived with the dog before. 


The dog is very sweet. He likes me very much. He responds to commands, plays fetch, cuddles with me on the couch etc. He has some problems with pulling on the leash and begging for food, but he's very nice otherwise and good with strangers and strange dogs. 


However he has these random outbursts of aggression towards me and I'm not sure why. It's only happened once or twice, and there is very little warning. 


It's not about food or anything, and there's no defensive behavior prior to the outbursts. Just randomly 3-4 times he's suddenly just started barking and growling and going after me. Twice I've even been across the room when it happened.

784,dogs,"I just moved to a new neighborhood in a new state with my partner and our dogs. Tonight while out walking our dogs we saw a little teacup terrier running around, and so my partner went to help him while I held our dogs. It was very cold out, there‚Äôs a construction site behind our row of homes, and the poor dog was shivering and scared, running among the debris and machinery. My partner coaxes him over and picks him up, and the dog has no tags on him. My partner swears he‚Äôs seen this dog out wandering before, and that he must be local to our street. We knock on some doors and at one house, we can tell someone is home but they don‚Äôt come to the door for about five minutes, finally the door opens and a teenager just says, oh yeah we were waiting for him to come back. Takes the dog and shuts the door. My partner is thrown, they didn‚Äôt seem to care at all and he‚Äôs definitely seen the dog wandering at least 2x before. So we ask one of our other neighbors who we‚Äôve befriended if they‚Äôve seen the dog wandering, and they tell us that it‚Äôs super sad but yes, everyone knows this dog. His family refuses to walk him, instead they put him outside with no tags, no leash, in every type of weather, and just leave him out there for awhile. We live on a main road, it‚Äôs winter, and this is a teacup sized dog exposed to the elements, cars, hawks, foxes, and construction every single day on his own. Apparently many neighbors have found and returned the dog but the owners do not care and will not change, and the dog has been seen wandering the street late at night. What are my best options? I‚Äôm planning to call Animal Control tomorrow anonymously for advice, but I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôre not going to do anything. If I see him wandering again, should I take him to a shelter?

This is all very unlike my dog who hasn't peed in the house since she was a puppy (less than 1 year old).

She doesn't smell bad, which I thought a sign of a UTI. She is always licking as she has major allergies. My dog is very healthy otherwise - running around, happy and energetic and eating her meals.

The only other thing that is different is that my caboodle was in a traumatic event 3 months ago. She was mauled by two large dogs.

790,dogs,"My dog who died was a 5 year old rescue whippet ray terrier mix. He was frightened of men and loud voices the minute we got him, did not understand any commands, reminded me a little of Santa‚Äôs little helper on the Simpsons. He was fast but not so smart. 

A year ago we got a boy and girl gsd from different litters. They were both about 12 weeks when we got them. Our rescue growled at them all the time. The female was usually overbearing with kisses while he growled. The male gsd dealt with the growling and did play with him in the yard. They would run around the yard, I do think at the lines our rescue would nip a little extra hard when playing but I looked it over and didn‚Äôt worry for the increasingly growing male gsd. 

I don‚Äôt know if this makes a difference, the male gsd is intact, the female fixed, and the rescue whippet fixed. 

We recently bought another gsd from the same line as the male, he is currently 16 weeks. The 2 males seems to get along fine and sleep next to each other more times than not. 


The incident: the whippet wanted to go inside and was standing by the door, the older male gsd was standing by him in a non threatening way, suddenly the whippet growled and showed his teeth. It got tense fast. I told the gsd to back off but he wouldn‚Äôt listen to the command in the heat of the moment. They both had stiff bodies which I understood to break it up if I could. The puppy had started barking about 10 feet away in their direction and like a firecracker the gsd got grip and wouldn‚Äôt let go. The female gsd took side of the male gsd and helped him in the fight. The puppy was scared barking in the background. As the only adult there I attempted to grab the gsds harness , it was too much, the whippet bit my hand in the process and I started draining like a faucet. The 2 gsds on the one whippet lasted 5 minutes I felt so helpless as I went for the garden hose. I hooked it up and sprayed them. That worked. But it was too late. Im heart broken, but more so I don‚Äôt want an incident to happen to the 2 male gsds. It‚Äôs important to note again the whippet never accepted the older gsd male or the female for that matter. Perhaps because he was seniority. I know I probably make a ton of mistakes, and I‚Äôm going to get better.

798,dogs," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Over my life I‚Äôve had a Cairn Terrier (responsible for care not training as I was a child), a Maltese (care and training) and a Pomeranian (Care and Training)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* 30-90 pounds, great with children, naturally protective, mellow with low-moderate exercise requirements, minimal shedding

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Cattle Dog, smart, loyal, healthy, perfect size; Bouvier Des Flandres, strong, affectionate, protective, minimal shedding, healthy; Shar Pei, mellow, protective

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Sit, Stay, Lay down, fetch, protect/follow, heel

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No experience with a working dog, not interested in sport or hunting/herding

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-3 hours

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1 hour of low-moderate activity like playing in the yard, walks around the neighborhood. My dog wouldn‚Äôt be sedentary but I know that if one requires a two mile run each day, I would not reliably be able to satisfy that need, and the subsequent destruction of the house would be unfair to him/her. I want to avoid that and get something that isn‚Äôt super energetic. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* i would be willing to brush weekly, trim nails and clean ears. I‚Äôd be happy to pay for it as well. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 30-90 pounds, I know that‚Äôs a large gap, but I want something bigger than a lap dog but small enough I can pick him up and fit him in cars comfortably 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* minimal shedding, low-moderate drool, and barking to alert is fine but my Maltese were incessant barkers and I don‚Äôt want that with sleeping babies/toddlers in the home. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* no preference, if I can great, but if not that‚Äôs okay with me. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* i understand dogs show love in different ways and I‚Äôm open to appreciate any type of affectionate displays. From licks to just being in the same room. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* either/or, I whether they‚Äôre all about me or just enjoy the company of our family, I respect and appreciate it either way. If this is speaking to trainability, then I would prefer eager to please to simplify training, but I don‚Äôt mind some independence. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* vigilance, not hostility per se but I‚Äôd like him/her to be protective as opposed to completely indifferent to strangers. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* i intent to socialize him/her often. My office is very dog friendly, usually 2-4 dogs at any time. They‚Äôre all extremely well behaved so from day 1 I intend to socialize him/her there as well as to public areas like Lowe‚Äôs or dog parks. If I am unable to assuage the dog-aggressiveness, I don‚Äôt mind it too much. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* aggression toward children, constant barking

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* almost never, my office has 2-4 dogs present at any given time and mine will accompany me almost daily. In the event I can‚Äôt bring him/her, my wife is a stay at home mom and will be there with the dog. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* my wife is adamant shedding is problematic. Some hair is to be expected but minimal. Safe and gentle with the toddler and (soon to be) baby. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* no other pets or plans to get more 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* yes, daily

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* no, own my current home

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Alaska, no bans on breeds 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 60 to 80, Winter -10 to 10

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have a medium sized yard that the dog would be free to access 24/7, and it will get plenty of attention and play. I‚Äôm just not looking for a super energetic/athletic dog that requires a ton of activity. A shar pei is nearly perfect, loyal, protective, loving, good with children, it‚Äôs just the health problems are not a risk I‚Äôm willing to take. I don‚Äôt want a dog that at four years old will have it‚Äôs quality of life spiral before passing away before 8 years old. I know that any dog can become sick or injured, and I know that temperament is not a guarantee, but I‚Äôd like to find a breed that will most likely meet these needs, rather than banking on getting the anomalous cattle dog that‚Äôs mellow and loves children. 

I‚Äôm assertive and structured, so I think I‚Äôll be able to train (at least in a basic capacity) nearly any dog, and it will receive unending affection in our home. Ultimately, it is a pet, not a working dog so finding a good pet that happens to have some of the positives of the guard dog‚Äôs attitude/tendencies is ideal.

She meant absloutely everything to me and now she's gone and I keep thinking I'm going to come home and she's gonna be chilling on the lounge waiting for me but nope. I deeply regret putting her down I want more time with her but I know it was the right thing to do... towards the end she was no longer herself and she was no longer living life all the things she loved doing she could no longer do she was struggling to eat and drink she could no longer remember things (dementia) she was struggling to breath somedays and she couldn't run or do tricks anymore somtimes she couldn't even walk she started spending more of her day sleeping because of the pain and she couldn't even play her favourite games anymore and her medications weren't helping anymore so I know putting her down was the right thing and several other people have told me this but I desperately want her back... I want her back more then anything. Her last day on earth was actually a good day for her she wasn't in as much pain she was able to go to the park and although she couldn't pick her ball up with her mouth she still chased after it her tail wagging the entire time she had a good car ride which she loved and when we got to the vets they gave her a massive bowl of chicken and she actually ate. She wasn't eating much until she went to the vets even a hour before we got to the vets we brought her chicken and steak and iceream and kangaroo treats (her favourite foods) and she couldn't eat any of them but somehow when she went to the vets she ate what looked like half a roast chicken and she loved every bit of it so I know her last day was a good day for her compared to the others but I really wish I could of gotten to do alot more with her. I want her back so desperately and I can't even talk to anyone about it because everyone I know says ""it was just a dog"" NO that ""dog"" meant literally everything to me.

806,dogs,"Hey, hello.
Around last week, my lovely baby girl, Winnie started to throw up and her character seemed to change from happy and energetic to very sensitive and sorry for herself, she changed quite a bit. However for Winnie this had been quite common, she would become sick for 2-3 days and very quiet every now and again however this time was very different from every last time. At the 3rd day she stopped eating entirely, which was very worrying. We tried our best to encourage her eating but we came to the conclusion that it was the food she didn‚Äôt like, and it was this specific brand she was eating that gave her a funny stomach. So we gave her different food and it was going a lot better for a day, we took her on a good walk, she played and was herself. But then the next day in the evening she was puking up again. And she was a lot skinnier, at this point we were getting very worried. But had no idea how she needed us to help her, she had now completely shut down on eating food, hasn‚Äôt been able to poop and now can barely stand up, we haven‚Äôt been able to get to the vet but we‚Äôre booking an emergency vet for tomorrow. Does anyone have any ideas as to what the problem maybe? I‚Äôm really worried for my dog. She‚Äôs also had random moments where she‚Äôs yelped in pain for no apparent reason.

809,dogs,"I'm looking to get a well bred labrador or golden puppy. Right now I'm looking at a specific labrador breeder that I believe is reputable but I have a couple concerns that maybe the r/dogs hivemind can help me work through.

Pros: 

* Local to me, as I'd like to meet the parents and get an in-person idea of the environment they parents and puppies will live in.

* All sires and dams have the required OFA and CHIC testing

* Good lines and temperament goals. Where I live we have a lot of field bred labs (hunting area). Personally I'm looking for a more mellow, bench line variety as the field bred ones will be too drivey/energetic for my tastes. I've met a few dogs from this breeder in local circles and they all seem lovely.

* Raised with puppy culture program

* Host litter meetups onsite after the puppies go home for continued socialization. I love this, after raising a pandemic puppy and struggling to find suitable playmates for her. Yes I know socialization =/= playing with dogs, but I do believe that supervised social interactions with peers are important throughout puppyhood and adolescence. They also provide boarding/daycare/training onsite in case we need that in the future but obviously don't require it.

Cons:

* Is 3 studs and 4 dams too many dogs? All 7 live in the breeder's home. On one hand it's a nice indicator that the parents are multidog household friendly, but on the other they're producing 2-3 litters a year which is on the high side. 

* here's the biggest one: One of their studs is a *silver* lab. Their other studs/all bitches are yellow/black

* the only titles for the black/yellow dogs they display on their website are AKC CGC. The silver lab is of field lines, and has multiple hunting titles. 

Obviously breeding for silver color is a huge red flag. But they have upcoming planned litters without the silver stud. To be clear I'd be getting a yellow/black puppy from yellow/black parents without dilutes in their line. Is it such a red flag to be breeding a (health tested and titled) silver stud that I should disqualify the breeder completely even for in-standard color pairings?

Everything else seems to point that they'd be a good breeder to go with, plus they have upcoming availability. TBF I've found some truly truly reputable breeders for both labs and goldens but have been on their mail list/waitlist for 2+ years with no planned upcoming breedings.

814,dogs,"My (M29) girlfriend (F29) has 3 large mixed Pitbulls that she has had for 4 years. I love them, they are nice and fun to play with. The only problem is that they have no rules or boundaries, which causes issues.
 
She leaves the sliding door open so they can poop/pee in the backyard when they want but she doesn't ever collect the poop so it's common for the dogs to track feces and mud in the house so the floors are always dirty. 

She likes to sleep with her dogs and in the morning she'll let them out and when they come back they jump right on her bed and there's always a bunch of brown dog paw prints that could be mud or poop. Her bed is always full of black specs, dirt and hair.

 1 of her dogs are bad at counter surfing and will always put his dirty paws on the counter to look around and if he gets lucky eat some of our dinner. 

We've been together for about 4 months and I have never seen her bathe or brush her dogs. They stink. I've brought up how dirty her house was before and she said that's just how it is when you have dogs. There have even been times when I would give her a foot massage and I could smell dog feces on her foot. She's really clean when it comes to her own hygiene but her house and dogs are always dirty.

I honestly cannot see myself potentially living in a house where you can't walk barefoot because the floor is dirty, you can't sit anywhere because it's full of hair and dirt, you can't play in the grass because there's poop everywhere and it stinks and there's a high chance 1 of dogs has taken a snip of your food while it was being cooked (I caught 1 of her dogs going to town on some beef she cooked for her lunch prep, I told her about it and she was annoyed by the dog but still used the beef for lunch prep. Which completely disgusted me) 

So would I be in the wrong if I told her I wanted her to have more boundaries and rules for her dogs? Like picking up their feces after they poop so it doesn't get tracked in, maybe even wipe their paws if it's muddy outside so that doesn't get tracked in. Keeping the dogs out of the kitchen with a gate if they can't stop counter surfing, bathing the dogs every month or 2 plus brushing them every other day and maybe not having all the dogs in the bed because it messes with our sleep and intimacy, it's kind of hard to get in the mood with 3 dogs in the bed.",t2_7krs36o0,0,Would I be in the wrong for suggesting to my Girlfriend that she should be more strict with her dogs?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,1055wpo,True,sacramentochillen,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1055wpo/would_i_be_in_the_wrong_for_suggesting_to_my/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1055wpo/would_i_be_in_the_wrong_for_suggesting_to_my/,2479455,1673040082,0,,False,1673040096,1673040097,2023-01-06 21:21:22,,,,,

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? **Yes, this will be my first dog**.
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? **I am planning on going through a reputable breeder.** 
3. Describe your ideal dog. My ideal dog is one who is friendly and and reliable. **I am looking for a best friend, companion, and walking/jogging buddy. My boyfriend and I frequently take trips to the beach and would love to take it with us there, as well.** 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? **I have always been very interested in Goldens  for their personality and size, as well as ease of training. I also love Bernese Mountain Dogs, for most of the same reasons, though I know they can be a bit more stubborn than Goldens in terms of training.** 
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? **Basic obedience, crate training, loose leash walking, respecting boundaries, etc. Nothing too out of the ordinary.**
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? **No**.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? **2+ hours a day. This includes long walks (2+ miles) as well as trips to the park and mental stimulation (hunt + sniff puzzles).**

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? **I'm willing to groom as necessary depending on the dogs needs, but will also be seeing a professional regardless. Overall, I would prefer a dog that doesn't shed too too much, but it's not a dealbreaker.** 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for? **Medium. Around 40-60ish pounds.** 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? **I am fine with some shedding, not so much barking and and slobbering. I'm able to deal with barking as long as it's controlled/for a purpose.**

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? **I would like for my dog to be friendly - greeting neighbors/visitors/friends/family in a respectful way. Obviously this comes with training, but I would like it's temperament to be friendly.** 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? **No. I am looking for a dog that respects and can coexist peacefully with other animals, including dogs.** 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid? **Aside from number 16, not really.** 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? **My boyfriend and I both work from home, so it won't be home alone for more than 3-4 hours at a time.** 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? **My boyfriend loves dogs and has experience training multiple seeing eye dogs, so he will be very invested and involved in caring for the dog alongside me. In terms of preferences, his mostly echo mine.** 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? **We have one cat, so being able to peacefully coexist is important to me.** 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? **No.** 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? **By the time we get a dog, we will be homeowners, so N/A.**

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. **I just want to emphasize how excited I am to be adding a dog to my family; this is something I've wanted for a very long time, and feel that by next year I will be ready to finally get one. The process of finding the right breed/fit for me is very important, and I am willing to put in the time and research so that I am prepared.

I have COVID. Was exposed over New Years, started having symptoms Wednesday. and by yesterday (Thursday) I was very sick. I live in an apartment with no elevator at the top floor and have a little corgi 8 month old puppy named Homer. He's a lot of energy and needs a lot of exercise. I live with my partner but she's in another country for a wedding right now, and my parents left today for a vacation. My mom thankfully brought Homer to boarding/daycare place, but he could be in there over a week and I feel so bad. The longest he's stayed there is a day and I feel like I'm failing him. I just can't do the walks and carry him up the stairs 4+ a day (he's still kind of scared of stairs, working on it). 

Have you boarded your dogs for a long time? We put him in yesterday and he may end up being there until the 14th. I miss him and I just feel terrible about it.

824,dogs,"Hi folks, we currently have a female Shepherd that has an ovary sparing spay (no uterus, yes ovaries so can't get pregnant, can't get pyo, does go into heat but doesn't bleed or have any discharge). 

We are considering a second dog. It would be another larger breed (likely another Shepherd from the same breeder) so if we did a male this dog would either be neutered later in life or would get a vasectomy but not a neuter. 

The main concern I have is what we can expect from heats from the female. Obviously pregnancy is not a problem, but the question is whether there are other concerns. Due to the OPS the female has right now she does go into heats, but we only really notice when it is over because she starts nesting (if you take close looks at her vulva obviously you can tell but that's not on my daily list of things I do with my dog).

I have heard stories of male dogs going super crazy around females in heat but with the OPS other dogs don't seem to notice much. That said most of the male dogs we see around are fully neutered.

825,dogs,"Lost my dog to diabetes

I just want to vent. My wife and I decided to do long distance from where I work, so for the last year and a bit I‚Äôve been only home on weekends. My dog is my best friend. He‚Äôs my guy. 

We had our second baby in July and I took over parental leave for the last 6 months starting December. I was so excited to be home with my family for 6 months straight. I noticed my dog seemed skinnier and was drinking more water than usual (but he tends to do this during winter and loves eating snow). He seemed off some days. I thought he was maybe depressed from the second child and me being away, I thought to myself that now I‚Äôm back I‚Äôll give him lots of love and he‚Äôll go back to normal. I booked a vet appointment because I was worried about his weight but the earliest I could get was January 19 (telling them I was quite concerned). 

He was still eating so I felt good about that, fast forward to jan 2, he had no appetite or want to drink water. I called the vet to see if I can get him in asap. They couldn‚Äôt get me in until the 5th. I drove an hour to a different vet to get him in that day and they said he had diabetes. 

It was killing me seeing him each day dwindling and was hoping insulin would be the answer but it was too far gone. He died the next day after 1 full day of insulin treatment. It kills me inside and I‚Äôm so sad. These days are so lonely without him. I thought I‚Äôd have him by my side every day. He was so young. I slept in the living room with him each night until he passed. 

The vet said to give him insulin even if I got a teaspoon of food in him so I was syringe feeding him that day. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt of. I feel like it brought his blood sugar too low because he couldn‚Äôt even walk, it was so sad. I gave him honey because the ER vet said it sounded like low blood sugar. I woke up to him in the same spot he slept in. I kept my 5th vet appointment hoping he‚Äôd make it until then to get more answers. 

I know there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I did all I could with my knowledge. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about if the vet had let me in when I first called to book. He was still eating, I feel like it would have worked. I didn‚Äôt know it was possible for this all to happen so fast. If it is why didn‚Äôt they get me in right away? Or tell me to get him in elsewhere? Within 5 days it went from him eating and playing with me to not eating drinking or able to walk. It‚Äôs my last memories of my little 4 year old King Charles spaniel and it‚Äôs so hard to carry on with my day.

826,dogs,"Hello all, as the title suggests, I have a friend who is considering rehoming his border 9 year old collie/German shepherd mix. 

Backstory: he was 19, now 28 when he got her, he had dogs growing up and thought it would be nice to have a companion to do stuff with. The puppy years were awful and he really rattled with if he could do this for X amount of years and if he even enjoyed owning a dog. He recently shared with me that since he‚Äôs had her, he‚Äôs went back and forth about keeping her. The dilemma is, he loves her and she loves him and he‚Äôs afraid of what her mental state would be if he were to give her up. Sadly, his mental health is the main concern. He has major depression and just yesterday told me he‚Äôs been having suicidal thoughts (which are common for him) and just feels trapped with having her until she dies. She‚Äôs not the cause of his depression, but she makes it worse rather than better. 

Apart from the internal guilt and sadness he‚Äôd feel, he‚Äôs really worried about his friends and family‚Äôs opinion. He‚Äôs worried they‚Äôll judge him and that every person he sees that asks about her will have to hear how he rehomed her due to his mental health. It just seems like a lot. 

 My advice to him was: put your mask on first. Not everyone is cut out for dog ownership. The fact that he has stuck it out for 9 years trying to make it better, is far more commendable than those that dump dogs to the shelters once their lives are slightly inconvenienced. I tell him that sticking along this long makes him such a  good person and he just says no, it‚Äôs just my own guilt. Which isn‚Äôt true, of course he feels guilt but that‚Äôs because he truly cares about her. He just beats himself up about a situation that he can‚Äôt help. 

The thing is, his depression can be debilitating. He can barely take care of himself. This dog needs a lot of love and affection and he‚Äôs not the owner that will provide that.

829,dogs,"I just want to vent. My wife and I decided to do long distance from where I work, so for the last year and a bit I‚Äôve been only home on weekends. My dog is my best friend. He‚Äôs my guy. 

We had our second baby in July and I took over parental leave for the last 6 months starting December. I was so excited to be home with my family for 6 months straight. I noticed my dog seemed skinnier and was drinking more water than usual (but he tends to do this during winter and loves eating snow). He seemed off some days. I thought he was maybe depressed from the second child and me being away, I thought to myself that now I‚Äôm back I‚Äôll give him lots of love and he‚Äôll go back to normal. I booked a vet appointment because I was worried about his weight but the earliest I could get was January 19 (telling them I was quite concerned). 

He was still eating so I felt good about that, fast forward to jan 2, he had no appetite or want to drink water. I called the vet to see if I can get him in asap. They couldn‚Äôt get me in until the 5th. I drove an hour to a different vet to get him in that day and they said he had diabetes. 

It was killing me seeing him each day dwindling and was hoping insulin would be the answer but it was too far gone. He died the next day after 1 full day of insulin treatment. It kills me inside and I‚Äôm so sad. These days are so lonely without him. I thought I‚Äôd have him by my side every day. He was so young. I slept in the living room with him each night until he passed. 

The vet said to give him insulin even if I got a teaspoon of food in him so I was syringe feeding him that day. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt of. I feel like it brought his blood sugar too low because he couldn‚Äôt even walk, it was so sad. I gave him honey because the ER vet said it sounded like low blood sugar. I woke up to him in the same spot he slept in. I kept my 5th vet appointment hoping he‚Äôd make it until then to get more answers. 

I know there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I did all I could with my knowledge. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about if the vet had let me in when I first called to book. He was still eating, I feel like it would have worked. I didn‚Äôt know it was possible for this all to happen so fast. If it is why didn‚Äôt they get me in right away? Or tell me to get him in elsewhere? Within 5 days it went from him eating and playing with me to not eating drinking or able to walk.

832,dogs,"My dog is a 1 1/2 year old german shepherd. When he was a puppy he did fine on kibble. we did occasionally switch his proteins but he was also fine with that and never really had a problem digesting different proteins. (which now i know wasn‚Äôt that great of an idea because allergies and what not) about 6 months ago i noticed when i switched him back to a lamb diet and he had diarrhea. i figured it was just the switch of the food too soon so i fasted him then continued to feed the same food. didn‚Äôt stop.

then i suspected it could be a protein allergy. i ended up fasting him again and put him on a bland diet of turkey and rice. that made it worse. after that i slowly switched from the bland diet to chicken kibble which is what he always did best on and seems to like the most. i tried to switch up the foods to see what he‚Äôd do best on. anyways, the diarrhea never stopped. i ended up fasting again, then slowly transitioned to turkey kibble. 

nothing helped NOTHING. so i put him BACK on a bland diet. didn‚Äôt work. i took him to the emergency vet because i was so fed up and started crying because i feel so bad for him. they said he didn‚Äôt have any parasites or infections but that he could be allergic to all of the proteins he‚Äôs eaten within that time frame or have IBD. they gave us some propectalin and something else to help his stomach. they said we need to give him a protein he‚Äôs never had because he may have developed allergies or food aversions. he said to switch his food to a new kibble protein that he‚Äôs never had asap after another fast and that diarrhea is going to be inevitable for a while until the medication works. 

deep down i suspected the kibble may be making it extremely hard to digest if his stomach is already upset so i researched a lot and found out that raw diets are a lot easier on the stomach. i got him a bag of frozen tuckers salmon and pumpkin pattie‚Äôs . (35$ a bag and it lasts my very large dog 3 days)

 anyways, it worked! a little too well. he became a little constipated and had dry poop that fell apart into chunks when i tried picking it up. it was almost chalky! so i added water/ made sure he was drinking enough water. nothing helped but it was better than diarrhea in my eyes.  it tried as SLWOLY as possible to switch him to a new salmon kibble. he started having loose stool once 75% of his food was kibble. 

so i made sure to never add more than half kibble and BAM he has the most normal stool in months! the problem is, it‚Äôs NOT consistent and that worries me! also, i can‚Äôt afford to keep feeding him 450$ a month worth of dog food. sometimes we run out of his raw food and for a day he has to eat only his kibble and then he has diarrhea for the entire day even with propectalin tablets.

eventually i want to switch him back to a good kibble with grains and maybe get one raw patty a day but it seems like he just will not eat ANYTHING fully kibble! i don‚Äôt want to mix his food anymore. i want him to be able to just be good on one food with consistent healthy poop. should i just keep trying to transition him into the kibble and pray to god it turns normal? idk. i feel like mixing the food that gives him diarrhea and the food that makes his stool chalky to make a ‚Äúgood‚Äù poop is cheating. doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs actually solving the problem. wtf do i do???? any suggestions are helpful, thanks.

833,dogs,"Sorry that this is so long!

My partner and I fostered a 6 month old puppy for most of December. He had his issues like any pup but overall he was great. About a week before it came time to adopt him or return him to the shelter, we decided that even though we love him, we didn‚Äôt think it would be the right fit. While always made sure to give him lots of love and attention and we have a great yard for him to run around in, we felt that he would do better in a household where someone was home all the time, and maybe where his humans could be more physically active with him since my partner and I both suffer from mental illness (and my partner also deals with chronic physical illness)

When we dropped him at the shelter, it was very unceremonious. They quickly brought him into the back. We didn‚Äôt get asked any questions or even get a chance to say goodbye. I was devastated. It got worse when we came home to a house without him. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying all day.

The next morning, I was still very upset. I went onto the shelter‚Äôs website and noticed that they took his adoption listing down. I figured that was that. He was in someone else‚Äôs home. I asked my partner that, if down the line we saw him back up for adoption from a shelter, could we adopt him? They said that if I really wanted, I should call the shelter and see if he was still available. So I did, thinking that, at worst he‚Äôd be gone and then at least I‚Äôd maybe feel a sense of closure and be happy that he found a home. But the person from the shelter told me he was still available. So I made the impulse decision to adopt him

I was a little nervous, but overall I felt great. After all, I spent a month taking care of him already and truly loved the whole experience, even when it was difficult. 

However, as soon as I got him in the car I started feeling anxious. Did I do the right thing? Should I have been so impulsive? After all, we had our misgivings for a reason. We didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be able to give him the best home that he deserved. That was two days ago. Since then, my anxiety has gotten worse and worse. I‚Äôve had trouble eating and sleeping and can‚Äôt think about anything aside from how I might have made a huge mistake. 

I feel so awful and guilty, because I do truly love the lil guy. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. My heart breaks at the thought of giving him up again but I‚Äôm also terrified that just loving him isn‚Äôt enough and that I won‚Äôt be the best pet parent. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

834,dogs,"Hi everyone. I usually don‚Äôt make Reddit posts, but at this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm a first time dog owner and I‚Äôve had my boy for a little over a year. I love him so much, but recently he‚Äôs been really dragging down my mental state and triggering my anxiety. He‚Äôs a black lab mix that‚Äôs about 19 months old and we got him at the shelter when he was 4 months old. Generally speaking, he‚Äôs a good dog. But ever since about 6 months he‚Äôs had eating issues. Getting bored of food fast and not wanting to eat. He has bilious syndrome, so that complicates the situation. We‚Äôve spent a lot of money on wet food and dry food combos, which he likes for about two weeks and then gets bored. He‚Äôs also a very noise reactive dog, meaning if he hears something that scares him (which is everything), he becomes very skittish and standoffish for the rest of the day. He used to be a very active dog that loved the dog park, but about three weeks ago he suddenly stopped wanting to play and shuns other dogs when they approach him. He was a very outgoing, lively dog and this suddenly change in behavior confuses me. Now we go to the park and he just stands around staring at the parking lot. These last three weeks, he hasn‚Äôt been eating, hasn‚Äôt been playing, and generally just mopes around the house.

840,dogs,"So my dog is a 1y old am-staff mix and I‚Äôve had her since my partner and I rescued her at 5 months old. She is the kindest, most affectionate dog to everyone she‚Äôs met‚Ä¶ except my BIL. 

Now my dog is the furthest thing from aggressive, at most she‚Äôll do a bark or two at new people and then smother them in hugs, kisses and try to give them high fives (I taught her to high-five so now she slaps new people). But anytime my BIL comes over she will not stop growling and barking at him. I would like to say that I do not like my BIL for many reasons that I won‚Äôt get into but I‚Äôm civil. But I do not like him around me or in my space. He can‚Äôt even really get close to her because the hairs raise on the back of her neck and it‚Äôs the most angry I‚Äôve ever seen her get. Now he has crossed her boundaries a few times and won‚Äôt listen to my partner and I on how we treat/raise/respect her (for example putting his fingers in her face and yelling at her, smacking her, yelling at her when she jumped on the couch/our bed). Now I think this is the reason she doesn‚Äôt like him, but some people in my life think it‚Äôs because I have such a strong dislike of him and she‚Äôs picked up on my vibes. Could I be the reason she hates my BIL? 

I would like to also add she doesn‚Äôt go out of her way to interact with BIL. She barks when he comes inside, then I calm her down and she just watches him from a distance and if he gets too close to partner or I she‚Äôll run over to us and start barking at him, or if he approaches her she gets very upset.

845,dogs,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have always been a big dog lover, I grew up with an epileptic Portuguese water dog and was the primary caretaker, did 4H etc. with him. As an adult, I fostered dogs for a couple years for a local rescue and then foster failed with a 6 year old Akita mix who we had for 10 years until she passed away from very aggressive cancer which we tried surgery and chemo to treat. I have always taken basic + obedience classes with our dogs and usually some agility classes too for extra exercise and mental stimulation in the winter. I am the person that all my friends and family reach out to for training/behavior questions or help picking a new dog. But i am stumped for myself.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Because we have small children my preference is to go through a reputable breeder for a dog with sound predictable temperament and health. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Family companion, happy to relax in the house, go on long walks in the evening and camping on the weekend, trainable for recall and basic obedience but not needing hours of mental stimulation and a job. Somewhat independent and not too ‚Äúin your face‚Äù with strangers.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* From looks we really like fluffy dogs with pointy ears with decent breed health. So spitz breeds that are good with kids like Keeshonds, Samoyeds, and Eurasiers, I love Finnish Lapphunds and Icelandic Sheepdogs but think we don‚Äôt have the energy to dedicate to their mental needs. I also have been thinking about rough collies as a herding breed that is a little more relaxed than other collies and shepherds. I wouldn‚Äôt be against another Portuguese water dog or standard poodle but I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy always having to tell people they aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúdoodle‚Äù. Open to other breeds, who haven‚Äôt i thought of?

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Recall is the most important thing. Otherwise the basics sit, stay, settle.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I enjoy doing some agility work and i think recreational herding would also be fun, but nothing more than a casual weekend activity.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Dedicated probably 30 minutes to an hour a day and a weekly class, more dedicated time with a puppy.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* An hour for walks (shorter in the morning, longer in the evening), weekend excursions to state parks for family hikes. We have a fenced-in yard for running around, fetch etc. but I still think a dog needs to get out and smell new things at least twice a day. I do not go to dog parks.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Whatever, I had a PWD that needed brushing and regular professional grooming and an akita mix that needed brushing 1-2 times a week. I have done ear cleaning at home but like pointy eared dogs where it isn‚Äôt as much of an issue.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* 30-70lbs, small enough to fit in a canoe without capsizing the boat

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Any shedding is fine, barking to alert is also fine. Not a fan of slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Pretty important, we like to go camping and backcountry canoeing so having a dog that will hang out at the campsite without getting tangled in a long line is very nice.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle, likes to be pet but isn‚Äôt on top of you all the time. Personal space when it comes to non-immediate family members, my inlaws are a little hesitant around dogs.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* I am used to a dog that wants to problem solve on their own so I am ok with that, but would like a dog that is somewhat biddable. I don‚Äôt like super ‚Äúgoofy‚Äù dogs, a little reservation is nice.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Barking is fine with us, most dog breeds i like are pretty vocal, but it is not a necessity.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Our last rescue was reactive to other dogs and we took classes but primarily just avoided putting her in situations that would make her uncomfortable knowing that she just didn‚Äôt like to be around other dogs. We would prefer a dog that was not aggressive to other dogs because it makes finding a friend to dogsit much easier.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Resource guarding with children.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Comfortable with the occasional 8 hours we work from home so that isn‚Äôt the usual. But job situations can change.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We share dog preferences.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, we have two babies but are looking to find a breeder and get on a wait list to get a dog when they are a couple years older.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Cold snowy winters, we often go a week or two with temperatures staying below 0F. Summers are also hot in the 90s and 100F

848,dogs,"We recently lost our 15 year old male (chow / Samoyed mix) to old age and wanted to get a new companion for our 10 year old female (American Eskimo / shepherd mix)

We rescued the male from the streets about 13 years ago and he was in bad shape when he found us from living on his own so long. He wandered into our yard and he was ours after that. He was young but full grown so I estimate we neutered around 1.5-2 years of age. It took years of training to rehabilitate him and he was a wonderful, loving companion but his only bad habit was pissing on the corners of our couches, curtains, etc.

851,dogs,"We live in a big apartment complex where dogs are allowed, provided the owners have paid a pet deposit, pet rent, have dogs on a leash and provide current vaccination records. Well, not many dog owners are actually keeping the leash rule and our dog has been terrorized by others as a result. One dog in particular is extra aggressive despite being a small and ‚Äúcute‚Äù breed. 

Three days ago my husband was walking home with our toddler at night through a very icy parking lot when he came across the dog‚Äôs owners who had both their dogs off leash. The small one ran to him and bit his ankle while the owners were completely oblivious and either didn‚Äôt notice or pretended not to and my husband was so frazzled he just wanted to get away and off the ice. He came home and told me about the incident. 

He had to wash some blood off his ankle so we know the bite broke skin, but it was also through his pants and his sock so we are unsure if that counts as direct skin contact. We don‚Äôt know if any additional treatment is necessary for the bite or if their dog is even vaccinated (they should be to live here, but since they don‚Äôt follow all the rules I don‚Äôt want to take any chances, especially when rabies could potentially be involved).

I do not know who the owners are or where they live. I have an idea of what area of the complex but I can‚Äôt just knock 40 doors and hope they‚Äôre home, do they have an aggressive poodle mix who they frequently let off leash who recently bit someone, and can we demand their vet records. 

I reached out to the apartment manager for help. We gave them all the information we had so they could file an incident report, and they said they would try to investigate who it was and help us negotiate getting the proper vet records, etc. Well, that was three days ago and it‚Äôs been radio silence. If there‚Äôs any chance at all of rabies being involved, shouldn‚Äôt they be acting quicker than this? I don‚Äôt want to be paranoid but I also know you don‚Äôt mess around with rabies and that it‚Äôs quite time sensitive. 

I would like some advice on what to do next and who is liable should something bad happen. Should my husband just go to the doctor and eat the cost of rabies treatment even if it turns out to be unnecessary? We are in the US by the way so even with insurance I am anticipating the cost to be quite hefty. Should someone else be paying for it? Should it be the dog owner since it was their dog, or the apartment management since it happened on their property by a dog that they allowed to live there who attacked a man with his toddler?

867,dogs,"My 4yo dog Mona has always been skittish. She is a rescue, but lived her whole life in foster care (her pregnant mom was found in GA and transported to the rescue org and a foster home in NJ). I visited the home the night she was adopted and the family was great, house was great, littermates were sweet, and they had a big fenced in yard. So I‚Äôm not sure how/why she became so skittish. 

Anyway, the **point of this post**: she has always been afraid of loud noises, especially thunder, fireworks, and shouting. She will cower and go hide in the closet or she will go upstairs and hide in the bathtub and shake. Over Thanksgiving weekend, I was walking Mona and my other \[unphased\] dog and the town started lighting off ""holiday"" fireworks. I don‚Äôt live there anymore (we separated) so I had no idea fireworks were scheduled. But it was nighttime and about 5 min into our walk, fireworks starting going off very close to the house and our walking route, lasting for about 20 minutes. Mona wouldn‚Äôt let me walk in either direction (I wanted to turn around and go back home). Instead, she pulled me up on someone‚Äôs porch (which happened to be the front porch of our vet/animal hospital) and sat there and cowered for the remainder of the fireworks. I had to pick her up (\~40lbs) off the top step and force her to walk back home after they ended.

Ever since, she does not like going for walks. She will put on the breaks and stand still and want to go back home right after she pees, if that. So getting her to go poop is tough. Is there a way to deal with this and help her somehow? I have no idea what can be done. My ex (who they live with) is the one who does all the walking now and says every day and night (except for really late night walks, I‚Äôm talking 1-2am)she will stop in her tracks and want to turn around.

888,dogs,"My bf has a pitbull (an American Bully, to be exact) that he rescued from a terrible breeder who used to abuse the dog (his name is Bruce). Bruce is 2 now so he‚Äôs still fairly young but he definitely missed out on the TLC and socialization that all puppies NEED in order to function properly as a fully grown dog.

Bruce has very specific triggers that cause him to completely just tweak out and bite whatever (or horrifyingly, whoever) happens to be close to him. Known triggers include: other male dogs (especially dogs that are bigger than he is) and fences (Bruce was hit, most likely many times by fences and big doors as a puppy / when he was still with the shitty breeder).

So far, Bruce has bitten my bf (a handful of times, actually. One time my bf passed out afterwards) and his best friend. He attacked me just last month while I was walking him and as I was screaming for help, my bf‚Äôs neighbour heard me and came out to help. Bruce bit him too. The neighbour had to go to the hospital and get stitches because Bruce bit his arm. Bruce bit my hand and leg, which hurt me a lot and even traumatized me too, actually, but I‚Äôm trying my best to not live in fear and I care about how this is all affecting my bf so I wanna be there for him.

On January 2nd my bf left for vacation. He‚Äôs only gone for a week but he needed people to walk and feed Bruce. I don‚Äôt know too many details because my bf told me that he wanted to discuss things properly when he gets back, but one of my bf‚Äôs friends who was supposed to be taking care of Bruce was also bitten tonight as well.

I‚Äôm scared that, although my bf means well and his intentions are true, Bruce is becoming too much for him to handle.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels extremely unfair that Bruce was abused and that he missed out on early socialization. I‚Äôm also terrified of him and what he‚Äôs capable of. I don‚Äôt want there to be another victim.

889,dogs,"Hi everyone,

TW: suicide

I've always been a dog person since I was little. I've never met a dog I couldn't ""tame"", sounds a bit funny....But I've never ever had issues with an aggressive dog, owners always shocked that they just seem to like me even when they are aggressive dogs. Growing up I visited my grandmother most holidays and spent the entire time outside with the farm dogs (Kelpies, Maremmas and Heelers) and their puppies.

I had a really bad childhood though growing up with my mother. I was physically, emotionally and sexually abused by her. She was a drug addict, alcoholic and prostitute. I'm also certain she has narcissistic personality disorder. My father was seldom around and gave very little care.  
I had a pet dog Shihtzu growing up-my mother would strangle her in front of me in order to torment me. Then we later got a Papillion (my mothers choice) which was her dog, didn't really care for me since I didn't feed him and he always followed her rules (no beds, no licking..no affection).

2019, I'm 23 and live away from home. I am earning my own money and decide I will get a dog. I decided to get a small dog incase I need to live in an apartment. I got this amazing pomeranian from Gumtree (Kind of like craiglist). He was the most beautiful pomeranian I've ever seen in my entire life, (even on instagram or pomeranian calendars etc). They just don't make them like this. He was UNREAL. Everyone who ever met him was in awe and people would shout out of their car windows when I would walk him that he was the most beautiful dog they'd ever seen. He was also extremely affectionate. We were strongly bonded. Most of the time if we were not going on walks, or I was not working, he would be inside my jacket like a baby while I did things. Then I started looking after my friends dog for her and they became friends, but the friends dog figured out how to escape from my backyard. This is where the trouble began. One day I came back from a house inspection, because i was hoping to find another place to live (due to him learning how to escape the yard). I put him to the toilet and left him in the yard for maybe 5 minutes. He ran underneath the hole under the house (not sure where exactly, but he was only 1.5kg) and directly on to the road. He was immediately killed. I felt like I had lost a child and to this day I am still morning him. He only lived 11 months. I cannot look at pictures of him still. 

I immediately got in contact with the breeder (as I was feeling suicidal) and I drove 38 hours.

I drive to the breeders property and lo and behold she has a puppy farm. I did not know this because she met me in the city centre since her house is so far out into the Australian bush.  
She had about 100 pomeranians who were being treated extremely poorly. My mother was there at the time and influenced me to get two. I stupidly walked away and didn't get his Father but luckily my mother convinced me to get a girl. I had to chase this one girl around for a very long time. She was a dead ringer of my first pom. I also got a male. I picked the most vulnerable and scared ones who resembled my dog. And now having known this female (nala) I firmly believe she is a sibling of my dog who was run over (Henry). By the way they were very undernourished and I immediately took them to the Vet to get their health in order. I also reported the farm anonymously.  


Simba (the male) has turned out to have extreme anxiety. He doesn't display this behaviour in any other way but by freezing up when strangers hold him like a solid rock. I believe he was abused. Nala on the other hand has the most amazing personality in the world. She came out of her shell (I believe she was neglected). She is by far my favourite. I love her with all my heart and it very seriously kills me knowing she will die one day. I would cut off my own arm if it meant she lived forever.   


Last year I drove back to the puppy farm and bought another relative. I did actually anonymously report her puppy farm once I had left and as it turns out she had only about 20 pomeranians and all the males were desexed. I picked up another ringer of Henry, his name is Elvis. Elvis and Nala would have made Henry lookalikes but sadly Elvis has been desexed due to my reporting I'm guessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes to the awkward part. I have been accidentally breeding Nala and Simba. The first litter was an accident (my fault) and I kept one of the two puppies. One of the puppies died (three total) which was horrible. I had to race her to the emergency vet because she had dystocia. The puppy was too large and died. I kept the black and white one, who was very naughty, and I have turned her into a very obedient and fantastic little girl but she screams bloody murder if anyone walks into the house.

I was pressured at the time into giving away the other puppy, I know the other puppy has an amazing life but I miss her terribly. It bothers me a lot.

I have kept Nala and Simba not desexed til now because I have always hoped they will make Henry (lookalikes) or just Henry, or even another Nala, when I'm ready and live on a rural property with lots of space. At the moment, I live in a house on a 516m2 block (large backyard).

They have had two more accidental litters due to me living with housemates and them mixing them up when I have kept them separate. I have a very keen eye, I know my girls' cycle and know when to separate but it is hard living with other people.

In the litter before the recent one we birthed the most perfect little girl via C-section (emergency). Nala gave birth to a stillborn and the emergency vet recommended emergency C-section. Turns out she was tiny and didn't need the c-section. She had a fantastic personality but her and I did not bond very strongly, given I had three already I sold her at 3 months to a very wealthy very well setup gay couple. I know she is very happy. For some reason I do not miss her as much.

The recent litter has born two pomeranians via planned c section. Turns out they're enormous. I'm not sure what happened but at 4 months old they are already bigger than mum. I love them both and I cannot stomach to give them away. I think I would miss them too much. They are very strongly bonded to mum and cry whenever shes not near. I am training them with some separation at night time. We are starting puppy schools soon also which I have not done for my other dogs. 

This means that I now have six pomeranians. For me its great. But technically its not allowed. I could face a very large fine and have them taken away if someone reported me. It's also a lot of work. They demand a lot of care and it impacts my relationship with my boyfriend..he is jealous. I do pay someone to assist at times also because I sometimes have very late working hours. 

I watched the c-section and watched Nala as she woke up from the anaesthesia. She was shaking for a very long time. I decided then that I would not put her through childbirth anymore no matter what. However, I cannot stomach desexing her. I can't bear having the possibility of having another child from her taken away. To me her children are my grandchildren. I think about the first puppy often and miss her a lot. That's why I've kept the two new babies. Nobody understands me here. People don't treat their dogs the way I treat mine. 

I also firmly believe that there are no pomeranians in the entire world that are as beautiful and also as pleasant as mine. My pomeranians are on another level. They are affectionate and loyal and beautiful. If you've come this far, my insta is fourpomeranians where you can see the adults. I do not believe that I will ever be able to find another pomeranian like them. So I do consider inbreeding the puppies so that I can keep their line going forever. I'm sure this is some kind of mental illness symptom of mine. But I've managed to get away with it so far without any consequence. 

I'm worried about my obsession..mainly because I have a lot of nightmares about it. The nightmares are like this:

1. That they all escape and I have to run all over the road trying to catch them all. But it's impossible to hold 6 pomeranians in your arms. And they don't understand the danger. Neither do the cars on the road.
2. That I breed so many puppies that I lose track and some of them die from neglect and starvation. This is a repetitive dream I have.
3. That some of them escape and people return them to me and I don't even know they've escaped.
4. That I inbreed Simba and the baby's so that they are deformed and die.

My psychologist believes that it's okay that I have this many dogs. But maybe this is her style of psychology. She believes that they are good for my mental health and provide me what I don't get from my family. My friends and partner thinks its nuts and are trying to get me to downsize.

By the way, I make a considerable amount of money so that they are well taken care of. They receive the best diet and all their vaccinations and health needs taken care of. We have had multiple emergency veterinary situations, where they stay a few nights in hospital and I have no problems financially caring for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what I'm going through or know anyone who can relate? What do I even do? Am I wrong, right, crazy?

How do I desex Nala?

I can't bear to have her little organs removed. I also can't bear the fact that she will be forever the only Nala and I will never have more of her. I am scare of her getting pyometra.

Also, I will not be desexing my male dogs. I have no large reason to until they are older and at risk of testicular cancer.",t2_gk6273pt,0,I have 6 pomeranians. And I won't desex my dogs.

They only had one litter and they bred them mostly because they wanted a pup from their dogs themselves, rather then because they wanted money.

Both parents were health screened, hip scored, and had the necessary tests done to ensure the pups would be healthy, the parents also have great temperaments and are very highly trained in both advanced obedience and protection work.

The pups were also vaccinated, microchipped, and had some decent early socialisation and exposure to various things and noises before being rehomed.

The breeder also had a contract, including a lifetime return policy that meant that if the pups had to be rehomed at any point, the breeder would be willing to take them back.

The breeder definitely had the dogs welfare in mind with the breeding, given all the measures that were taken. They have since sterilised both parents and they don't intend to breed anymore dogs.

895,dogs,"Hi, I got a Pomeranian husky a almost a year and a half ago. He's traveled to New York, New Jersey, and finally back to Pakistan with me after my studies ended. When I got him he had giardia (breeder blocked my number when I informed him) so I couldn't get any socialization in or even call a trainer as they needed a complete health checkup to be clear before they came. He's a really good dog and amazing with commands, when he's not in his husky mood in which he knows what i'm saying but doesn't want to do it. I've managed to train him very well with commands and get him used to my routine / people in my house.

However, the constant problem since I first got him is that he goes crazy when he see's a friend of mine come over. He will try to jump on them, be greedy for affection (even though he gets more than enough already) and will try and dominate the guests into giving him attention. I've tried leashing him to a sofa and then ask guests to pet him when he's calm, or sometimes i'll use treats as he is food driven. However he still hasn't learned to be calm when people come. Nobody pets him when he's hyper and they immediately pet him when he's calm but Buddy still isn't associating his hyperness with people not wanting to be near him when he's like that. I've tried treats, the tap on the nose/bum when he's being overly hyper, and also leashing him in another room altogether (although when i do this he barks throughout their visit). Any tips on how I can get him calm around guests? He is now 2 years old and a very good boy otherwise. He also has separation anxiety when i'm home and away from him. I can manage with him when guests come over but my dad and brother want to not have to worry about him disturbing the guests. Any tips are appreciated!

At first, giving her a small snack around midnight seemed to solve the issue, but it's come back and seems to be getting worse. Went to the vet and he ordered blood tests. He found two elevated proteins, one which is indicating a current virus infection and one that indicates a mild allergy. He is not concerned about the virus, saying that there's currently a stomach bug going around and that's likely what's making her symptoms worse, but that it should clear up on its own. For the allergy that's causing her upset tummy in the mornings, he suggested an elimination diet. For this we need to find a food that has only one protein source and one carbohydrate and as little additives as possible. Both have to be rare in dog food, he suggested something like horse and potatoe or sweet potatoe.

905,dogs,"kaya is my best friend, always has been. i‚Äôve had her since she was 2, and she just turned 10 last year. i never really considered she might die one day but i feel like that reality has hit me like a brick wall now that she‚Äôs going up in age. 

she‚Äôs a siberian husky and in amazing health, still spry as ever but i imagine that the decline can come fast when it does, and i just have so many questions and worries. she‚Äôs been with me through every milestone in my life. my first job, first apartment, first relationship, finally leaving my abusive family, moving across the country to seattle. like, she‚Äôs just always been there for my entire adult life and the thought of one day her not being there? it‚Äôs fucking torture, it‚Äôs unfair, and it‚Äôs stupid that dogs have to die. i‚Äôm so angry about it.

i find every day i‚Äôm noticing more and more things i‚Äôm going to miss. the dog hair everywhere, her snoring, the spins she does before i take her outside, the way she paws me and puts her forehead against me when she wants attention, her talking back to me when i tease her, the way she smells and how comforting it is to lay in bed with her back against my stomach and just petting her for hours and hours. she is the perfect dog, she is half of who i am, i love her more than i love myself and i just can‚Äôt believe she has to die one day. 

i‚Äôm scared that when the time comes, i‚Äôll be too selfish to put her down if i have to. i‚Äôll keep denying it for myself. i do have BPD so someone leaving my life is extremely distressing, and for her it‚Äôs no different. and what happens after? do i take her to the vet, or do they euthanize her in my home? and what after that? what do they do with her, do they take her from my house after she‚Äôs gone to cremate her? does she stay here? do i have to do it myself? 

i know this is a dramatic post and i know she still has some years in her but fuck man. it legitimately torments me sometimes. my dog has been the closest thing to unconditional love i‚Äôve ever had and she‚Äôs the only person i‚Äôve been able to love back unconditionally and i can‚Äôt stand knowing she will be gone one day.",t2_v8jybmyr,0,"late at night these days, i always seem to think about how i‚Äôm going to cope when my dogs time comes.","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,104og05,True,DurianLitchi,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/104og05/late_at_night_these_days_i_always_seem_to_think/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/104og05/late_at_night_these_days_i_always_seem_to_think/,2479284,1672991845,0,,False,1672991857,1672991858,2023-01-06 07:57:25,,,,,
906,dogs,"Hello!

First time here, but I'm curious what you all might have to say.  I've been with my girlfriend for a long time...8+ years.  And since before I met her she's had this pit mix.   And to put it lightly...he's been a handful ever since we met.  He's hyperactive, he's stubborn, he doesn't play well with others, and he's possessive.  But in his older age (he's 11+ now) he's chilled out a bit.  He's still not great with other dogs (our in-laws have puppies and he's quite awkward around them.  He's either barking at them aggressively or trying to hump them).  But my GF thinks (I would say ""romanticizes"") that bringing in a new puppy would help him in his old age and keep him active.

I should say that I know very little about dogs...I never grew up with them so I don't want to be a jerk about something I don't know about.  But from what I've seen of our current dog he was never trained properly early and has ended up being what he is.  Which is fine as long as he's by himself.  But trying to introduce a new dog to  the mix seems like a bad idea.  

Looking for opinions on whether to give in and get another dog?  Would he be ok with a puppy as long as we paid attention and really tried to help make sure they were ok?

It's made of durable plastic and has a spring-loaded handle for easy scooping. It also has a built-in bag dispenser so I can easily dispose of the waste. I'm just wondering what you guys think of this product, or if you have any other recommendations for a good pooper scooper.

916,dogs,"I know the whole adopt don‚Äôt shop debate and how you really shouldn‚Äôt buy from breeders unless you know they are good breeders who takes care of the dogs they breed, doesn‚Äôt over breed them, and check both the female and male dogs for health problems before actually breeding them. 

This isn‚Äôt really up for debate on the whole shop instead of adopt. We have saved dogs from shelters before and they were some of the best pets we‚Äôve ever owned. But this was while living with my in laws while our house was being worked on. So the dogs weren‚Äôt really ‚Äúour‚Äù dogs they were more my in laws dogs, and they weren‚Äôt actually in our house. 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
Here‚Äôs the deal, my husband isn‚Äôt huge on pets in the house, because the dogs his parents had recently, had really bad health problems causing them to have bad stomach issues, and since they were from a shelter they were older dogs who didn‚Äôt have any training. So he associates those dogs with every dog. His parents weren‚Äôt the best teaching them or training them so it got messy at times. My husband is a stickler for cleanliness. 

He did however grow up with a miniature dachshund, that passed away only 2 years ago and he‚Äôs been heart broken over it ever since. Let‚Äôs call the dachshund ‚ÄúEd‚Äù. Ed was elderly by the time he passed away and so he started having bladder problems and had to wear a diaper. My husband allowed Ed into our home and never minded if he had bladder issues while in our house because he loved him so much. 


MAIN POST: We have an 8 year old son who is having some trouble reading and is a bit behind for his age group. My son has been dying for a dog. My husband and I sat him down and told him if he can get caught up on reading and be able to read completely by himself, that we will get him a little dachshund puppy. 

It HAS to be a dachshund because it‚Äôs the only one my husband will consider right now (I‚Äôm hoping to show him if you take care of the dog correctly, groom it, and train it, that almost any dog can be as good as ‚ÄúEd‚Äù. But I‚Äôll have to start with the dachshund first). So I‚Äôll appreciate anyone who will tell me to adopt from a shelter instead of buying from a breeder, but in this one case it‚Äôs just not an option, at least for now. 

My question is, if you‚Äôre going to buy from a breeder. How do I vet a good breeder and filter out the bad ones? Is there a website where people verify the breeders? Like to make sure everything is on the up and up? I refuse to buy from a puppy mill no matter how cheap or fast I may be able to get it. If I‚Äôm going to buy I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs atleast a moral, ethical place. We don‚Äôt need it right away so I am willing to wait for the right breeder. 

I also wanted to add, in case anyone is curious and/or worried, we have a huge back yard for him to be able to run around and play and it‚Äôs fenced in. He will have a full half acre to run around and be free. He will be an inside dog obviously. I‚Äôve been watching thousands of dog training videos (I watched them anyways before the possibility of getting a dog of our own, just because I enjoy watching them) and I already have a great trainer on hand to help me out. 

I am a stay at home mom, so the dog will always have company and companionship, and it will give me company as well haha. I know purebreds are known to have health issues and we have the time and money for any potential vet visits, and are prepared for that possibility. We also are really good friends with our in laws regular vet and have a good relationship with them, so I trust she will take good care if anything ever happens. 

TL;DR: My husband isn‚Äôt very fond of pets, except for a miniature dachshund because he grew up with one and it died 2 years ago leaving him devastated. Anyways we promised our 8 year old son if he does better in school we will get him one. It HAS to be a miniature dachshund though, as that‚Äôs the only one my husband will consider. I refuse to pay or buy from a puppy mail, no matter how cheap or easy it may be to get it from there. So I‚Äôd like advice on how to filter out the puppy mill breeders and only buy from someone who is known to be an ethical breeder, who checks the parents for health issue before breeding them, and not over breeding the females. Is there a website for something like that?

924,dogs,"I hope this is the right flair.

I adopted my dog 7 years ago. He was a street dog from Taiwan. He looks a LOT like an American Eskimo (fox-like looks, triangle ears, white fur, dark almond eyes), but has very soft, fine, medium to long length fur with pantaloons, feathering, and a plumey, non-curly tail. We guessed he was an American Eskimo (or some similar dog like a Japanese spitz) + Papillon for the fur growth pattern. 

I got an Embark test done out of curiosity and he came back as 100% Formosan Mountain Dog aka Taiwan dog. He is from Taiwan, so it is geographically correct, but I haven't seen a single photo of a FMD that looks like him. He doesn't have a black spotted tongue, the coarse, short double coat, or a sickle tail. A lot of the FMD pictures also had longer ears and seemed narrower in the body (although perhaps he would look more like that without his fur, it's hard to say, but some of the FMDs had very tall ears).

But I know my BF feels the same about his. It makes me really miss the kind easygoing dog I had previously who passed away. I have to constantly be on alert with my dog, and it‚Äôs hard to take him out to do anything fun- let alone find a dog sitter. But I love him with all my heart. Losing him would destroy me.

I‚Äôm really at a loss and I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs not fair for them to spend their life isolated or us to be constantly living in stress or fear when this was supposed to be a really exciting time in our lives. I guess I‚Äôm just venting because I don‚Äôt expect anyone to have a solution, there is none. Even with more training it‚Äôs bound to happen again at some point with both of their dominant personalities. We knew this could turn into a problem, which is why we‚Äôve waited so long.

930,dogs,"My dog is no stranger to licking his body parts raw and this time it‚Äôs on the base of his tail. About the size of a quarter and it has been healing to a scab pretty smoothly with the use of an E-collar. 

Made a trip to the vet for totally different purpose, vet tech calls and says they noticed the scab on the and asks if I‚Äôd to shave the surrounding areas to help it heal faster. Why not so I accepted and paid additional for the service. Picked him up not too long later, he seems pretty normal and not in any distress. Once we got in the car and drove, oh boy, he starts whimpering, crying, pacing back &amp; forth. It was like he was in deep pain.

Once I got home I took a look at his tail and noticed that the area was clean shaven, however, the scab was entirely gone. It could‚Äôve possibly fallen naturally out by itself, or two, the vet tech forced the scab off causing him to whimper in pain. I did not note any blood but a little redness of the hot spot. That night and all day today he looked depressed, wouldn‚Äôt eat or drink and would go absolutely nuts ramming into me like a maniac, whimpering, shaking, and panting. It‚Äôs hard to see my dog in pain like this.

I did call the vet tech who previously handled him and she did confirm that he was an angel during the service, perfectly fine and they in fact did not force the scab off. I told them what my dog is experiencing now and she seems puzzled to why. I don‚Äôt know if I should‚Äôve pressed her for more info or not but I‚Äôm just as confused to why my dog is behaving this way.

Is it possible that the hot spot wound opened again and now it stings? Or does he just hate his tail shaved?

My dog got neutered today. I took him out to go potty in my backyard and without thinking let him go down the few small steps to our backyard. It's just two steps and they are short, but I realized I should have picked him up. Will he be okay? Should I call the vet?

939,dogs,"I returned my dog to the shelter after 9 months of trying to work with his behavior issues. He was a velcro dog who wouldn't let me sit still without barking and nudging me for attention. He'd also steal and chew up everything I owned. I had tried everything, exercise, meds, long walks, training, toys, and nothing worked. There was small progress, but he just wouldn't let me sleep at night. I didn't want to give up on him, but it was taking a mental toll on me. I loved him so much, but he was making my life hell.

I finally gave up after he barked in my 3 year old nephew's face.  He loved my nephew, so I was so crestfallen. That night he accidently bit me while I was trying to wrestle my shoe from him. And then he just wouldn't let me sleep.

I returned him 2 days later and it crushed me. Despite everything he was my baby. I miss him so much. His little webbed feet. Those floppy ears. The way he'd do a frog squat when he wanted to play. I keep thinking of him in that kennel, alone and scared, wondering where I am. I still have some of this chew toys.

I recently got an adult dog and he's not exactly comfortable with my fingers in his mouth and all. So my friend recommended the TropiClean clean teeth gel that requires no brushing for the time I get him used to us playing in his mouth.

The ingredients are: water, naturally derived alcohol, glycerin, artificial peanut butter flavour, mild cleanser, carbomer, green tea leaf extract, zinc chloride (0.01g/10ml)

942,dogs,"We were told from the foster that she fit perfectly in a 36"" crate, so when we got her, that's the size we got. She *does* fit in the crate, and she can turn around, but she cannot stand up straight or stretch her legs in front or behind her. It didnt seem to bother her but it bothered me, and recently some family came to visit and made a comment (politely) that she looks a bit cramped in there. 

We got her a 42inch crate and this thing is huge. I am feeling like we made a mistake trading her old one for this new one. She is potty trained so we arent concerned that she might go to the bathroom in the crate - it's more just for her to have a safe space since she's an anxious dog.

I have a baby gate in the hallway separating the kitchen and living room from the rest of downstairs, and another baby gate at the top of the stairs (I also have a toddler). So there is plenty of space in the house for the cats that the dog cannot get to. I have four cats and two of them regularly hang out within sight of the puppy which always gets him riled up. They don‚Äôt usually come past the hallway gate but sometimes they do. Also, puppy can jump over the hallway gate but usually I stop him before he does. Mostly he either jumps at (but not over) the gate repeatedly or he just stares intently at the cat and barks if the cat moves at all.

I have another dog who is 6, she didn‚Äôt used to chase the cats but now she also gets riled up when the puppy does and barks at the cat too. About a week ago the hallway gate was left open by my husband and both dogs cornered one of the cats. My husband managed to pull them off her and got heavily scratched in the process. She was ok and it hasn‚Äôt changed her behavior at all but it worried me and could have been much worse. This cat attacks when cornered but my other cat who likes to come downstairs is very passive and freezes when he gets cornered so I‚Äôm particularly worried about him.

What I‚Äôve been doing is calling puppy over to me in the other room every time he starts fixating on one of the cats. As long as he is behind the gate he always comes and I give him a treat and then attention. But as soon as I stop giving him attention he goes back to the cat. We repeat a few times and then I get tired of it and usually escort the cat back upstairs after doing. Sometimes I put him in his crate for a while, which he doesn‚Äôt mind.

Today I brought puppy and cat into my office and closed the door. I had puppy on a leash a few feet from the cat and he was very stiff, alert, staring at the cat. It was impossible to get his attention at all even when waving a treat in his face. I backed up to about 5 feet from the cat and I was able to get his attention calling his name and get a sit. I kept doing this and giving him treats but as soon as I stop he immediately goes for the cat again. We did this for about 10 minutes and then I let the poor cat go back upstairs.

I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm doing is helpful. I want the cats and dogs to be able to co-exist. My previous dog who died last year was very friendly with the cats and used to snuggle up with them. We always had the stairs gate mostly to keep the dogs away from the cat litter boxes and cat food, but I hate having to have the hallway gate and have my house so divided and so much less space for my dogs. Is there anything else I can do? Is this something that will calm with age?

I also am going to try and get him more exercise, we haven‚Äôt been walking because it‚Äôs winter (but I have a fenced yard and he also goes to dog daycare 3x a week). Going to suck it up and start walking in the cold as long as it‚Äôs not icy out. I am not sure if that will help though.

951,dogs,"We‚Äôve had our girl for around 7 months now, and we were insanely lucky to get such an amazing dog from a rescue. No reactivity, complete social butterfly and all round good girl. Except for one thing. She‚Äôs a poop eater, and I did not prepare for this. When I was dog walking, poop eaters were my least favourite part of the job. Now, here I am emotionally attached to one. It started with cat poop, then she found goose poop. However, today she found human poop and I watched her eat it, tissue and all, without a care in the world. By the time I‚Äôd run off trail to stop her there was nothing but remnants. Today was the final straw. I know it‚Äôs not her fault, and I don‚Äôt want her to lose her off leash privileges, so I need to get my ass in gear and muzzle train her. 

I‚Äôve seen some boujee looking ones on the internet, but I‚Äôm looking for something easily cleanable, because she‚Äôs probably still going to stick her face in any poop she can find. It would also be good to get something relatively comfortable, as she could be wearing it for 2-3 hours at a time while out on the trails. I‚Äôm also worried about her snagging it on something in the forest. She loves to follow scents and regularly runs round at a million miles and hour, with very little special awareness. The last thing I want to do here is to inadvertently endanger her. So, fellow guardians of poop eaters, what muzzle is your weapon of choice?

I am dog sitting a relative‚Äôs puppy this week that is a ‚ÄúNative American Indian dog‚Äù they paid over $2000 for. It is 3 months old and they have had the dog for approximately one month.

961,dogs,"Hi all,

I imagine you've heard it all before, but I'll share my story anyway. Part of this is catharsis and getting my head straight.

My father-in-law died 4 years ago and my wife (31 at the time) was distraught. She still is. She's always loved dogs and wanted one for the 14 years we've been together, but the situation was never right. Finally, we had the means and time to make a dog happen, and while I am not a dog person, she is great with dogs, was brought up with them and I thought it would help the healing experience.

We got an 8-week Golden Retriever from a reputable breeder and for the first few weeks everything was fine. 'Fine' in that we dealt with normal issues -- toilet training accidents, barking at night, nipping at heels, chewing furniture, finding it hard to settle to sleep etc. All irritating but reasonable and expected enough. She came along very fast with training (toilet training was pretty much perfect by day 3) although she is easily distracted when outside or with anyone besides us.

At 13 weeks old, she starts resource guarding and my wife gets a small bite that draws blood. We'd taken her to training classes once the vaccinations had kicked in, but now we get behavourists in to get her looked at. We are now at 8 months old (36 weeks) and it has just gotten worse and worse. Both of us now have scars from bites that have drawn blood. We've spent thousands -- taken her to the vets to rule out physical pain (though we are taking her again tomorrow) and had her stools examined -- all clear. We've seen behavourists pretty much constantly for the last 5 months, trying to do whatever it takes to make her feel at ease. We've seen positive reinforcement, force-free trainers, I don't care for dominance theory or nonsense like that. We're on our 4th trainer now after going through a few to get different opinions and land on one we like... and she's referring us to someone more experienced.

Generally, it's when I'm looking after her alone. I never, ever take stuff from her, or get close to her if she's playing with something. I daren't even walk behind her in case she thinks I'm up to something. We drop treats as we walk by and make a big deal about giving her new stuff and never taking away.

I'll ask her to do something she doesn't like (generally 'bed' to go in the crate) and then she just goes nuclear if I attempt to do ANYTHING, including backing away slowly. Barking, snarling, spit flying, all gnashing teeth and swiping claws jumping in my face. It's genuinely terrifying. She is trying to bite like mad. Sometimes we have good days where she keeps to herself, but often we have days where I can't do anything with her. We try to do enforced naps, 1 hour up, 2 down, but if I can't get near her she just gets madder and madder and more and more tired until my wife arrives home. The behavourist has said to leave her alone when she's like this, but sometimes I need to get past her to go into the kitchen, or the toilet, and I am being backed into a corner. I am wearing thick clothes at all times on the chance she goes nuts. Today, she drew blood through two layers of thick clothing -- she found purchase on to my elbow and shook her head around like crazy. We used to have guests and babysitters -- we can no longer have either as I cannot guarantee their safety. So we never get to go out together. We just stay in (besides the two walks), day after day with an aggressive, not-very-affectionate dog, unless one of us goes out and leaves the other alone with the dog. It's not fun. We knew the adolescent period would be trying... but every dog owner we know has said they've experienced nothing like this. We send videos to the behavourists who say we are doing the right thing and that it's very odd for the dog to act in this way. It could be diet, they say -- we've changed that. We've amended our behaviour in line with their recommendations. We've purchased nutra-calms, and my wife bought some calming air spray thing. Nothing makes any difference. And it's been months.

We're at our wit's end. My wife can't deal with the stress of leaving me alone with her to go to work, and I can't deal with being attacked on the daily. My wife has been in contact with the breeder periodically to check in and give progress updates, but today has told her she is seriously considering giving her back. None of the owners of her 7 siblings have reported any problems like this (the breeder also kept one which is fine). I feel awful, I actually cried for the first time in about 14 years (I am a husk who didn't even cry at my wedding so this is a biggie). I am not a dog person and yet the thought of giving her up makes me feel terrible. I have been nothing but kind to this little (31 kg!) dog whom I love. Our marriage is suffering and I hate to think of driving away from the breeders (inevitably she'll be nice during the goodbye cause she likes new people being around), never to see her again. I've been watching old videos of when we first got her and she was playful and sweet, welling up and just feeling like the biggest failure. I guess the only consolation is, since we didn't get her from a shelter, she wouldn't be put down if she goes back. I want to keep her but my sanity is fraying and I'm pretty sure my wife has already snapped.

I used to really look down on people who gave up dogs. How could you do that to your family? And yet here I am, seriously considering the same. I would tough it out if I was on my own but my wife has said she has lost hope and cannot continue. I can't keep the dog and expect my wife to stay sane, I don't want to do that to her, yet I want the dog to go to a loving home with people who are experienced and better able to deal with this than we are. If we do this, then that's it, no more dogs. I won't do this to another one.

I'm not really asking for anything, just if anyone has any similar experiences, I'd love to hear them.",t2_5rdrq7o,0,Considering returning highly aggressive 8-month golden to breeders,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,104e8o0,True,Zerokid24,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/104e8o0/considering_returning_highly_aggressive_8month/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/104e8o0/considering_returning_highly_aggressive_8month/,2479178,1672962168,0,,False,1672962181,1672962182,2023-01-05 23:42:48,,,,,

963,dogs,"We are crate training our 1.5 year old gsd/pitt/boxer/belgian mix because she has a barking problem when we're not home (see my last post). It feels like the much more humane option than putting her on medication (which we have as a backup but I don't want to be using it daily)

It's going well, so far we've been able to have her in her own room in her crate for 2 hours with no whining, barking or anxious behavior. We've been increasing time by about 15-30 min every couple days. 

I just feel SO guilty doing it, like I'm making her feel like we don't want her around us when we're home. I also worry she's bored or sad in there. I watch her on the furbo and she looks so bored. 

When she has free roam of the house she can play with whatever toy she wants, play with her brother, and sleep wherever she wants.

I put a few toys in there with her but aside from sleeping and chewing on her dog bark stick she doesn't have much else to do and I feel so bad.

I'm going to move our alexa in there and put quiet classical/calming music on for her while we're gone, but I still worry that's not enough. 

Am I just overthinking it? Is there anything else I can do to make the crate a better place or is calm and quiet as is the way to do it?

966,dogs,"Hi all!

We've recently rescued a 6-7 month old puppy from Cyprus (we're in the UK). We've had her for 3 weeks (the same amount of time she's been in the country). Poor dear went from 20C Cyprus weather to rainy cold Britain üòÖ

She's settling really well! Play fighting with our other dog, recall is good, and she's beginning to learn basic commands.

However... Since day 1 she refuses to toilet outside.

We let her out every few hours but she just sniffs around the garden until she's bored and sits, waiting to go back in. We stay out there for 20-30 minutes. Then she'll come inside and use a puppy pad.

Last week we took her with us to the pub. We were there for 3-4 hours, so took her outside as soon as got home. Again, nothing, but she went on a pad as soon as we came inside. No accidents in the pub either.

Same issue in the morning as well.

So she's very consistent on only going on the pads! And we give her a ""wee wee"" command every time she goes, as well as giving her the command outside as well.

We've even tried putting the puppy pads outside to encourage her - but no joy.

Any tips/advice to get her to go? I'm being patient as she hasn't been with us long, but keen to increase her training. She's smart, and I know if she goes even once outside she'll get it!

My wife met the dog first, and he was very friendly with her instantly. However, when I tried to say hi to the pup, he let out some loud howl/barks and sank to the ground. I gave him space and offered my hand to sniff, and after a minute or two I was able to pet him all over and he was very sweet. However, everytime I went to pet him again, he would always sink down low (tail was wagging).

We don't have much knowledge about his past, but it definitely seems like he had a male in his past that made some kind of significant imprint on him, whether or not it was abusive.

970,dogs,"I‚Äôve been so frustrated lately with the experience I have been having &amp; would really like insight from any others!!!

So, just for background info, I own a service dog, she‚Äôs a 6 yr old Husky/GSD mix, owner-SD trainer tandem trained. She‚Äôs extremely maternal for a dog that‚Äôs never had a litter, and she‚Äôs incredible at helping train/rear puppies, having successfully helped potty train and correct 2 puppies. One of the puppies (now an adult; Husky/Blue Heeler) lives with us again after moving away for a bit, and everyone gets along nicely. 

My roommate and I have come across so many lost dogs recently. Someone I knew had shared that they couldn‚Äôt care for a puppy they found right before the freeze, so I took him in with plans of finding him a home after the freeze. He was less than 8 weeks old (around 5-6) with extremely rough pads for his age &amp; a severe case of roundworm. I have paid out-of-pocket for all his care. Luckily I had a bag of puppy food I‚Äôd planned to donate, but his kennel, bowls, toys &amp; vet bills have added up. I had money saved so I was able to help him, but I‚Äôve reached out to various groups to get assistance with him and have not received any assistance.

Last week, we found another small dog wandering around my neighborhood. We went to check his microchip status &amp; he wasn‚Äôt chipped. He was older, and since we‚Äôd checked his chip &amp; asked around the neighborhood/neighboring apartment complexes, we decided to just drive him to the shelter &amp; ask about the puppy. 

When we were there, they told us they couldn‚Äôt take walk-ins &amp; that we‚Äôd have to go home and call the dispatcher to pick them up. Then we saw a man who‚Äôd been kicked out yelling outside about how they‚Äôd unalived his dogs even though they‚Äôd told him he had until today to pick them up. Ended up stopping to console the guy and it was really heartbreaking &amp; traumatizing.

We drove to a non-profit no-kill shelter across town and asked about both dogs. They also didn‚Äôt allow walk-ins, but told us to pull up to a DIFFERENT shelter the next day, as they took walk-ins after a medical/temperament exam &amp; fee on a first-come first-serve basis for puppies and small dogs. Kept the older dog overnight. Four dogs in the house. 
Woke up at 6 am to wait in line for 4 hours to get the dogs placed, turns out they don‚Äôt 
take puppies under 8 weeks. Older dog gets a spot, I pay the shelter fee, he‚Äôs safe. Puppy, 6 weeks old, doesn‚Äôt have options.

I have, like I said, tried to reach out to so many programs/organizations. While I‚Äôd like financial assistance, I don‚Äôt mind paying for the puppy‚Äôs care. I mostly just want assistance placing him! Was told by one org i‚Äôd have to surrender him and he‚Äôd stay at the shelter prior to placement. While I‚Äôm trying to find him a home, I don‚Äôt think he should have to be sheltered for an unknown amount of time, especially as this specific org has a medical/neonatal foster program anyway for dogs his age (which is why I‚Äôm so frustrated, as the second org that turned us away &amp; misinformed us on where we could take him). 

While my dog loves puppies, and I‚Äôd love to keep him, having three bigger dogs in our current space is not feasible long-term. If we had a bigger space, or I had the chance to prepare him for SD work i would keep him, but my dog is still young &amp; works well &amp; likely will for a few more years. 

Is there any advice in dealing with trying to rescue a found pup &amp; having pushback? I‚Äôd planned on volunteering to foster puppies with the neonatal program &amp; am now extremely disheartened by their process. Even orgs I have existing connections to haven‚Äôt acknowledged correspondence.

Dogs deserve so much more. Having savings &amp; being able to take time off meant all the difference in the care of the dogs I‚Äôve found &amp; their futures.

971,dogs,"4 months ago, I went to the vet to get my dog's teeth cleaned. She is a 6 year old Korean Jindo mix. At the time, I was told her teeth were healthy, with just some tartar build up, which was cleaned.

Today, I noticed one of her front, bottom teeth was quite loose. I can't imagine it being a gum issue since I was told her teeth and gums were healthy just 4 months prior. The tooth doesn't seem to bother her at all. She even lets me touch it and move it around.

The vet quoted me $800 for an extraction. Hence my hesitation.

My question is: Is it necessary for the extraction? What are the risks in letting the tooth naturally fall out, as long as it's not causing her pain?

He's happy, he's playful, he's the silliest thing pup I've ever known. I love him to bits!! He's become quite the little teenager, but I love how his personality is emerging! 

But... I really don't like the breeder. At all. They're a highly reputable breeder in the practice for at least a decade (if not longer), but they just treat me like I'm such an idiot. They make me feel like I'm practically abusing my puppy and pushing him too hard for working on basic training with him. We train a few times a day (and we incorporate a little recall/other basic obedience into our indoor and outdoor play sessions and walks), we play several times a day, and he gets lots of puzzle toys, lick mats, chews, etc. We're doing scent games too. 

He seems like a happy puppy to me. Generally big, swoopy full-backside tail wags, lolling tongue, relaxed eyes, constantly asking for belly rubs, leaning into me/other people he trusts, as polite as possible for a puppy, he just seems like what I'd expect a normal, happy puppy to be like.

990,dogs,"

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * no, this will be our second who will live alongside our 1.5 year old English working cocker spaniel.

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? 

    * we will be using a reputable breeder as we have a 5 year old son and a baby (rescues where we live will not place a dog in a home with children under 12).

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * gets along well with other dogs and children. Our cocker absolutely loves other dogs and is super friendly so it would be ideal to have another that gets along well with him. Needs to be able to go for long walks, we do a lot of hiking through spring/summer/autumn. The dog wouldnt mind living in an apartment- we live in an apartment that doesnt have a garden but i take my cocker to my local woods and to the dog park daily (we're currently home hunting for somewhere with a garden and preferably more rural but there's a shortage of affordable housing where we are from so its probably going to be a while before we find something).

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * I've always loved spaniels (hence we own one already) and my partner has always loved goldens. I have more knowledge about owning and training gundogs than I do any other type of dog. I love pointers and setters too but I'm worried about the size of a golden/pointer/setter in an apartment. My partner also really likes dachshunds but I'm worried that one of those would get its back hurt by our spaniel who is absolutely full of beans and would probably jump on it.

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * sit, lie down, wait/stay, retrieve, bark to be let out to the toilet, go to bed, to walk offleash with excellent recall, 

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * no

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * I am a stay at home parent so there is always someone at home for the dog, when training my cocker I did so in intervals throughout the day and he is exercised for 1-3hrs a day. He's always with myself or my partner doing whatever we're doing. I'd plan to do the same with the next. 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * 1-3hrs a day. Long walks through the woods and hillwalking/hiking, walks at the beach, and going to the dog park. Occasionally walking through the city.

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * don't mind

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * I care less about size and more about temperament, but obviously don't think an XL dog would live well in an apartment.

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * I don't want a yappy dog, barking I don't mind. I'd prefer less slobber but it's not a deal breaker. Shedding isn't a worry.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * very important as I take my dog out into woodland &amp; countryside off leash daily.

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * snuggly

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

    * eager to please but don't mind either way
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * my cocker is trained to go to bed when he hears someone knock on the door. I'd prefer they stay there until greeted by visitors too although this is still a work in progress with my cocker who immediately wants the attention of anyone who walks into our house and will bounce about until they give him attention.

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * no

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

    * excessive barking/whining.

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * Almost never. Two hours once a week at the absolute most.

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * I prefer gundogs, my partner likes goldens and dachshunds (purely for how they look). My partner is equally involved in training and looking after the dogs.

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * English working cocker spaniel

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * we have two children, a 5 year old and a baby.

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * we rent with no restrictions, looking to buy soon. 

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * UK. Aware of banned breeds.

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * last summer the temperature was 18-22c, this winter has been between -7c and 3c.

    **Additional Information and Questions**

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

992,dogs,"... this has to be the silliest sentence I've ever written, yet here we are.

I have a 8 month old labrador who used to constantly pull when taking a walk (I was honestly surprised at how strong she became). This made it painful to walk her, in the long run: I'm a fairly large man so I can handle it but the constant zig-zagging pulling made it so that my lower back hurt terribly, and it's dangerous to both of us as well. My wife did try to walk her but it's much harder for her; our kids just cannot handle her, even using both hands.

Soooo I did a bit of reading on teh internets on the topic and found a tip about switching directions as soon as she starts pulling. I tried that and, after a somewhat short walk, she got the message! Walking did not become great but it did become _okay_, good enough to spare my lower back, in any case. I figured things would improve as she got older, as many other things do.

But then the snow came.

It's as if a portion of her brain just reset. As soon as snow arrived, she started zig-zagging all over the place as she used to do. I then spent yet _another_ terrible walking session of walking back and forth... to no avail, this time. I did the same thing on the next walks... to no avail.

It might not be the snow - puppies gonna puppy - but when we had somewhat warmer weather for a few days and snow thawed a bit, she somehow remembered how to almost walk normally. No(t much) constant pulling! Yay!

... and then snow came back a few days ago, it's here to stay, and we're back to square one.

So I'm in a tight spot, here: I'm the only one who can realistically walk the beast until things improve drastically, but it's killing both my lower back and my patience, and I simply can't wait for the snow to be gone for good. She NEEDS these walks, obviously, but then I'll need to invest in a chiropractor or something. I've tried some other techniques - others suggested stopping the walk as long as there's tension on the leash, but I've tried this numerous times and it's useless: she'll either pull for as long a required for me to give up or simply switch directions. (Fun fact: I did count once, and I had to stop **94 times** in just over 30 minutes. Fun times.)

994,dogs,"**Introduction** 

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

* Yes! This will be my first dog. My boyfriend has trained service dogs, but I have never owned a dog. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? 

* I would like to go through a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog. 

* My ideal dog is one that is trainable, friendly, and good with people. I would love a mid-size dog (anywhere from 40ish-70ish pounds). I also am looking for one that is good with cats. I would love to be able to take my dog on longer walks/jogs, go to the beach with it, and hikes in the summer. I'm looking for a companion, best friend, and travel buddy to add to my small family (my boyfriend, myself, and our little cat). 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I am particularly drawn to Goldens and Bernies; my boyfriend has trained Goldens and loves their temperament. I think Bernies are gorgeous dogs and have heard their temperaments are also loving and friendly, but being a first-time owner and having VERY minimal experience with dogs, I realize my opinion may be skewed/incorrect, so I'm looking for a lot of advice in this area. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* Basic obedience skills; learning to walk on leash, sit/stay/place, respect boundaries/thresholds, and be friendly to other people/dogs.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, I would not be interested in doing this. 

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* A couple of hours a day, especially when it's a puppy. My boyfriend and I both work from home, so pretty flexible on this overall. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* At least 2 hours every day. As mentioned above, longer walks (2 miles or more) and jogs, as well as hikes in the warmer months and frequent trips to a dog park. We also frequently take trips to the beach and would want nothing more than to bring it along! 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I would be open to doing grooming a few times a week, and would have no problem paying a professional to do regular grooming, depending on the needs of the dog. I am also willing to learn about how to properly and safely groom the dog myself at home, when needed. 

**Personal Preferences** 

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Mid size. Anywhere from 40-70ish pounds. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can handle. Barking and slobber, in higher degrees, not as much. I'm ok with barking, but only when it's for a cause. I would want to be able to train the dog to not just randomly bark at anything throughout the day. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

* A combination of both is fine with me. I would love for it to cuddle on the couch with me, but if it wants it's own space, that's also fine. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please would be great! 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I would like my dog to respond calmly and not freak out, basically. This is something I know I would have to train it to do, but I would like my dog to be respectful of guests, visitors, mailmen, etc. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* In the spirit of honesty, I'm not. As a first-time dog owner, I would like to get a breed that wouldn't be aggresive to other dogs. If it turns out my dog is aggressive, I would hire a reputable trainer to help with that, but I'd rather avoid that situation if I can. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I would have a hard time with a breed that requires a drastic amount of mental stimulation, as I just don't think I'm prepared to handle that as a first-time owner. Aside from that, no. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My boyfriend and I both work from home, so we would be with the dog more often than not. For training purposes, we would ensure that we do leave it alone so it is not completely dependent on our presence 24/7, but overall we are home more often than we aren't. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My boyfriend is pretty open to most breeds, but would want to stray away from smaller dogs. He would be VERY involved in caring for and training the dog alongside me, as he is the one with more experience of the two of us and (like me) really loves dogs a lot. :) 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We just have one cat, but aside from that we would never get any other animals besides a dog or cat. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

* No. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* When we get a dog, we will be homeowners, so N/A.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live on the east coast, and at this point I'm not aware of any breed bans. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* Avg. Summer temp: 75-85 degrees. Avg Winter temp: 30-40 degrees. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

 25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I just want to emphasize how excited I am to get a puppy in the future. I plan to take a majority of this year to research breeds, look into reputable and responsible breeders in my area, and just learn about dog training and dog ownership, so I will not be getting one anytime in the VERY near future, which is why I'm filling this out now! :) I am open to any and all suggestions on breeds, advice for first-time dog owners, and really any other information you feel is necessary I need to know going into this.",t2_9ck19se5,0,Looking for some advice on breeds for a first-time dog owner!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üìùRecommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üìùRecommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,10493tx,True,hopeful_evermore,,2,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/10493tx/looking_for_some_advice_on_breeds_for_a_firsttime/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/10493tx/looking_for_some_advice_on_breeds_for_a_firsttime/,2479105,1672950286,0,,False,1672950298,1672950298,2023-01-05 20:24:46,,,,,

996,dogs,"I'm currently feeding my 2 (one very obese, other slightly overweight) senior dogs Stella &amp; Chewys 3 meat raw kibble mix. They didn't lose any weight, if anything they gained weight since being switched in May 2022. I've been researching a bit and found that food is higher in fat due to the raw pieces. Looking at Open Farms website they tell u the serving for less active dogs and realized i've been feeding them more than they should have. The Open Farms senior kibble and the Stella &amp; Chewys raw mix are similar in nutrition so i'm conflicted on what to do. Obese/overweight dogs should have high protein, low cal, low fat, and low carbs and the senior mix isn't necessarily that. But if they're being fed the right amount is it possible they could lose weight on the Open Farm senior kibble? Or should I just look for a weight-loss dog food instead. I like Open Farms due to the quality ingredients and unfortunately it's ridiculously hard to find a good quality dog food without all the bs in it. And does grain-free make a huge difference? I know corn, wheat, soy, etc isn't great but i've read the same about lentils and peas also.

997,dogs,"We have a German shepherd/Australian shepherd.  He‚Äôs 15 months old and I really don‚Äôt see a reason to neuter him.  We have a female beagle who is 14 and spayed.  There‚Äôs another female dog behind us who is 13 and spayed.  All other dogs are male and neutered.  Our back yard is fenced in.

He‚Äôs not aggressive, and he‚Äôs already had his training with a pro dog trainer.  He‚Äôs a sweetie but people need to approach him with a treat and off our property or else he just barks at you because he doesn‚Äôt know who you are.  The trainer said that would probably happen even if he was neutered due to his breed, age, and us getting him when he was just over 2 months old.  But we take him to Home Depot or Lowe‚Äôs, he‚Äôs super friendly to everyone.

Just looking for opinions.  Husband and I are leaning towards no.  Also, we do plan to get another dog after my beagle passes (hopefully no time soon, she‚Äôs still energetic and kicking it) but not right away as we are expecting our first child in July.
