3,dogs,"A helpful tip.

Been out on the beach practicing recall on a long line with my pup recently. He's doing well but his main issue is other dogs since he always wants to run over and play, especially if they're chasing something. And unfortunately he thinks every dog is his friend, even if they are very clearly agresssive so we've decided to stop letting him play with random dogs he doesn't know for now.

He's very playful and will usually meet other dogs in a playbow so owners usually aren't in a rush to recall or come and collect their dogs since he's openly friendly. It's absolutely infuriating watching them slowly stroll over.

14,dogs,"Hello everyone!

Tl;DR- How long do you expect the adoption process to take if the dog is in foster care?

On Tuesday of this week I stumbled across the front page of my local newspaper where there was an article about how the animal shelters in my area are over capacity. I got curious because my husband and I recently decided that we're ready for a dog so I went to my local humane society's' website.

I ended up seeing a picture of a dog that jumped out to me and I instantly fell in love with the dog. After reading the dogs bio I knew that it would be a perfect addition to my husband and I. I reached out to the shelter to set up a meeting as I want to be sure that we and the dog would be good together before we fully commit to adopting. The shelter told me that the dog is in a foster home and that in order to set up a meeting we need to submit an application.

No problem- we did the application and submitted it on Tuesday night. I got a call yesterday morning from the shelter saying that we've been approved and that they will pass my contact information to the foster family so that we may set up a meeting. Today I get a call from the shelter apologizing and saying that the foster family has not responded to their calls and emails and that they will be in touch as soon as they have more information.

I will admit that I'm disappointed as I really would love to give this dog a forever home and it looks like the process won't be as smooth as I thought it would be. I am also a bit anxious of the adoption timeline length as I want to make sure that I can be prepared with dog supplies if we do end up getting the dog. The weekend is coming up so it would be the perfect time to get supplies and make sure the dog gets settled in. As a kid my family and I were able to adopt a dog from the shelter day of so I'm unsure of how long it takes now.

17,dogs,"Hi guys, looking at my first dog and like many here need advice on the breed.

I’m a M in 30s in UK looking for small/medium dog, live rural so plenty of fields to walk with a medium sized enclosed garden.

Will be taking it to work most days, the days I don’t arrange for a dog walker.
I’m quite active for long walks and the occasional hike with a dog, would like an energetic breed which will also be happy to relax at home. Willing to train often, lots of excellent training centres near me.

I have breeds in mind that I like, if anyone has advice if any are a good fit, i understand they are all quite different!
I do love the cockers but I know most don’t have an off switch so maybe not the best fit for me.

26,dogs,"I want to do what's best for my dog. Here are the details:

Shes a 2.5 year old border collie/gsd mix. As you can tell just from the breed alone, she is insanely active. 

I lead a pretty active lifestyle so I managed her energy pretty well and I enjoyed it. Bike rides, day long hikes, camping and portaging, runs with a waist leash, swimming - everything my husband kinda hates doing. I also managed her vet appointments, mental training, food and snack orders, gear, etc.

My husband really just took her to the dog park (which to me was kind of horrible for her energy levels - she would rile up all the other dogs and try to get them to chase her). He's also super affectionate with her because he's usually home all day. 

He also has a very supportive family when it comes to dogs. When we went on vacation or needed support, his family would take her on. Shes so high energy that dog sitters often wouldn't take her so we really depended on his family. My family on the other hand - deathly afraid of dogs. I have to keep her on a leash at my parents house. 

He also doesn't travel as much as I do. I travel for work quite a bit.

....

I feel like I know the answer. That she should stay with him. It's just going to be heartbreaking. I also wish he would attend to her energy levels the way she needs, but he doesn't seem to think she requires it as much as she does (?!?) Which baffles me to no end. It's cuz she's usually pretty mellow in the house and is a huge cuddler which he loves. But that doesn't mean she's ok without proper exercise. 

What would you suggest ? My husband wanted the divorce and he wants full custody of the dog  I'm thinking it might even be better to rehome her on a farm or something cuz I really don't want her miserable at home with him. It worked when we were married because we sort of balanced each others pros and cons. Now...I don't think she'll do well with either or us as a solo parent.

27,dogs,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  Yes! This wil be my first dog. My boyfriend has trained service dogs, but I have never owned a dog.   2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I would like to go through a reputable breeder.   3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* My ideal dog is one that is trainable, friendly, and good with people. I would love a mid-size dog (anywhere from 40ish-70ish pounds). I also am looking for one that is good with cats. I would love to be able to take my dog on longer walks/jogs, go to the beach with it, and hikes in the summer. I'm looking for a companion, best friend, and travel buddy to add to my small family (my boyfriend, myself, and our little cat).  4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I am particularly drawn to Goldens and Bernies; my boyfriend has trained Goldens and loves their temperament. I think Bernies are gorgeous dogs and have heard their temperaments are also loving and friendly, but being a first-time owner and having VERY minimal experience with dogs, I realize my opinion may be skewed/incorrect, so I'm looking for a lot of advice in this area.  5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* Basic obedience skills; learning to walk on leash, sit/stay/place, respect boundaries/thresholds, and be friendly to other people/dogs.  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* No, I would not be interested in doing this.  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* A couple of hours a day, especially when it's a puppy. My boyfriend and I both work from home, so pretty flexible on this overall.  8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* At least 2 hours every day. As mentioned above, longer walks (2 miles or more) and jogs, as well as hikes in the warmer months and frequent trips to a dog park. We also frequently take trips to the beach and would want nothing more than to bring it along!  9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I would be open to doing grooming a few times a week, and would have no problem paying a professional to do regular grooming, depending on the needs of the dog. I am also willing to learn about how to properly and safely groom the dog myself at home, when needed.  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Mid size. Anywhere from 40-70ish pounds.  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Shedding I can handle. Barking and slobber, in higher degrees, not as much. I'm ok with barking, but only when it's for a cause. I would want to be able to train the dog to not just randomly bark at anything throughout the day.  12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Not very.  \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* A combination of both is fine with me. I would love for it to cuddle on the couch with me, but if it wants it's own space, that's also fine.  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* Eager-to-please would be great!  15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like my dog to respond calmly and not freak out, basically. This is something I know I would have to train it to do, but I would like my dog to be respectful of guests, visitors, mailmen, etc.  16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* In the spirit of honesty, I'm not. As a first-time dog owner, I would like to get a breed that wouldn't be aggresive to other dogs. If it turns out my dog is aggressive, I would hire a reputable trainer to help with that, but I'd rather avoid that situation if I can.  17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* I think I would have a hard time with a breed that requires a drastic amount of mental stimulation, as I just don't think I'm prepared to handle that as a first-time owner. Aside from that, no.   \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* My boyfriend and I both work from home, so we would be with the dog more often than not. For training purposes, we would ensure that we do leave it alone so it is not completely dependent on our presence 24/7, but overall we are home more often than we aren't.  19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* My boyfriend is pretty open to most breeds, but would want to stray away from smaller dogs. He would be VERY involved in caring for and training the dog alongside me, as he is the one with more experience of the two of us and (like me) really loves dogs a lot. :)  20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* We just have one cat, but aside from that we would never get any other animals besides a dog or cat.  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No.  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* When we get a dog, we will be homeowners, so N/A.  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* We live in NJ, and at this point I'm not aware of any breed bans.  24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* Avg. Summer temp: 75-85 degrees. Avg Winter temp: 30-40 degrees.  \*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I just want to emphasize how excited I am to get a puppy in the future. I plan to take a majority of this year to research breeds, look into reputable and responsible breeders in my area, and just learn about dog training and dog ownership, so I will not be getting one anytime in the VERY near future, which is why I'm filling this out now! :)  I am open to any and all suggestions on breeds, advice for first-time dog owners, and really any other information you feel is necessary I need to know going into this. 26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",t2_9ck19se5,0,Looking for some advice on breeds for a first-time dog owner!

34,dogs,"So I got my rescue dog back in November and he was suffering with diarrhea when I first met him and bought him home. I took him to the vets but they put it down to other factors and not an infection or illness.

However in December I had a severe case of campylobacter which lasted several weeks and required antibiotics and which I'm still needing follow up appointments on. I am vegetarian and also very careful with food prep as I used to work in a kitchen. I can only think I would have got it from my dog. He has also been having diarrhea or very soft poos since coming home and is now eating less, though I suspect je may just be picky.

He has gone to the vets and is healthy in all other respects and he hasnt shown any symptoms other than diarrhea and not eating. The vets asked for a fecal sample to be collected over 3 days, with 2-3 days for results before anything else.

What can I do to help him in the meantime? I know dogs don't typically suffer as badly as humans but I hate to think he's in pain and discomfort whilst I wait.

35,dogs,"My anxious/reactive dog (rescue, 1.5yrs old, working with a behaviorist) and my roommate’s cat got along great for about 6 months — the issue at first was that he was too excited to be around her, after a couple weeks they were peacefully coexisting and sometimes even playing together.

In the fall, we had a couple food-guarding issues. Since then, they’re always separated while he eats or has high-value toys, etc. This week he’s chased/snapped/snarled at her with seemingly no provocation or food involved — for example, leaping off the couch to chase her when she walked by, and snapping/lunging when I brought him inside and she walked toward him. Both of these incidents were at night, if that matters. I’m very confused about what brought this on after months of a seemingly positive relationship. The cat hasn’t been injured, but I’m super nervous about her getting hurt since he’s literally 10x her size.

41,dogs,"Hi everyone! 

So my boyfriend and I just got a lil dog together. He's a 10 year old miniature pinscher/chihuahua mix whose name is Grandpa :) He is blind and a little deaf. While looking for dogs to adopt we knew we wanted an old Chihuahua, I thought it'd be nice and fun to keep a dog in their golden years as they are less likely to be adopted but ofc still deserve to enjoy life! 

Moving on to the issue. I'll start this off with saying I've never had a dog that lives strictly indoors. While growing up we always had dogs that lived mainly outside where we would play with them, feed them and sleep with a dog bed on the porch or in crate inside. I have grown to associate dogs with being dirty all the time (which they are) and smelly (which they are most of the time).

Anyways so... I don't like Grandpa all the much :/ he loves to cuddle, not too energetic and basically never barks but we just don't click. We bathe him once a week but when he starts to get smelly (day 3) I don't like to touch him or cuddle because his smell lingers and it's so nasty! I see him rubbing himself in dirt and once in bird poop (we bathed him after ofc) but who knows what he's in when we aren't watching. 

Also, he will want to sit with me on the couch to be pet, jumping up and stuff but I don't always want to so I will ignore him or put him on the floor until he goes to lie on his bed (which is pretty quickly thankfully). I like to play and pet and cuddle on my own terms and otherwise I will ignore him begging (not crying just pestering) or give a treat or something to distract. So recently my boyfriend noticed that I ignore him at times, I don't pet him too often and push him away. I never told my bf how I felt because he LOVES Grandpa and I love seeing him happy! But also because this could cause a rift in our relationship. I do not want to get rid of Grandpa at all! 

Anyways so my boyfriend noticed my behavior and asked how I really felt about Grandpa 😬 I was honest and said he's okay and I love that he makes you happy but I find caring for him minorly annoying (as with any pet really) but of course we got him together so I will be responsible for him. I said I like to pet and play on my own terms and that when he stinks I don't want to pet him almost at all. He was hurt :( and said ""I like him more than you do. I'd prefer a dog we both can love and are obsessed with"" but in a somber and sad way. I told him it's okay, but kept to myself that I'm learning I'm not much of a dog person. I love dogs but maybe don't want to be fully responsible for one? 

I just wanted to get this off my chest and ask if I was wrong for telling him how I felt? We have been fine since and he hasn't brought it up again. I of course care for Grandpa the same, bathing feeding and all. But him being so sad about how I felt made me regret feeling that way. Am I wrong to dislike this dog? Should I try harder to accept him and learn to love him for my bfs sake? Again there hasn't been a problem but this happened only 3 days ago so.

46,dogs,"I found this sub reddit through searching 'why are dog trainers so judgmental' and found a post from three years ago addressing just this question.  I've joined but can withdraw if I am a bad fit.  You see, I've about had it with people shaming, lecturing, yelling (yes, yelling) at me and generally going out of their way to ruin my and my dogs day.  I have two GSP dogs who are trained to hunt.  They wear tracking/shocking e collars in the field so that if they are after a bird and their reasonable brain has turned off and there is a truck or a predator or a snake I can recall them instantly.  This rarely happens but it has saved both their lives at least once.  If this places me outside the rules I will gladly withdraw.  I understand because I've had hunters and dog trainers insist that I 'light him up' if during training one of my dogs doesn't do as he ought.  These people are clearly controlling assholes who love to win prizes with their dogs and trash talk each other behind their backs.  My pups and I are training on our own now because those jerks were not helping and even traumatizing my dogs.  And most of the dog trainers I know outside NAVHDA and NAFSTRA  and AKC field trials,  are focussed on good citizen behaviors.  Many of them think training dogs to hunt is cruel.  My dogs weren't trained to hunt, they do it instinctively, I only train them to be safe and not eat the birds they find.  Anyway we are looking for a group that can advise about training, where to let dogs run off leash (not dog parks) and how to deal with crazy people who follow us around with their phones videotaping.

50,dogs,"Context here, in September of 2022, my 16 year old pup, Charlie, went to Valhalla. My other dog, Finn, who is blind and deaf really misses him. 

While it was difficult for Charlie to play w/ Finn his last year or so, the comfort Charlie’s presence provided was a huge part of Finn existing as a disabled dog. He has all the love and my support toys he still plays with, his walks and whatnot but his inability to socialize at home with another dog is taking a toll. He goes to daycare a few times a week and loves it - he’s happy and makes all the friends. I’m just not ready to bring a new dog into our family yet. It’s difficult for me to take him independently to dog parks as he has some behavioral issues from his upbringing and tbh, other dogs tend to pick on him - where as with the sitter, he’s in a completely controlled environment and his safety is assured. 

His sitter is incredible and loves him dearly, should anything ever happen to me, he’s even going to be the one to adopt him. TLDR; I’m really struggling with whether or not I should just give him to the sitter now - who I know would happily take him and he’d always have other pups around. 

He’s been my other 1/3 (now 1/2) for 4 years now since I adopted him, it would break my heart to give him up and change my entire life tbh.

I also dog sat my uncle's dog for two weeks back in November. Each dog has thrown up either after being in my apartment or while they are in my apartment.

I washed the water and food bowls and give them fresh water and food so I do not think it is that. I had a mouse problem and an exterminator in, but he knows I have dogs and only put one trap with rat poison in a closet that I always keep closed so there is no way the dogs can get to that trap. I have checked and there is nothing on the floor that the dogs are eating. I also have my apartment cleaned once a week, and the person who cleans it does not like heavy chemicals.

56,dogs,"I'm already five months into a one year research program that's key for my career. My four dogs are being taken care of by a family member who will he home sitting for the whole period. They have already taken the dogs to the vet when needed, followed treatments schedules and everything that's necessary to keep them in good condition. 

The thing is, I miss my dogs dearly(it gives me serious anxiety), and through the cameras set up in their (the dogs) room I see that two of them look a little depressed, not as jumpy and eager to play as when I was there. They haven't stopped eating or anything medical, it's their mood that worries me. 

With some effort (I'm in a totally different continent) I may be able to go back home for a week to be with them and play, maybe bring them some new toys, etc, but I don't know if that's actually better for them.

60,dogs,"So my mother bought a Bichon Frisé on impulse about a few months ago; I named him Yuki and he’s around 10 months old. My brother and parents have always wanted a dog but never had the space but since we moved we do now have that and so mom decided to buy one without really consulting us.

This resulted in the current situation; I hear Bichons are active and love playing but my mom and dad both work and can barely spend time with him, not to mention that they have a hard time keeping up with him. My brother and I have Highschool and college so we both can’t be with him either, and when we can I am basically the only one who plays with him for long just to make sure he isn’t bored.

For most of the day, he’s left in his cage because otherwise he breaks a lot of stuff. In total it’s around 9PM-4PM, maybe he’s let out once during that for a bit. He doesn’t have toys either since he’s somehow broken all of them and he just chews on his bed.


I suppose I’m just asking for advice since he barks a lot in the cage and cries sometimes and I feel super bad for him.

So, in the post that was deleted I advised someone to use negative punishment to condition the no-marker and I linked to a video. The video was about doing that in conjunction with crate training, e.g. sending the dog into the crate, and when the dog tries to leave the crate without permission, you prevent that by closing it and saying „no“ or „ah-ah“.

I have a very demanding, one year old Cavachon. 
Since he was a puppy he has been a diva. He is not a people pleaser. He failed puppy school because he knows all the commands but won’t do them. He ignores treats. If you are a human he really likes he will follow commands and do tricks, or if you have something really tasty. Otherwise, you’re ignored.
Daily, he takes all my time. I am a nurse so work long shifts. When I am at work he goes to doggycare. When I am off, it’s all about him. An example of my day:
8am - wake up, take him out in the garden to toilet, feed water. Then feed myself and get ready.
9am: 30 mins- one hour walk in the dog park
10am: wash paws, dry, nap, brush and eye clean
12 noon : he is awake and wants to play, howls barks cries until I play. Fetch, tug. 
2pm: short rest 
3pm: feed him, cook and give boiled chicken and veggies with vitamins cos he has refused dog food
4pm: he wants to play again - play one hour 
5pm - 30 min walk
6pm - make dinner with him at my feet
7pm- eat dinner with him crying at my feet
8pm- he wants play and fuss. Play and fuss until 10pm
10pm- we go to bed, i have to sleep when he does or he cries. He sleeps in his crate or my bed.

Can you please suggest a good breed for a first time dog owner? Some information provided below, for context.

1. We live in Bulgaria, on a 1500 sq meters / 16,000 sq feet plot of land. 
2. Me and my wife plan to have kids in the future, so the dog needs to be very good with kids
3. We would like the dog to have some protective qualities, or at least alert us if someone is entering our property
4. This is not major, but bonus points if the dog can live in it's own dog hut in the yard and not in the house 
5. We live next to the beach and go hiking each summer. We would like to take the dog with us on those adventures and we need a breed that gets along great with other people and animals
6. We are first time dog owners, so a breed that is not too stubborn, is easy to train, obedient, loyal

So, backstory is I have two extremely ruptured discs due to a domestic violence situation in my past. I’ve been doing okay until recently when my dog pushed me down the stairs.

He never listens, we have tried to train him and he’s so dense that we have just given up and accepted that no matter what we do, he won’t listen. (He only listens if we have treats or food, because we trained him with treats.)

He’s always been a pain in the butt, like he will destroy the whole house while we are gone, but this time really takes the cake. I told him to let me come down the stairs, and he was already down them waiting to go outside. He had no reason, but he jumped up and hit me and I fell down the last few stairs.

He made my back have a massive flare up and we can’t afford to go to the ER. The pain is definitely an 8/10 and I have barely been able to move. I’ve been bawling my eyes out. My husband (who is an angel on earth I met after escaping the DV) has been doing everything for me and I feel so guilty.

So how does this fit into posting on this subreddit? Well, I’m so angry with my dog I don’t even want to see him or be near him right now and I don’t know how to get past it. Our cat knows I’m in pain and has been loving on me, and even in pain our dog gets into stuff and tries to jump on me. I can’t go upstairs so I’ve been on a futon downstairs, and he whines and comes and slaps me with his paw so I’ll go upstairs, which isn’t happening. I just tell him to go away. We boarded him a few days, but we can’t afford
to keep doing it. We decided to have him professionally trained now too, but I still can’t get past being upset at him.

What can I do? Am I just a terrible person? I know he didn’t intentionally hurt me… but still. I use to get pushed around and that’s how the original injury happened so he triggered my PTSD on top of hurting my already severely hurt back.",t2_lgx4zhyb,0,Dog seriously injured me,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,103wkby,True,Queen_Orange,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/103wkby/dog_seriously_injured_me/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/103wkby/dog_seriously_injured_me/,2478985,1672917559,0,,False,1672917576,1672917577,2023-01-05 11:19:19,,,,,,

73,dogs,"Hey everybody, 
A few months ago we saw my now 11yo catahoula leopard buddy limping while outside playing. 
We gave him time to heal but after a few weeks the soreness/limp wasn't going away. Took him to the vet who told us after xrays they believed it was either osteoarthritis or osteosarcoma.  They explained the process for osteosarcoma and they also warned us of how it spreads even faster in their experience after doing a biopsy to check.

We opted to not do the biopsy and hoped it was arthritis. This is all on his front right paw btw.

Its been several months since then and im 99% sure its the cancer. His limp is full on if not almost lame in the leg now. He doesnt whine or act in pain aside from just not using it, and hes very vocal about pain usually. 

His shoulder or armpit area where it connects to his leg is very swollen.

Otherwise he gets around just fine.

I instantly went into home remedy mode because we didnt want to amputate or chemo. Weve been giving him 2 prescribed pain pills as well as edible doggy hemp treats targetted for hip and join pain relief.
We sometimes apply oxygenated cream to his swelling area as well as mix in tumeric (golden paste recipe) into his food dishes.

He has always been a finicky eater and even when healthy would skip meals for a full day. He does it occasionally now as well but still eats good otherwise.


I guess im looking for any good ideas you all might have to further reduce his pain or relieve any of the inflammation/swelling in his arm. I just want him to enjoy his time he has left. We dread the day we will have to put him down because his brother will be devastated. 

He still moves around, sometimes even runs(not really using his limp leg) and can even hop onto the couch on his own (though we try to prevent so he doesnt fracture anything).


Any ideas? I was considering using a cooling pad or ice pack to cool the inflammatory areas. 


Thanks for any response.

74,dogs,"Hi all. We’ve had our dog Uno since he was about 4 months old, and from the beginning would put him in his crate inside at a night, and he spends most of the rest of the day in the yard, while we’re at work. He always seemed content with it, he went into his crate on his own and would even stay in with the door open. As it got colder I got him a dog house to have some shelter, we keep it on our patio. He’s a really great dog, a cocker spaniel and chihuahua mix, super friendly, doesn’t bark when he’s not supposed to, and trains really easily. I love him tons. Anyway!

The thing is that after about a year and a half he doesn’t love the crate anymore, he sometimes whines for a bit while he’s in there, though he does eventually stop and settle in, but now if I let him out to eat or pee, he goes into his dog house and doesn’t really want to come inside. I mean he literally prefers to be outside in like 50 degree weather in his dog house than be inside. He’s warm in there, we put in blankets and regularly wash them for him, if I do leave him out there for a few hours and go get him, he’s warm to the touch so he’s clearly comfortable. I just wonder why all of a sudden he prefers that.. what can I do?

Oh and we always reward being in the crate. He gets milk bones and greenies in the crate.

79,dogs,"This is a story about how I think my dog has been permanently broken by relentless fireworks over the past month. I fear I will never get him back and that this may kill him. I hope someone has any idea whatsoever to help me save him. Buckle up, this is a long plea.

I live on Oahu, the most populous Hawaiian island, and fireworks are something of an insane tradition here. On New Year's Eve, multiple shipping containers worth of fireworks go off every second for hours all night across the island. It might sound like a spectacular show, but it sounds like I live in a war zone. Additionally, the pre-festivities start on Thanksgiving on some parts of the island, and at least some fireworks will get set off daily. It seems that many of these fireworks focus more on the boom than the light show. They can be terrifyingly loud. It gets worse and worse as New Year's gets closer and lasts until the night after. Some are even set off during the day when they cannot even be seen because people are so impatient. The crazy part is that almost all fireworks are illegal here, but people still have access to ones that literally shake your house and set off entire streets of car alarms.

I have two dogs, a Jack Russell mix and a Fox Terrier mix. Historically, the Jack Russell mix has not been shook the least by fireworks and the Fox Terrier mix has been rather shook by them. To save too long of a story, the Fox Terrier mix doesn't like fireworks, but can tolerate some of them now that he's been on Prozac for over a year. It's good we've been able to get him through this, since he has had a heart murmur now for the last four years and is now 13 years old. The Jack Russell mix has slowly started becoming intollerant of fireworks as he has gone deaf. We noticed issues with his hearing in early 2022 and it's been getting worse since.

Since fireworks are a constant here (Tuesday at 11PM? Random single firework, why not!) we have noticed the Jack Russell mix getting more and more sensitive to them throughout the year. It was fine enough until they became constant after Thanksgiving. At first it was just him being scared and wanting to sit on my lap for a while. No problem, buddy! I've got you. It progressively became stress panting for a couple hours nightly after the first firework. Then it became stress panting for hours as soon as the sun went down because there might be fireworks. Eventually, it progressed to him stress panting for 10-12 hours every night until he passed out exhausted between 2-4AM.

As this progression occurred, he became more and more detached from human help. Sitting on my lap, petting, or any other distraction to help calm him did less and less. Before things got too bad, I even took him to the vet and he was given Prozac as well. He was given the same dose as my Fox Terrier mix and I was told in a couple weeks it should be working. Well, that didn't work in the slightest. In fact, it got worse. By Christmas, he was barely eating breakfast and was only sleeping a couple hours per day. Those hours were only when he was too exhausted to stand, stare vacantly at nothing, and stress pant. The dog that used to love walking miles now would not even go outside unless dragged. I took him back to the vet. His Prozac dose was increased to maximum and he was given toradol. It was too little, too late. He has fully detached from reality. The only thing it seems to have done is give him his morning appetite back so that he at least eats some.

Eventually, even the house became an unsafe space. He now associates the house and the entire neighborhood as the place where booms happen. He is terrified to be anywhere within a mile of the house. He knows every side street in that radius, so it takes driving him out of the neighborhood to begin calming him. That said, it now takes hours outside of the neighborhood to calm him down. I knew I needed to get him out of the neighborhood for the worst of it. On December 30th and 31st, I slept in the back of my car with both of my dogs on the quietest part of the island I know to spare them the anxiety and fear. It worked... For a moment. The Fox Terrier mix was spared two bad nights and seems to be no worse the wear for the season. My Jack Russel mix is still broken when we are anywhere near home, though.

He's smart. He knows where he is. That's how I know it's the house and the neighborhood. He knows the car can take him out of the neighborhood. The only place he will currently willingly go is the car. This behavior pre-dates our two nights in the car. When we stayed in the car those two nights, he knew he was out of the neighborhood well before we got to where we were headed. After he calmed down a bit, he slept... Hard. He slept like he had never slept in his life. All night, both nights. That car was his safe space. I had to give him that. New Year's eve is his true birthday and he deserves that safety from the hell the people here inflict on the island. He turned 14 this New Year's. The only real difficulty? I can't sleep in the back of my car 15 miles from home every night because the dog is broken. He got those two nights and then we had to go back to reality.

It's now an all-day every day affair. If he's awake, he shakes and stress pants until he's exhausted and passes out for a couple hours. His back is hunched up and his posture looks beyond uncomfortable. The sound is unbearable. Not only is it annoying, but more importantly, I know my best friend is in constant fear of existing. That hurts the worst, and I've been in tears more than once. He hasn't heard a firework in 48 hours, but he is terrified. Well, he hadn't, but there were just some that went off outside as I was writing this. He's absolutely detached from reality. He doesn't respond to commands, let alone his name most of the time. He has trouble with the stairs, and sometimes with just plain walking. It seems like he has problems using his tongue or chewing he is so exhausted most of the time.

A couple days ago I decided to try something I think radical (it is for me, at least). I broke down and tried getting him some CBD oil, the non-THC containing kind, at the recommendation of a younger guy working at a local mom and pop pet store. It turns out, that's the only thing that kind of works. Basically, if he's high (I assume that's what it's doing) he can't be terrified. If I give him enough, which is four times the base dose, but still safe, according to the CBD store guy, he lays down and peacefully sleeps in what looks like a normal sleeping pose. He actually looks at peace. So, I get a few hours at a time where he's passed out drugged up so he at least sleeps.

But then he wakes up again. It takes him an hour or so after waking up and he's back to staring at nothing vacantly while stress panting. I cannot get him to break this behavior except for keeping him whacked out on the CBD, so no meaningful change seems to be made.

I beg of anybody that has experience with extreme dog anxiety disorders to please tell me what your experiences were and if you were able to solve them. At this point, I fear that my best buddy is broken forever and I will never see him again. I knew I would lose him someday, but I'm distraught that I'm losing him while he's still alive. I'm crushed.

If you happen to live on Oahu and are reading this, I ask you to please consider supporting stronger enforcement of the fireworks ban. There is no reason for the gross display of lawlessness that occurs here every New Year's.

It's so bittersweet to see her doing these massive zoomies that she obviously can't do where we live, and just having a great time. However,  when we come back to the city she isolates herself, definitely isn't as playful, spends a majority of time in the bedroom instead of out w me like she usually is, still enjoys walks and treats, but it's a veryyy obvious change in her. I try to get her to play some enrichment games and do other things I know she likes but she shows no interest, it feels like doggy depression and it kills me!

85,dogs,"
Long post for context sorry

I'm staying with extended family for a week and am becoming more and more uncomfortable and angry about how they treat their dog

For context they are my mum's relatives in a country where the conventions of dog ownership are different
They live in a house with two wings
One cousin and their family live in one wing with two dogs. These dogs have free reign of the wing and the communal garden. They are labs aged 12 and 2
The other cousin lives in the other wing with their family. They have a golden retriever aged 4. She is confined to a fenced terrace of about 10m*10m

This dog stays on this terrace the whole day and night. We have made a point of going out to play with her daily and she always goes mad with excitement. To our knowledge nobody else ever goes out there. She is left food and water by the gardener as one of his duties. She cries and barks constantly

For reasons I'm not party to she is not allowed to mix with the other dogs - apparently they fight. Today my brother asked the son whether the GR could go into the communal garden and he was granted permission. She was very excited and ran about pushing into people. She and one of the other dogs also started to rough play with some growling, but both tails were wagging. Everyone panicked and was shouting and crowding the dogs. Despite my pleading that they were playing, the GR was forcibly dragged back to her patio within about 3 minutes. I was told off by my mum for apparently sticking my oar in (although I haven't actually stated my feelings to anyone at all)

I can't stop crying thinking about her predicament. She is the sweetest dog and just wants to be petted and to chase her ball. She is only ""difficult"" because she literally never gets to do anything and she is one of the most social, people oriented breeds around. J don't understand why they have got a dog that they don't want to spend any time with and I don't understand why they don't arrange it so that the dogs go into the communal garden on e.g. alternate days

I now feel that I cannot leave without doing something about this. I wish I could just whisk her back home with us and would probably pay the money to do so. However my OH has pointed out that suggesting this would be insulting and probably destroy my mums relationship with her family, who will have put us up for almost a week. We also couldn't keep her and would need to re-home her after her arrival to the UK

He has rehabilitated multiple friends from their fear of dogs; he's been a service animal; he's traveled with me all over the world. He has an amazing sense of humor and knows over 40+ words. He basically played matchmaker between me and my husband 10 years ago. Today we forgot to turn on the heat and he reminded us by pointing at it and making himself a nuisance until we slow humans put 2 and 2 together. 

His bloodwork looks pretty bad today. Steroids have given him a raging UTI. He has a splenic mass that is likely bleeding, making him anemic... yet he has an incredible zest for life. It seems despite this, his body may be failing. Vets keep talking to us about making plans for either chemo (with a dim prognosis) or euthanasia.

Apparently the shelter she was at also puts the dogs in a giant playroom to potty at bad weather, and I think she’s doing it at home too. It’s also not so much that she won’t go outside. She does every time I take her out, which is literally once or twice every hour. The past week all I’ve done is be outside with her. I’ll take her on nice long walks in the park, she’ll pee and poo. When we get back home 20 minutes later, she does her business again on my lawn. And yet, within a half hour of being in the house, there are two giant piles of semi soft stool and a giant puddle of pee. 

I think they gave her deworming medication. I’m mixing new wet food with the dry food to transition. They said that she had a lot of worms and it is warm on the Puerto Rico beaches where she’s from. 

It’s truly hard to describe how often she goes in the house. I’ve never seen anything like it, especially even after being constantly taken outside. 

For example, I just finished cleaning her messes. She ran around outside, went to pee and poo. I let her outside again (I literally let her out every half hour) and she does nothing outside. Within five minutes she takes two dumps in the living room. I’ve thrown out every rug already. Does anyone have any training tips? I spend hours cleaning after her and walking outside aimlessly with her not going. I will be enrolling her in classes but I could use some guidance.

Since she was born she loved to playfully be mean and often initiated playtime by biting your pants or arm or shirt sleeve.   
Over time she started responding to the gesture of me reaching out my hand to pet or play with her, she'd bark and growl, slowly wagging her tail.  
I thought it was aggression at first and got kind of scared, but I realized she just wanted to play, especially considering she'd grab her toy (if it was close), and when I gently pet her or said stop, she'd instantly go into calm mode.  


However, for the last year or so, she barks and growls at anyone for simply walking through the house if she's feeling playful. It's like instinct to her now, almost like everyone is an enemy from a distance, except when they get close she has the same reaction as before.   
It's clear she doesn't view them as a threat because when she barks and growls sometimes she'll roll over so they can rub her belly and stuff.

100,dogs,"We went away for 5 days and left our 9 month old golden retriever with a dog-loving friend who has 9 of her own.  Our pup became besties with her German shepherd, and basically played all day, every day till we got back.  Two things of note took place that I’m still processing:

1.  Our pup lost his feeding frenzy.  Our friends dogs feed at-will, and joining them seems to have broken him of his food obsession.  He can walk by a bowl of food and not show interest, whereas before we left him, he ate so fast and so greedily we’d resorted to a Kong or hand-feeding him his kibble to slow him down.  We’ve kept up the at-will feeding (food is always available), and it’s his new way.  He eats roughly the same amount as before.  Just calmly, and at his own time.  Is this typical of singletons that spend a few days with a chill pack??

Which brings me to…

2.  He doesn’t seem interested in playing with his toys anymore.  All he wants to do is take walks, chase balls and look out the window.  He used to go bananas for rawhide strips.  Now, he still performs the required trick to get the treat, but half the time, he drops it once he gets it!  It’s as though nothing compares to being in the pack at my friends house.  Is he depressed now that he’s back at home with us, since we’re not a pack of dogs that run and play all day??  (He gets plenty of walks, balls thrown off-leash, work to do, and we’re generous with the praise)

119,dogs,"Hi guys,

I re-homed my tiny dog.   
She was highly anxious and I've done everything within my power to help her. Behaviourist after behaviourist, medications, training. I was and am really drained as I had to manage her non-stop.  
This was not an easy decision for me as I obviously love this little dog, I've had her for over 13months and it took me around 6months to make that decision. She was my everything. Having to constantly manage her stressed me out a lot and made me also quite anxious. She never was really human focussed, she always loved other dogs more. I thought it might be good to give her to a family with another dog or two who might teach her how she can relax. I personally would have not been able to take care of another dog, not enough space and also financially.   
After a long time of meeting family after family, I finally found a really good match and re-homed her (I was upfront with her issues, of course). She now has a dog sibling, a massive backyard and is apparently doing really great (within her limitations). The family regularly sends me pictures and updates and I really feel that she is so loved there and will have an amazing rest of her life. I think the other dog is really great for her, they seem to get along really well (I did a couple of meet and greets before I gave her away to make sure they get along). 

Now. What do I do with myself? I feel like I am a failure for not being able to make her feel better and that I had to give her away. I feel like a bad owner. Those who had to re-home their dog, how did you deal with feelings of guilt and emptiness afterwards? My place also feels so empty right now. And my heart feels empty as well.

We would be first time dog owners and are fully understanding of the work it requires to be a responsible owner, but we do have young children at home and are worried about the combined puppy and toddler energy in our household and the appeal of adopting an older dog who may be calmer is somewhat tempting.

125,dogs,"I'm a new dog owner and I fucked up bad, I've been playing fetch with my boy everywhere and yesterday I did it on concrete and not grass (I've done that before and it was fine, he just loves playing fetch no matter where) and he injured his paws real bad, they were bleeding and I immediately called my vet and they recommended that I just clean his paws with antibacterial soap and clean towels and then wrap them which I did by some bandages and they mentioned that if we bring him in that's all they're gonna do too so it's not necessary to take him in. 


This morning I had to take him out for a potty and he stopped after peeing and would not move, had to carry him home and he barely listens to any commands, he seems tired and depressed also the bandages got wet so I changed them. He seems completely out of it, lays in one place and only moves for food and to go out for potty (not even treats anymore). 

Is this normal behavior? Is he just recovering or in pain and not telling us? I got him some CBD treats but I can't tell if they're doing anything for him because he is pretty much the same way he was before (lays in one place, won't listen to any commands)

I just can't tell with my boy because even when he was bleeding yesterday he wasn't making any noises and was just running around so we had to hold him down to clean his paws and put some bandages on but today he just seems depressed and he won't move at all. 

I'm guessing this is normal because he won't want to walk on injured paws but the fact that he is not interested in treats, chew toys or literally anything else is something I've never seen from him so I'm not sure this is normal or not.",t2_5dat9go9,0,Dog got injured and now he seems depressed,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,103mqew,True,Dev_WhoDat,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/103mqew/dog_got_injured_and_now_he_seems_depressed/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/103mqew/dog_got_injured_and_now_he_seems_depressed/,2478868,1672885166,0,,False,1672885179,1672885180,2023-01-05 02:19:26,,,,,,True

She had her first seizure 2 nights ago and another one a night before. I’ve timed it and all. Her first seizure and second lasted about 2 mins. Her first one was worst then the second, she foamed at the mouth, paddled her legs and peed herself. The second time was much less worst then the first, she only paddled and foamed at the mouth a little bit. But last night, she didn’t had a seizure at all. (Thank god) 
I took her to the vet hospital today and had lab work done on her and was given an opinion on what it could be. I was given phenobarbital to start her on today, but I’m skeptic though. None of the lab work has came back yet and yet I’m being rushed to put her on these meds. I don’t know if should start giving them at all since neither I or the vet knows exactly what’s going on with her.

130,dogs,"I have a 11 year old mix breed dog (border collie, with some amstaff, Boston terrier, etc). And my wife and I have had him his whole life. He is our first child in our eyes and we love him dearly. 

The problem is, his behavior lately has been worrying. I have a 3.5 year old and a 5 month old so you can imagine…he’s not really happy. The oldest tries to pet him and play, but my dog tends to bare his teeth and low growl at him as a way to tell him back off. My oldest doesn’t really listen or understand what our dog is trying to tell him. So, we usually intervene right away so it doesn’t escalate. 

Tonight, I went to check on his ears; which he can be sensitive about. Right away he started giving me his usual “back off” look. I give him some pets on the head and he seems to calm so I go to lift his ear flap. That’s when he immediately nips me. It was one of those, “get back, I’m warning you“ nips. He has done some things similar in the past but this one was a little harder than usual. Talking with my wife, we’re now starting to worry that we are seeing signs that it may be time to re-house him. 

However, we’ve been through so much with him that we hate that we’re even thinking about it. He’s had TPLO surgery in both back legs as well as additional surgery to remove the metal rods. He got a bad bump on his ear from shaking it so hard he busted blood vessels and it needed surgery to fix.

As I’m typing this, my son is running around playing and if he gets close to the dog, the dog growls at him. My son isn’t even trying to play with the dog, just running around. The dog, btw, does this all the time but we usually are on stand by in case something goes south.

Out of all this, what is the right thing to do? We don’t want to re-house him but we also don’t want things to go south and one if my kids get nipped or worse. This sucks so much, but what do we do.

147,dogs,"My dog is a 5-year-old chocolate lab. He's very healthy; he just had his yearly checkup and the vet said that he passed with flying colors, which is always nice to hear. He's also the largest purebred lab my vet has ever seen; 93 lbs and almost as tall as a German Shepherd. Behavior-wise, he just can't be around other dogs; he'll be cool for a while, but then eventually freak out and get aggressive (this is why he was given up for adoption), but he's a hilariously loving guy around humans, and great with my kids. 

Sorry, probably too much backstory. My question is - what does it mean when a dog, who is otherwise extremely food-motivated, ignores his food bowl for hours or even a full day sometimes? I feed him twice a day, and sometimes in the morning I'll find that his bowl is still completely full from the day before. Like he skipped breakfast *and* dinner. Then he'll eventually eat it all in one session and then immediately beg to go outside. Is that weird? It seems super weird to me. 

I've changed up his food numerous times. If anything he seems to like the cheapest food (Wegmans store brand) the best, but I assume that's because it's junk food and not great for him. And even with the Wegmans food he usually ignores his bowl.

I’ve used them a handful of times for boarding and I always pack extra food for her, in case there’s an emergency and I need to delay her pick-up by another day. I always write feeding/measurement instructions *on the bag of food* in sharpie. And I tell them “there’s more food in here than she actually needs, but follow the instructions”. About half the time, they give me the food bag back empty…meaning they actually fed her the extra day’s worth of food 🙄. I’ve been miffed but really no harm done.

My boyfriend and I moved last Friday from a house to an apartment with our pitbull who we have had since she was 8 weeks old. She has always been a great dog and I understand how the transition has been difficult for her as she used to roam around freely in the backyard but now must be on a leash at all times outside. We have been consistent with walking her for at least an hour each day, with bathroom breaks inbetween and other kinds of enrichment such as peanut butter kong toys, tug of war, etc. However, the biggest issue we are having is she has developed separation anxiety and can not be left alone in the apartment without barking. We have a camera in the house to see how long she barks for and she pretty much barks until we get back. She never used to bark when left alone while she was in a house. I’ve tried leaving her in the bedroom with the door closed and TV on and that didn’t seem to help. We are extremely stressed because both of us are starting jobs in about two weeks and the dog will soon be left alone for about 6 hours each day, which she would also do while we lived in a house but she never barked as we left. We are very lucky to have about 2 weeks before we start working so I am open to any suggestions at all to get her to not bark the entire time we are gone. I’ve been reading about others putting their dogs on anxiety medication, which is feasible for us as we do have pet insurance however she has never done this until a few days ago when we moved.

176,dogs,"We adopted a 1.5 gsd/pitbull/boxer/Belgian malinois mix in October (we did the embark test, only reason I know specifically). Those are all incredibly smart and active breeds, so it makes sense our dog is too. 

I don't think she has separation anxiety, I fully believe she barks just to bark, she'll walk around the whole apartment just yapping away or at her brother (gsd/pit mix) trying to get him to play. We have a furbo and can track how much she barks, it's pretty much nonstop once she gets going. Eventually she'll wear herself out and nap, but as soon as she wakes up she's at it again.

There is only one day a week where my boyfriend and I are both gone for more than 4 hours. He comes home during lunch to walk them, I come home in between classes. 

She gets a 1-2 mile walk every morning depending on the weather. She gets walked about 4-5 more times throughout the day (some are quick round the building to pee walks, at least one other long one in the evening though). 

When we leave, I give both dogs frozen kongs. Neither of them freaks out when we leave. Usually after 30+ minutes she will abandon the kong and just start her chatter. 

The dogs have lots of toys (not an overwhelming amount) all of which are tough chew toys since she destroys and eats fabric toys. 

I also leave kibble filled balls for her to try and work on. 

I've tried a vibration collar, and I know they're not popular but initially I was actually a very big fan. I put it on myself first (bc I would never do anything to my dog I wouldn't do to myself) and it's like a light phone vibration, doesn't hurt at all. Initially it worked and it would vibrate and she'd be distracted, often trying to figure out where it was coming from. She is now immune to the vibration. Shock collars are not something I want to consider.

I've given her Benadryl to see if it'll make her a little more relaxed (1mg per pound), I don't notice a difference. 

I have box fans by the doors to drown out anyone walking by. We leave calming music or tv on for them when we leave. We also have all the windows covered because she will bark at anyone she sees passing by.

She is in training which has really helped her hyper behavior (jumping, pushing etc) but I'll be honest and say I don't think I've ever seen good training advice for barking when we aren't home that isn't separation anxiety related. If I give her treats every time she's quiet she's not going to know why she's getting them. I don't know how I'm supposed to train her when I'm not home. 

I'm also working on crate training. We're up to her being alone in another room with the door shut in her crate for an hour or two before she starts whining or barking. I'm hoping by the end of this weekend to be able to leave her for a few hours in the crate in her own room, but I can't count on that. (Classes start again next week, thus the timeline)

We're seeing the vet tomorrow and I'm going to ask about medication. I absolutely hate this because I worry about long term effects. 

We used trazadone over Christmas when we had little kids coming over and it worked amazing. She was chill and mellow for about 3-4 hours without being overly drugged or stoned. I'd be fine with using it if there is no harmful effects, or trying whatever calming medication the vet recommends but again so worried about long term effects/safety. 

We live in a small town and doggie daycare unfortunately is pretty much just rover options. She is an escape artist and runner so I while I'm not opposed, I have a very hard time trusting other people to be experienced enough to know how to interact with a dog like this. I'd also only be able to afford it once a week, and I'd choose the long day we're gone for that. 

Is there anything I'm not trying or doing? Anything specific I should ask the vet about? I've had 40+ dogs including fosters, some of which have had severe separation anxiety and it's never been like this. I truly think she's just insanely smart and needs constant stimulation, but I don't know how to do that safely when I'm not home. We have about 6 months before we can move and I'm hoping we'll be able to rent a house so noise wise it won't matter as much, but I have to make this work somehow in the meantime.

177,dogs,"Hi all, 
My adoption application is finally approved, and I just need to sign the contract and pick her up.
But before sending the contract, I just want to make sure everything looks alright. 

I talked to the representative of the rescue, and she seems very nice and caring, but it looks like she doesn’t have much information on this dog, but she’s contacting the foster home to get the information.
On their website, the temperament of this dog is very sweet and gentle, and she doesn’t have any specific behavior problems. But today the representative talked to me that the foster family said that she has some anxiety, especially at night, that she might bark if she hears the sound of wild animals. I appreciate that she let me know and also I don’t really have that kind of problem in my property especially in the winter so I don’t worry about it too much. 

Then I read the contract, and it says the temperament and behavior, and the medical issue of a dog is not their responsibilities, and I partially understand that. I also asked the medical record of the dog, because on their website, the adoption fee includes everything like vaccination, spay, and transportation. I’m still waiting for the reply, though. 
When I talked to the representative said the dog has no health issues, including dental and what not. I want to believe that they will not lie about this kind of stuff. 

I wonder if the statement “it’s not their responsibility“ is normal for a rescue to write on the paper. 
The adoption fee is also non-refundable and I’m not sure if it is normal for a Rescue to do that. 

Some shelters do refund their adoption fee if something goes wrong and if the dog is not a good fit for the family for the first few weeks, or if the dog has a serious illness that they didn’t tell about. For example, in the past, I brought a dog to my home because I was told she was hypoallergenic, but then, she wasn’t. so my mom had an allergy reaction so I had to return her to the shelter next day because my house was little far from the shelter, and the shelter refunded most of my adoption fee. (The dog was adapted to a good family very soon, thankfully)

I am little anxious about what it says on the paper, and since this dog was fostered in the south and transported to my area, the representative cannot guarantee to bring the dog’s toy or the dog’s food because the transporter have a tight limit on what they can carry. 
But she said she can let me know what the dog’s been eating. 

I’m all new to this, so I’m not sure if I need to be cautious about this, or if things are just normal and it’s the usual way that the rescues who transport their animals to North do. 

And since I can’t get any food for the dog, I need to prepare her food on day one. I wonder if I need to buy the same brand of the food and slowly switch to the new food. (A little extra money for me to spend) Or just give her a new food on the first day? (although I don’t think it’s a safe way to do it.)

Please don’t get me wrong. I’m aware that I might need to spend a lot of money to take care of a dog, especially if there’s an accident or if she becomes sick. I’m willing to do it, but I don’t want to adopt a dog based on the misinformation. Then my mind and my family would feel like we’re deceived, and we’re not prepared for it from the day one. I also need some time to get to know this dog as she needs to decompress herself in my house. That’s why I want to make sure everything right before I adopt a valuable life and spend my money and time on that. 

Any experience regarding the rescues who transport the dogs from different states? 
Any advices will help me a lot.

This morning I had to take him out for a potty and he stopped after peeing and would not move, had to carry him home and he barely listens to any commands, he seems tired and depressed also the bandages got wet so I changed them. He still walks inside and follows us but he is super slow and will barely answer to treats (before this he'd do anything for treats)

My vet can't get me in today and they think I've done all I can and they would do the same if I bring him in so they said it's not necessary but my dog is acting super strange.

I looked at his injury and there's some traces of blood on the bandages but not too much and he can move without the bandages and the floor won't get blood on it (so I think it's completely stopped bleeding)

She has to stay for a couple of days and has to have medicated honey put on all the wounds twice a day and has to wear a cone. It's possible someone burned her but the vet said it was not a chemical burn that it was definitely from a fire. The vet said that her burns are 3rd degree burns and that her skin is starting to come off from being burned.  She is keeping her there because she said that she believes her care can be maintained better there than at home. She said she wished that she could bandage it but at this point she can't because of how bad it is. She has had to stop putting the honey on because of how thick it is and has to start using silverdine cream. She said that the way the skin is coming off that the honey would end up making it worse because of how bad it is and the silverdine cream is lighter.

Well this time they walked by this week, he got startled and lunged. I believe he couldn't see them coming, literally.

2. If you hve a dog with nystagmus. How did you train them? Are there actual resources out there - YouTube?

We don’t make a habit of feeding our dog human food, but he gets a couple small bites 2-3 times a week, not counting healthy vegetables while prepping food. 

Usually it’ll be like, if we have steak or crab, we will save him a bite. (we go crabbing locally) 

Every once in awhile if I eat bread I might save him like a 1” piece of crust or less and ‘pretend’ to drop it off the table. 

If I have an egg crack from our chickens I’ll cook it up for him. 

We don’t eat a whole lot of junk food, but of course if a chip drops on the floor he snags it. 

We did strictly no table scraps for a long time because as a puppy he went through a begging phase. Crying under the table while we ate or barking. 

Now he politely sits or lays about 3-5 feet from where we eat and waits quietly to see if anything will be dropped for him, so sometimes I feel like he deserves some good stuff for being good. :)",t2_3frsdvp0,0,How much human food does your dog get regularly?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,103d7ip,True,geenuhahhh,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/103d7ip/how_much_human_food_does_your_dog_get_regularly/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/103d7ip/how_much_human_food_does_your_dog_get_regularly/,2478746,1672862140,0,,False,1672862154,1672862155,2023-01-04 19:55:40,,,,,,

204,dogs,"My dog is an 18.5 year old schnoodle. He is my best friend. I trained him when I was 8 years old. Some health history: 

This year he has become extra sleepy, and takes an extra long time to get settled when napping or going to sleep at night. We don’t know if it’s because he’s in pain, he doesn’t seem to be but we just don’t know. He gets cold laser treatment for his arthritis and takes liver medication. He sometimes eats on his own, but mostly only eats when we hand feed him (after a few bites he gets his appetite back and starts eating on his own. He has always been picky and only has wanted to eat when we eat, and has always been picky about feeding him from a plate rather than a bowl, so it’s hard to tell what is just picky and what is a bad sign). He throws up on an empty stomach quite frequently, although less so now with his new medication. He occasionally has accidents in the house, but not very often. He can’t walk on wood floors so he wears grippy socks. 

On Monday, he had a seizure. He had never had one before. I was holding him when it happened. The emergency vet gave him a lot of seizure medication that basically made him comatose and shake with every breath in. We called and told them this, and they said it’s not normal. Once the drugs eventually wore off, he’s basically back to his old self but a bit sleepier. 

He gets so happy when we’re around, and occasionally still runs and jumps when he’s happy and we’re outside playing. We keep being told “you’ll know when it’s time”, but we really don’t. The emergency vet basically told us (rudely) we should put him down, but our regular vet who has been with him for his whole life says she doesn’t know yet. We want to make sure he has a good quality of life. It’s just so hard to know if he’s in pain when he seems happy with us.

I desperately need advice. 


I got a new shih-poo puppy about 4 weeks ago. My friend's mom impulse purchased him but couldn't care for him, so we got to add to our family. 


It's going really well except...if he is unhappy he makes noises that sound like I'm torturing him. And it's SO LOUD. I had to literally talk to the neighbors about it because I was worried they'd call the cops thinking something terrible was happening to one of my kids. 


It happens mostly when he can't get to someone. For example...he willing runs into his crate when we leave the house. When we get home (after an hour or less) he hears the door slam and he'll start screaming. We also have a gate on our steps (because he enjoys running upstairs to poop in my kids' rooms). If I walk up the steps and he wants to see me....screams. 


I'm a dumbass, and put a video on Animalsbeingderps without context. Immediately got locked and someone said I was 'needlessly torturing an animal for internet points.' 


I've tried the high noise frequency machine to get him to stop. Zero change. Is this a separation anxiety thing? Thoughts/advice?

206,dogs,"(I left his back story in this post— skip to the last paragraph to get to the point)

I adopted my pup, Kodiak, when he was 10 months old from the vet clinic I work at. He was brought to us in terrible shape by the owner of the shop he lived at. Apparently the owner had gone on a vacation and the man that was supposed to be in charge of the shop dog’s care in his absence did not actually care for them. At some point, Kodi was hit by a car. And left for days. And days. Long story short, he was septic by the time he came to us, all four of his feet were hugely swollen, he couldn’t walk, he was barely alive. 

After some extensive hospitalization with us, his bloodwork was finally starting to look up and it became a real possibility that he could go home. The man that hospitalized him decided he did not want shop dogs around people that would not care for them and began looking for home for them. I decided to take Kodi home. 

The swelling on his legs was going down on three legs, which prompted the vet to x-ray the one that was still swollen and we found a broken growth plate. In all, it doesn’t bother him unless he over uses it. We are waiting to see if it will continue to grow incorrectly before amputating as there’s a chance he can keep the leg! The problem is that he’s a pretty high energy dog. We’re having issues with some destructive behaviors because he just doesn’t have enough outlets for all that energy. I have tried the treats hidden in towels but he destroys the towel in the process, which makes me worry about obstruction. Are there any other ideas to keep him stimulated?

207,dogs,"Apologies in advance for the long post, trying to give as much information as possible. 

My boyfriend and I have decided we want another dog. I am not a first time dog owner, have extensive history rescuing &amp; fostering, and purchased a dog of my own a few years ago. That dog was originally bought to be a service dog, where I took him to a multitude of classes but self trained numerous tasks and commands myself. He loves dogs, but is respectful, especially of dogs in our home (i.e the foster we recently had). He gives them space, knows place, and I’m knowledgeable about introductions so never really have any problems. We did have a foster show him aggression a few times (removed her from the situation as it quickly became obvious this was not resource guarding but dog aggression) but he is always calm and never retaliates, so I know he’d do well with a nippy, space invading puppy. He’s young enough he loves to play, so I’d love a dog that is playful. My boyfriend has owned a few dogs, all from puppies so he has puppy raising experience, but isn’t as serious about training or nutrition (my dog gets supplements, raw toppers, etc. he’s fine giving table scraps lol). 

We were originally going to rescue, perhaps keep one of our fosters, but made the decision that buying a puppy would be best for our family. It’s important to me that we buy from a reputable breeder, of which I have great knowledge of as well (if you can’t tell, I’ve worked in the canine industry, but particularly in training and nutrition). 

After a lot of discussions are top three are: 

1. Doberman 
2. Standard or Giant Schnauzer (I admittedly haven’t done as much research on this breed - yet.)
3. English Springer Spaniel 

I love training dogs and want a dog I can do extensive training with, maybe even agility or dog diving or scent training depending on the breed- and am willing to pay for such. I’m not the most active day to day, but make sure my dog goes out plenty of times. My job has a weird split shift, where I do two hours of work in the very early morning and three to four in the afternoon, so I am home most of the day, boyfriend works an evening shift so someone is almost always present. On days were I am not as active my dog is provided mental stimulation and enrichment, as well as the ability to run laps (play fetch, be a dog) and sniff in a large field by our home.(I would like a dog I can eventually trust off leash, but have a sport dog collar my current dog no longer needs to use.) We try to walk five to six miles a week if it’s warm (broken up into one or two mile walks each). Sometimes hikes or excursions to a giant park in our sort (don’t want to reveal location but picture something similar to Central Park). I’m not a huge fan of dog parks but there is one nearby. My boyfriend owns a spacious two bedroom condo, with a living room, dining room, deck, kitchen, and two bathrooms. 

I originally looked at various shepherd breeds (such as an Australian shepherd) but think they might be TOO high energy for me (have many friends with one, so could be biased).

208,dogs,"I'm just looking for any obscure advice or people who have been through something similar. I have two dogs that have access to the yard at all times via a dog door. The neighbor has two huskies that are outside dogs. One of the huskies is a puppy that seems close to fully grown but is well under a year old. These dogs are so bored and so, predictably, they want to come play with our dogs that have toys and mostly use the yard to run around and wrestle.

They've started systematically destroying the fence between the 2 yards. They've gotten through 2 times now and one of those caused an incident where a chunk of fur was yanked out of my one dog's back with slobber all around it. We aren't sure if the dog was intending to bite or if it was trying to play and it got out of hand because it was dark. We heard a commotion, opened the door, and he came running in yelping.

Today, the younger husky jumped over the fence into our yard and was playing with our pup when I noticed. It appears as though when they attempted to patch one of the holes in the fence, they stacked a bunch of rocks against it, which created a convenient ladder for the puppy. He can use one of the blockades that we put up to get back. I could take it down, but then he'd just get stuck in our yard. My dogs have never shown any inclination to try and destroy the fence or get to their side. They're content in our yard afaik. I have video of their dogs trying to rip apart the fence and I managed to record the husky climbing over the fence in both directions. 

I'm not a very confrontational person. My partner chatted with one of the neighbors before the dogs ever broke through and she acknowledged that they need to fix the fence, but it's been snowy here since then so I'm not sure if it's even possible to get someone over to do it for real right now or if they're ""fixing"" it with these awful patches that they're doing. We left a note on their door the first time the dogs got through (neighbors weren't home) and tried to tape one to the fence the 2nd time (although I found it later crumpled up in our yard - not sure if a human or dog did that).

I'm thinking about going out and trying to staple gun some cardboard up where he can look over and hope that discourages him. I guess we could close up the dog door, but that's how our pup is potty trained and, if we're being honest, was one of the big things we looked for when we bought this stupid expensive house a few months ago.

Any other advice to avoid an incident or protect ourselves better should one occur? I don't want to go nuclear with them, but this is starting to get very stressful for me.",t2_2oq9dbvc,0,Neighbor Dogs are constantly breaking into our yard,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,103bvu6,True,MaeliraBear,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/103bvu6/neighbor_dogs_are_constantly_breaking_into_our/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/103bvu6/neighbor_dogs_are_constantly_breaking_into_our/,2478727,1672859084,0,,False,1672859101,1672859101,2023-01-04 19:04:44,,,,,,
209,dogs,"**This is a long post and a long story, so I understand if you don't have the energy to read it or think about it, but it would mean a lot of you do.**

I have 3 dogs, one is a pit bull (Danny) about 5 years old, one is a mix of some kind named Penny, about the same age (possible pit bull, pointer, etc.), and the third one is the daughter of second one, about 1.5 years old (Poppy). 

When Poppy was about 6 or 7 months old, she went through her first heat (I didn't have the funds to spay her in time) and Danny (who is neutered) attempted humping her, etc. which led to their first fight where I had to separate them because they were really trying to hurt each other. A few weeks later, I had gotten a new toy and Poppy was chewing on it and Danny approached her since he was interested in the toy, she growled and then sprung at him because she was possessive over the toy. I had to separate them again because they were hurting each other. I contacted a trainer at that point because I realized that this is a serious issue. Then I bought the same exact toy again so that they could both have it, but Poppy was still showing possessiveness and tried getting Danny's version of it for herself even though hers was right there with her.

In between the time I could get a trainer to come and that last confrontation, Poppy got spayed and the very next day I was about to let them outside (supervised), but I could tell things were tense because the dogs were standoffish and looking/staring at each other. Next thing I know, they're fighting hard. The previous times I was able to separate them with some effort, but this time it takes me several minutes to separate them while I am pretty sure they were trying to kill each other (no exaggeration). I broke my finger sticking my hand by one of their mouths and getting bitten in the crossfire and they both needed to go to the emergency vet. Traumatic for sure.

At the recommendation of the trainer I got in contact with, I tried to find a new home for Poppy (Danny was my original dog, Penny and Poppy were recused years after he was adopted), but due to her aggressiveness that I'm ethically obligated to be transparent about I couldn't find one. And I was not going to surrender her to a shelter where she'd likely be killed, because she is not a purely aggressive dog. With no toys around, they play outside with each other and sleep near each other and will even lick each other's faces. I know she's not a bad dog.

After not being able to find a home for her, we eventually just tried a sort of reintroduction by keeping them separated for a while then slowly reintegrating them with each other. After a few months, I trusted them both enough to let them sleep in the same room again and hang out together. They even play with the ropes we keep around together. However, last month, Poppy had a bone that Danny showed interest in (he simply approached her and didn't attempt taking it), but she growled and quickly attacked once again, so I am back at square one with the trust I have towards them. They still play outside and I've seen them licking each other, but I have them sleep and hang out in separate rooms and keep toys out of sight unless they're by themselves.

Basically, the question I'm seeking perspective on is, do my dogs hate each other? Are dogs capable of caring for each other like a pack while also displaying the behavior I've described above? I know I can always monitor where toys are so that they don't have a reason to fight anymore, but I just worry that my dogs are not compatible and are in danger of hurting each other or killing each other if my monitoring slips up one day.

211,dogs,"Hi all. This is going to be kind of long. I want to preface this by saying I have been to four different vets at three different clinics over the last five months and really none of them have been helpful, so I’m thinking it may be easier to post on here and get many opinions at once and maybe find something similar that’s happened to any of your dogs. 
In August, my 3.5 year old blue heeler started having bad leg pain overnight. I originally thought it was just in his back right leg and he had injured himself without me knowing. He was having a very hard time going from laying to standing and was just generally acting like an old dog with arthritis. I took him to the vet and got him x-rays and gabapentin. The x-rays came back clear except for “maybe some light tissue degeneration in his right knee.” Around the same time, he started having this weird ear crust/goop/ooze thing going on with the tips of his ears. I've googled this to no end but have found absolutely nothing about something stemming from the tips of ears, only inside of ears. It might be irrelevant, but I'd still like to have answers lol. 
Anyway, after he ran out of pain meds I took him to a different vet at the same clinic (I'd been to the vet multiple times in between with no answers), and she said that his ear thing looked like an infection, and that his leg pain could be ehrlichia (he had tested positive in March, but the first vet brushed it off as ""impossible""). She put him on anti inflammatories, more gabapentin, and a 28 day doxycycline treatment for the ehrlichia. At this point it was also obvious that it wasn't just an injury in one leg, but seemed to be a joint issue in all of his legs. None of this helped and a few weeks later I went to a whole new clinic. This lady also told me it seemed like ehrlichia and gave him more antibiotics, also which did not solve the problem. I also noticed around this time a very sensitive spot on his back which the vet described as a ""slipped disc or something"" but didn't have any answers about that, his joint condition, or his crusty ears (which have still not gone away).
The last time I went a few weeks ago, she just gave me more anti inflammatories and gabapentin and told me to give them to him as needed. He kind of needs them every day, but even when he's on them he's still not 'cured'; he still can't run or jump or do anything that he used to be able to do. Other than the leg pain, he's seemed pretty happy through all of this and never stopped eating or drinking or anything. Do I just keep going to bad vets??? They seem to brush me off every time and not have any actual answers for me. Or does my dog actually just have a mystery condition that he'll have to live with for the rest of his life (he's a young dog!!!)?? Is his joint thing related to his back thing? Is any of it related to his ear thing? I don't want him to have to live the rest of his life unable to do the things he loves. I really am just desperate for any answers, explanations, anecdotes, or support. I know that was a lot, but I will clarify anything if needed, and thank you all so much.",t2_6ahy7ycl,0,Dog is sick- vets are no help,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,103bfd5,True,machandcheez,,1,False,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/103bfd5/dog_is_sick_vets_are_no_help/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/103bfd5/dog_is_sick_vets_are_no_help/,2478721,1672858030,0,,False,1672858047,1672858047,2023-01-04 18:47:10,,,,,,
212,dogs,"I have an amazing male Golden Retriever who's 1y7mo old. He's still intact, as we're being extra cautious about waiting for him to finish growing/puberty before fixing him. Strangely for his breed, he's not super food motivated. He's entirely motivated by FUN and struggles with impulse control.

Our dog's biggest vice is pulling on leash, which makes waking him stressful; he wrenches on my husband's arm. We taught him the ""heel"" command, which he can perform indoors or in low-distraction settings. We tried using a Gentle Leader, which is by far the most effective tool, but we've gotten a decent amount of criticism online and even in person for using an ""aversive."" While it doesn't seem to hurt him, we don't want to rely on the tool forever. About a month ago, we went back to a front-clip harness and started planting our feet whenever he pulls and making him sit or heel to keep going—but that happens ever 3 seconds. He doesn't seem to ""get"" it, and we just stop and stop and stop. 

My husband and I had a minor dispute because he feels I leaned too heavily into positive-reinforcement training and failed to use appropriate discipline with a strong-willed dog. (For instance, I tend to scold my husband for yanking on the leash when the dog pulls.) He also feels we can't attribute this to normal puppy behavior, as he's already well into adulthood. (Although I've read that adolescence for large-breed dogs can last for 2+ years.)

He's also not great with recall or keeping paws down when guests come over. Husband has noted repeatedly that while he's very smart and great at doing tricks, his actual obedience skills are poor. I'm not sure how much of this is excusable due to his age (and the fact he's intact?) and how much is our fault. Husband is concerned the dog is ""set in his ways"" at this point, and that we screwed up in puppyhood by letting him rule the house.

Does anyone have advice or input? Should we keep using the Gentle Leader and stop trying to wean him off it? Do we need to give the front-clip/stopping method longer to be effective (no signs it's clicking after a month)? Are there any other good methods to try? Will he age out of this, or will neutering help at all?

219,dogs,"TLDR: how do I find dogs in shelters that look similiar to a specific breed of a dog but arent exactly purebreeds? 


right, long story short- i hate small dogs, and I dont want a big bulky dog like a german shepherd
If I in theory cant knock a dog off me if he jumped onto me and tried biting me, I dont want it. so sighthounds/greyhounds are ideal for me, 
i thought, great! borzois are quite adorable 
the problem is, those dogs (if with a purebred certification and stuff) cost a months average salary here, and its seen as ridiculous to buy a dog here

so now im wondering how to search for a NOT purebred dog, like the dog having mixed genes but still keeping its characteristics such as the snout, (its fucking adorable)
Is my best bet looking at shelter pages?

This is especially true if they’ve been the victims of neglect; which (based on the shape this guy came to me in); I assume that my dog was. He’s still kinda shy &amp; skittish with me; and so I don’t feel as though we’ve reached the level of trust necessary for me to brush his teeth (he gets overwhelmed &amp; upset every time I’ve tried so far). The alternative I’ve been employing is a daily combo of dental treats, dental spray, and a teeth cleaning solution that’s added into his water. I’m wondering though, if that’s good enough; or if there’s something else I should be doing to maximize his dental health?

222,dogs,"My girlfriend adopted a puppy almost exactly one year ago. He was tiny, only a few pounds. We had no idea he would grow so big. 

He is a pit mix. Pushing 100lbs at one year old. The biggest, sweetest goofball with the waggliest tail and the biggest ""pibble"" smile. When he's sweet, I can't get enough of him. I adore him.

But I'm the only one who can walk him. My girlfriend and her son, neither of them are strong enough to deal with his tendency to pull while on walks. He's incredibly intelligent. He learned to sit at all driveways and crosswalks by observing us and our other dog. Never taught him that. He can hear a command and see a gesture and decipher what is being sought. 

But he's stupidly excitable. I cannot get him to calm down on walks. We've tried different harnesses, with attachments on the chest. He doesn't give a shit. We tried a muzzle leader. Again, didn't care. 

He's destroying me physically. I'm 50 years old. Walking him is like walking down a steep hill with a 100lb boulder on a rope, trying to keep it from rolling downhill. My knees are gone; I wear football knee braces just to keep my knees together. I've started using a walking stick for balance. My left hip is like walking with a lit matchstick in my pocket. The lead is pulling so hard on my hands and wrist, I am having increased issues with hand pain. 

By the time we get home from the walk (usually 45 minutes or so), I hate him. 

We've had him in training before. Even when he does well in class, it goes out the window when he gets home. I wonder if it's intentional sometimes. 

He's only a year old. I'm hoping he grows out of this; I have seen a decrease, slowly, in his pulling. A few days are great and I praise him profusely for his gait and pace. But usually it's a workout that is simply beating the shit out of me. I'm too old to take it much more; pretty soon there will be no more walks, and that makes me incredibly sad.  :(",t2_63fr7fd7,0,I love my dog.

We sit in the waiting room for two hours (already missed hours of work at that point). By the time they invite us in both dogs are completely depuffed, normal looking and quite bored. The vet is amused. We are relieved. We pay our massive bill and walk home. We walk through a new park. Big dog slips out of his collar. His recall has been very good lately but the excitement is too much for him. He runs and runs. An amused group of Chinese tourists takes pictures. He gets tired and lies down. We leash him and walk home. On the way back my boyfriend remembers we left the Bolognese in the oven when we ran to the vet. Visions of our house burning down flash before my eyes. We SPEEDWALK.

237,dogs,"I have a 13 year old Great Pyrenees who eats very little. Sometimes he goes on hunger strikes for a couple days, sometimes he only eats one cup of dry food per day. He doesn’t beg for people food, doesn’t seem interested at all. I’ll prepare him a dinner with dog food and beef with broth and he literally turns his nose up at it and will not eat for most of the day. Because of his aversion to food, he’s losing weight and muscle.

I’ve had him for 2 years and he’s always been a little weird about food. I’ll have to encourage him to eat by faking that I’m eating from the bowl and then he sniffs and looks away, and we play this game for 10 mins until he finally takes a bite. 

He’s allergic to birds and eggs, and unfortunately everything that our vet has found contains some form of chicken. 

We’ve been added lean ground beef, roasted beef, cheese, hotdogs- literally anything we think he might be interested in and it works for a meal or two, but then he just turns his nose up at his food. He also refuses multiple brands of canned wet food. He will not eat veggies or apples. 

My questions are:

Do you know of a high calorie powder or possibly broth we could add? 

Do you think a dog this picky would be interested in beef liver/kidneys/ something more on the holistic raw diet?

Is there a high calorie treat out there?

241,dogs,"I’ve been studying in the U.S. for a while, leaving my dog to my mom. But when I came back to visit last summer, I was surprised to see he had black circles around his eyes. It made him look like an ugly raccoon!

My mom already took him to the vet, and they told us it’s “because he’s getting old.” But when I take a look at other dogs that are the same age as my baby (8 years), they don’t have any of that going on at all!

I wanted a second opinion, and have been BUGGING my mom to bring him to the vet, but there’s this distemper disease going around back at home, and we’ve decided to put that on hold since we don’t won’t our dog to be affected.

Yet even when I do the research myself, I’m not getting a lot of answers. Lots of articles are saying it’s probably allergies, or itchy skin problems, but none of it really lines up. He’s been eating the same food for years now, and he seems completely fine about it. And I’ve already found the perfect shampoo for his itchy skin problems, yet nothing is changing with his eyes.

It’s not that weird gunky eye goo either, because I’ve checked, and it’s actually just a loss of fur. I need to know why he’s losing hair around his eyes, and I want to help him as soon as possible! It’s even affecting parts around his nose, so I wonder if there’s any correlation. His skin is black around those areas as well, and I’d show y’all a picture if it wasn’t for the community guidelines.

We have her sleep in her crate overnight since we brought her home. We are too the point the last couple months that she will hold her bladder through the night.

I get up most of the week, because of my work schedule and I’m feeling a bit exhausted. Is there any recommendations to help her sleep through the night? Even to 5 am? 

To add, we also don’t want to use the crate forever and have been trying to discuss leaving her out at night or for short periods while we are gone in the day.

243,dogs,"My fiance and I adopted a dog on the 23rd of December and fell in love with him. He's the sweetest, most perfect dog for our household and we've been ecstatic to have him here, especially to enjoy the holidays with. Because the vet we wanted to use was still off for the holidays, we brought him into a PetSmart vet on the 26th for a wellness check and because he was doing this ""reverse-sneezing"" type thing that we were unsure of. The vet prescribed something to help with coughs and he was fine - no more issues.

On the 31st, our boy came down with a terrible fever (106.5F), nasal discharge, lethargy, and labored breathing. He could barely walk and his bathroom visits were strange - he would pee once, all the way, then try again to pee one or two more times to no avail. His poops were soft and mucousy, which was unusual.

We immediately brought him to the preferred vet who couldn't diagnose him with anything in particular but through stool and blood testing found it was likely something viral and that it'd just have to run its course. He gave our dog some subcutaneous fluids and antibiotics and told us to closely monitor his temperature.

We took him home and almost immediately his fever lowered to some reasonable levels, and was mostly stable around 103.5F. He would drink water from a bowl, and ate some pumpkin but wouldn't eat his normal kibble or treats.

The next morning his fever was back up to almost 105F so we brought him into an emergency clinic (it was new Year's day) for hospitalization. He spent the day and night there, and came back to us with about 103F temp and a day's worth of IV fluids and antibiotics, which helped him a ton. We brought him back home and he's started to gain his personality back, he's walking fine, and starting to breathe better but it's been three more days of low to mid grade fever and he won't eat anything since the hospitalization.

At this point he's got an antibiotic course (Clavacillin), some nausea meds (Cerenia), some probiotic supplements, and metoclopramide. We've been giving him his take home meds with peanut butter by more or less smearing it on his gums and he'll eat the peanut butter when it's in his mouth but won't take anything off a plate or hands. We've tried his regular kibble, new wet food from the vet, new wet food from the urgent care, boiled chicken and rice with chicken broth, baby food, and syringe feeding him a watery mixture of nutritional wet.

He'll only eat it if it's in his mouth or if some spilled in a place he's resting in/on his body. We tried putting peanut butter on his paws but he caught on quick and stopped licking it off after about a spoonful.

He'll take water (or Pedialyte) with a syringe usually just fine, about 25ML per session. He's still very lethargic and has some troubled breathing but the humidifier is helping him tons with that.

I'm worried about his nutrition and if while we're so focused on the fever he might starve to death in front of me. He's 24 lbs and getting maybe 150-200 calories per day and about 125ML of water. He won't tolerate tons of syringe feeding and seems to hate me for making him eat/drink. I'm so worried he'll die from this, and it's just so terrible to have had him for such a short time before thinking that he'll pass away.

245,dogs,"I got an allergen panel for my poor lab, he's severely allergic to beef, venison, lamb, chicken, kangaroo, fish, bison, pork, virtually every type of grass, all dairy, wheat, and most grains. He's only moderately allergic to turkey. 

Just about every specialty dry dog food we give him still has fillers that break him out, and we've got him on some extremely expensive anti-allergen medications (Apoquel). Our vet said she's never seen an organism so allergic to so many things, The only thing that doesn't break him out is hills prescription diet for skin sensitivity, and even then we have to freeze it because the common mites that infest dog food in shipping break him out.

We've begun grinding up duck and turkey to feed him, but even that seems to break our poor doggy out. Between the Hill's and apoquel, about 50% of our disposable income goes to trying and failing to feed our doggy something that won't make him a suffering pile of inflammation. On top of that, for years we thought it was an environmental allergy before realizing it was that AND food allergies.

247,dogs,"Tldr; dog is escape artist and barker, needs more attention, it is ruining our lives and our baby's sleep, he is obviously unhappy but probably can't be rehomed.

We adopted our Weimaraner mix over two years ago, he is around 4-5yo now. We wanted a different dog but the rescue owner begged us to take him because he had a really really sad background story and she didn't have any space for him, he had just gotten there a few days prior.

He is so loving and sweet but we just can't take care of him anymore. We got him while living in an apartment, we felt bad so we used all of our savings to rent a house with a huge yard. Then we moved states and ended up with a much smaller fenced yard and a newborn so his need for exercise wasn't being met and he was lonely now that all of our attention went to our newborn.

A couple months later we adopted another dog that he had bonded with during a trip to visit family (they both escaped their respective yards to play together, and the owner was an old woman who inherited the dog). They get along so well and just keep each other company so well, with matching energy levels. But they started escaping our small fenced yard together in the summer. We got death threats from a neighbour (to our dog, not to us) where police was involved, warnings from animal control about public disturbance, fines, etc.

So we took out a $10,000 loan to have a privacy fence built around our entire yard (much bigger than what was previously fenced). And we put in a doggie door so they would always have access to the exterior during the day (2nd dog had issues holding in his poop, the doggie door has resolved the issue and we are pee/poop free inside ever since). But we are seriously indebted from all of this and struggling to recover.

They spend a lot of time outside running, playing, exploring the tall grass, barking and running after squirrels, etc. Their behaviour improved a lot and they seemed happy for half a year.

And then two days ago he climbed the 6ft privacy fence and ran away. My husband ran after him for a mile before he caught up to him and brought him home. He put some obstacles in front of the pathway that leads to the bigger fenced area where he climbed the fence.

It didn't stop him. Yesterday I was alone with our baby and I let the dogs out thinking they couldn't get away and I was wrong. He climbed the privacy fence again and ran away. I called animal control and my neighbor to warn them and I was crying. So hard trying to explain the situation. We have a high needs child, and I'm almost 6 months pregnant. I ran out with my baby in my arms and my neighbor helped me catch him and bring him home. Animal control arrived shortly after and was telling me about all these expensive GPS devices to track him if he runs away again.

This morning we put up a 7-8ft board at the pathway so he truly can't go to the spot where he climbs and runs. And my husband just caught him trying to run and jump over it. We're at the end of our rope.

He also is very reactive, he barks all day and night long at the smallest noise outside, any car that drives by, any person walking past our house, any squirrel he can see through a window. He will bark for hours at night because hm the house creaks. Our baby isn't getting sleep during the day or night, we aren't getting sleep. It is driving us crazy. We have contacted trainers and been told they probably can't do anything to help us.

He is really friendly to people and most other dogs but is very mouthy and reactive. He will growl and bark non stop at anything that moves, and other dogs and people take it as a sign of aggression. Walks are just not possible anymore because he pulls so hard and we have a baby (my husband works 24hr shifts so it's just mostly me with the baby and two dogs).

We need to rehome him. We are miserable, he clearly needs a family that will spend time walking him and getting all his energy out. How can we rehome a dog that won't stop escaping and barking? He is otherwise so sweet but this has cost us so much financially and mentally.

I reached out to the shelter/rescue that gave him to us and they don't want him back because he runs away.",t2_sqobhqwt,0,[Help/Advice Needed] Rehoming escape artist,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,1035up1,True,ugly-quilt,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1035up1/helpadvice_needed_rehoming_escape_artist/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1035up1/helpadvice_needed_rehoming_escape_artist/,2478640,1672844868,0,,False,1672844883,1672844884,2023-01-04 15:07:48,,,,,,

We are doing a research. How about the idea of a smart dog collar? You can get EKG and heart rate data and you can contact the veterinarian with the instant ask vet button.

So this doesn't give you a chance to ask at home beforehand instead of going to the vet? Or we may have understood the feelings thanks to the smart collar. The research I've read says we don't actually understand dogs very well. Perhaps the thing that will reduce the stress of our dogs is to know what music they like!

Comet was initially my partner's dog and Cornbred was mine; we've been living together for around a year, and they rock! They get along, play a lot, and are very well behaved. A few months ago, my partner found Howl in a very dangerous and life threatening situation (he was being attacked by other dogs) when he was about 4 months old. There was no mama in the picture, and he took Howl home. We hadn't planned on getting another dog at this point, but when helping him recover we fell head over heels for Howl. He's got some problems from his old situation (he has a severe lazy eye and one of his ears is paralyzed), but overall he's done really well! He's sweet, loving, and absolute golden hearted. But, there have been some struggles, and advice for them would be super helpful:

1. He is extremely skittish. Noise outside? He's terrified. I shift in my seat? He's on high alert. He's better than he was before, but he is still constantly on edge, ready to run and hide. While I understand why, I know it can't be good for him. What are some tips for helping him feel calm? We've tried kennel training, toys, being with us, spending time with his brothers, and training to build confidence, but it's still really hair triggered. I understand he might always be skittish, but is there anything else I can do to help? I can't even try to walk him around the neighbor hood because when we leave our yard, he freezes and shakes uncontrollably. He also fear pees if someone comes to the house. 

2. He doesn't understand solo play, and it can be overwhelming for the other dogs. He's so excited to have his brothers that he (after getting over his initial fear) struggles with boundaries. Comet's napping? Time to jump on his head! Cornbread's trying to eat? Nip at his ankles! When they try to leave the situation or signal him to stop, he often keeps pressing. When that happens, if he won't turn his attention to a toy or me, I've started putting him in the kennel to get him to settle before interacting with them again. Is that a good method or am I making it worse?

3. He is destructive, specifically to socks and blankets. If he is left alone for even a moment, he'll tear a hole in a blanket. I mostly broke him of that habit, but when my partner's dad had to dog sit for us for a week, he let Howl pick the habit back up, and now it's worse than ever! What can be done to stop this behavior? I'm worried about him swallowing strings and needing a vet visit.

4. This goes back to point 1, but he never wants to sleep or even remain still. We have our dogs sleep in the bed with us, but Howl just can't sleep through the night. Hell, he struggles to sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time. It worries me because it doesn't seem like he's getting enough rest, but he's always so on edge that he is a single creak away from waking right back up; when that happens, he hops straight into tearing things up or trying to play. In the kennel, he refuses to sleep, though, and instead screams the entire night because he doesn't want to be alone. What advice, if any, do you have for managing sleep?


While all of our dogs were rescues, Cornbread and Comet were more level natured. Cornbread was young from a shelter and had been in a foster home, so he was quite well behaved from the get go, excluding normal puppy chaos. Comet was more chaotic, but he settled quite well with training. We love Howl to bits, and we do see strides in his behavior. I just worry about him; any tips, advice, or even encouragement/tales of similar struggles with a rescue would be really appreciated.",t2_ltnd34ot,0,Advice for a Struggling Rescue Puppy,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,1034ki2,True,NoteAdele,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1034ki2/advice_for_a_struggling_rescue_puppy/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1034ki2/advice_for_a_struggling_rescue_puppy/,2478620,1672841403,0,,False,1672841415,1672841416,2023-01-04 14:10:03,,,,,,

258,dogs,"We got together with a small group of people last night. It was at a neighbor’s house that we know well. Our dog came with us. She is super friendly with the neighbors and visits often, so she is comfortable in their home.

Another person joined us whom we know pretty well, but whom our dog had never met before. She immediately made it clear that she didn’t like him. He made a point of trying to interact quietly and positively with her, gave her treats, etc. - but still she didn’t want to be anywhere near him and growled if he tried to touch her.  We saw some lip-licking and tail between the legs body language. This was really out of character for her.

She is a middle-aged, mellow dog. She has only ever been growly with people a couple of times before - once with a contractor who was making a bid, and once with someone repairing an appliance. But, there have been far more friendly interactions. We didn’t go with that contractor, and she was immediately friendly with the next guy who came to make a bid, even though he was bigger and louder. She is usually friendly with people on trails, happy to interact with everyone at the vet’s office, etc.

264,dogs,"My best friend has a smaller dog (pom-chihuahua mix). He's incredibly nervous around people that aren't her, and her sisters. He also dislikes men (has been living in the same household with my best friend's dad for a few years now and still will not go to him/barks at him any time he walks by).

He has a tendency to bolt out the door or try to. He was a stray before he got adopted and has been lost by a sitter before. 

I've dogsat him once at my house and I was extremely worried about the outcome but despite not being much a of human fan, he loves other dogs. I think if it weren't for my other dog being there, it wouldn't have gone as well. 

The first night, he stayed under my couch all day. I didn't force him to come out but when I jingled a leash, he reluctantly came out. I think seeing my dog get excited for a walk, he knew what was up. We got back from the walk and he hid under the couch again. 

Over the course of a few days, he went from sitting under the couch all day to jumping onto my bed and sleeping with me and my dog. I was happy thinking we had gotten past some mistrust but as soon as he went home, it was like I was a stranger again. He barks and runs away from me the same way he did when we first met. It's like that every time I go over her house. 

This time I'm dogsitting again except I'm doing it in her house. I brought my dog to stay with us in hopes that it makes him feel a bit less anxious. When he was staying with us, it was me, my dad, mom, and dog. Right not it's just me and my dog alone with him in the house.

This was their response (at first I thought WSAVA approved dog brands, but I know it doesn't work liek that):

 

Thanks  for your inquiry. I can certainly understand the confusion all the  information out there can cause. I hope to provide you with some  valuable information to help clarify things for you.

To  begin, there are no actual 'WSAVA Approved' foods. WSAVA (World Small  Animal Veterinary Association) formulated a set of questions which  consumers and veterinarians can ask pet food companies to assess their  suitability for the pets they feed. There is no approval process. 

With  the above being said, I can tell you that Petcurean has been making high  quality dog and cat food for over 20 years. The health and wellbeing of  your pets and ours are at the heart of everything we do. Petcurean  recipes are formulated by our team of passionate and qualified  nutritionists. Our Nutrition Manager has a MSc in Companion Animal  Nutrition and a Bachelor of Science in Biological Science from the  University of Guelph. Also on the team is one nutritionist with a  Bachelor of Science in Companion Animal Health and a Master of Science  in Animal Science from the University of Alberta. Thus, each  nutritionist has at least 6 years of post-secondary education  specializing in nutrition.

Petcurean  conducts a wide variety of tests on incoming ingredients and final  products. In addition to our own rigorous testing, we meet or exceed  governmental standards for pet food in Canada, the United States and  more than 35 other countries where our food is sold, including many  European Union countries that have some of the strictest regulations in  the world. We test our ingredients and finished products for quality and  nutritional integrity using third-party labs, and no product is shipped  until favourable results are received. 

​

If  you wish, I can certainly provide you with our responses to the WSAVA  questions so that you can gauge for yourself how well qualified we are.  Please let me know if this is of interest to you. Thank you for reaching  out.

Warm regards,

Val

268,dogs,"So I have a 11 year old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, cancer survivor and an old grumpy man. He is not aggressive, he has a few dogs he adores and would sell me for them. But whenever a new, specifically young dog appears he isnt too happy. Today on a walk, a young dog ran towards him and started jumping on him and me. The owner had a problem with catching him. He was okay for a few minutes, but eventually he started growling at the dog, giving him very clear warning signals, the dog didn’t stop. The growling intensified whenever the pup touched him. So I held him and his mouth so he does not bite, he never did before but you never know. Eventually the owner caught the pup and they did give themselves a nice nose touch with wagging tails, once he was under control.

270,dogs,"before going to bed tonight, my dog got a hold of a cough drop. They were the “Halls Mentho-Lyptus” flavour cough drop. i caught him in the act so he only got a hold of one and didn’t even eat the whole thing. I think he ate half of one.

Here’s the thing I’m worried about. He’s a smaller dog (around 9 pounds). 

It’s currently 1am where I live and no emergency vets are open (I live in a small town). Usually I’d right away call the clinic or emergency vet. 

Research told me that halls are safer as they don’t contain Xylitol. Just a bit worried about Menthol and Eucalyptus though. But other searches has said that it isn’t too worrying aside from GI upset. 

Still…I’ve been worried. but so far though, he’s been normal and hyper. Now sleeping as it’s 2am. All I’ve done was tried to give him ice cubes and water to hopefully help dilute it.

272,dogs,I have a Multi Pooh that is going on 2 years old now. The other day I noticed that he hadn’t been acting his normal fun self. Me and my wife examined him and noticed this really deep 2 inch wound on his armpit created from the dog harness. At this point I was freaking out I’d never seen such a deep laceration on a dog in my entire life. We took him to the emergency room immediately after we noticed. The Vet shaved the area around the wound and told us she gave him a shot to avoid infection. She also stated that she would provide us with an ointment. I was under the impression that it would need to have stitched since it’s pretty much a wide open wound that was cut so deep that two the arm is cut to two separate parts of skin she said since the cut seems to be older then a day she wouldn’t be able to stitch it at the moment and advised me and my wife to just keep an eye on it and make sure to clean him with the ointment twice a day and if notice it’s getting infected to come back. Then she can entire perform surgery or advise us the next step. I don’t know what to do and I’m panicking at this point. His arm today is more dry then yesterday but I don’t know how it’s gonna just magically attach together since the cut is literally so deep. Can someone please help anything would be appreciated I can’t keep watching him look like this .also any advice on how to clean him. Every time I try to put the ointment he tries to bite me.

Sex/Neuter status: neutered

Breed: Basset Hound

Body weight: ~45 lbs

History: mild, previously resolved vomiting issue involving eating hair

Clinical signs: has been throwing up his food anywhere from 0.5-3.5 hours after eating

Duration: 1 day (so far)

Your general location: Central Texas

My dog has been throwing up his all his food today, generally, it's been mushy, liquid-ish with chunks and generally looks half digested and with a smell halfway between the normal smell of vomit and his poop. We (foolishly) made the mistake of feeding him again shortly after he vomited breakfast and dinner, and while he did keep his breakfast down the second time, dinner he again threw up about 2 hours later, and after giving him more food, he threw that up around 2 hours later as well. Several hours after that, he was given a very small handful of food to try to ease him into it, and it was likewise thrown up a couple hours later

Edit: forgot to add, other than throwing up, his behavior has been 100% normal.

274,dogs,"Hello everyone, please bare with my english as it is not my first language but I just wanted to get some of my frustrations out..

We have a lovely mix bernard and siberian 16-yo with bouts of diseases: 

- managed enlarged heart (diagnosed just last year)
- enlarged prostate(dog is intact), they told us it might be malignant but we have been successfully managed it for 2 yrs since diagnosis)
- CKD (diagnosed 2 yrs and have been carefully managing it since)

since the diagnosis of our dog’s diseases, we have been religiously getting him regular work ups(almost monthly) to monitor his condition and everything is well managed, he is as happy and lively as a normal senior dog up until 2 weeks ago..

One night, while i was cleaning his teeth, one of his molars cracked and the next day, he started to drool on the side of his face where his tooth cracked. we decided to get him to the hospital as he doesn’t want to eat anymore. His usual vet wasn’t around so a different vet attended to his needs. They got his bloodwork and everything came back normal (apart from his creatinine which was just a couple of units above the borederline) so they gave him painkillers and antibiotics for 2 weeks as the vet said an infection is already starting as per the blood test. We got home, gave him all his maintenance meds, his additional meds and after 2 days drooling stops and everything was okay again. 

After 5 days of giving his medication, he started to vomit. He hasn’t vomited in year so it got me alarmed and thought maybe it was the additional medications given. We went back to the vet as he didn’t stop vomiting every time i try to feed him and give his maintenance. They did a physical exam and xrays which showed that he had gas buildup in his stomach so they gave medications for it. They said that i could stop giving him his painkillers too. A day after that visit, even though I gave the anti-flatulence meds, he still continued to vomit. We then decided to get him back and this time they did take a blood exam and saw that his kidney values are high. By this time, I highly suspected its because of the additional medication since we have not had any changes with his routine apart from that. As suggested by the vet, we decided to have him confined during a course of 3 days to see if it will improve. I wasn’t worried since we have had a similar situation before where we learned that he cannot tolerate eating even regular boiled chicken so we never gave him any since and his kidneys were okay since.

During his confinement,  they asked us to send his maintenance meds and his usual canned food so that the vet bills will be lessened. They gave us daily updates on his condition so I was feeling good about it since he was gaining his appetite back and he looked a lot better.

On the 2nd day of his confinement, I noticed in the images they sent that they changed his diet to purely boiled chicken without informing us. I messaged them on that but they did not get back to me and so on the 3rd day when he was about to be discharged, they did bloodtest and his kidney values rose to 300%. I was so mad with what happened and confronted them on this. They didn’t even compensated us from what happened and just kept on apologizing. We just decided to take him back home.

Now it has been 3 days since we got him discharged and he isnt showing signs of getting better. He hasn’t been eating but he does drink alot of water and pees alot but he lost so much weight and its killing me seeing him in this state. My family and I have been considering PTS if after 2 days his blood results doesn’t improve.. 

I still feel angry and frustrated from what happened but we can’t do anything about it now.. I love our dog so much. He saved me during a dark time in my life. Taking care of him gave me joy and meaning so seeing him in his current state had me so broken. If I could give him one of my kidneys I would just to make him better.

276,dogs,"My dog of 14 years recently passed and I’m looking to adopt a new puppy. He was a small dog, a coton de tulear, but I also had a golden retriever before him when I was growing up. 

I’ve done some digging online and I understand these can be difficult dogs to own. I would only buy from a registered breeder and I intend on getting the pup professionally trained as soon as possible. I’m a single male in my 30’s and live alone in a house with a big backyard that connects to a ravine, I’m confident I have the space for him. I have 2 small children in my immediate family (under 3 years old) who are going to be all over whatever dog I bring into the family. 

I’m obsessed with this breed, I find them so beautiful and loyal and I like the guard dog capability being that I live alone backing onto a public ravine (fenced backyard). I still want a friendly dog though, good with kids, can go to a dog park and don’t have to worry about fights. I’d also like to bring him to work with me - I run my own business and my office is up the street. I was thinking I’d be able to handle owning one but all the content I’m seeing online is making me question if it’s actually the right breed for me.

When I was a young girl, we had a dog named Snickers. My dad got it for free from some rando (undoubtedly a backyard breeder) and gave it to us kids to “take care of”.

Well, as the years went by, Snickers was neglected of attention and was mostly just fed every day. He was an outside dog and had a huge yard to run around in as well as another dog to play with. So he wasn’t an unhappy dog. 

My dad decided to get rid of him when he lost patience for his jumping/hyper problem. He would constantly jump on us kids and, instead of training him, my dad did the unforgivable. He refused to give him to a shelter because “If I did, they wouldn’t let us adopt anymore”.

So he took Snickers into the back of his truck (terrifying him - he’d never been in a car before) and drove him to a random field to drop him off forever. He was abandoned and lost his family forever, probably watching the car roll away, wondering what he did wrong. 

I can’t believe my dad could do such a horrible thing. I don’t know how he sleeps so peacefully at night. I’m sure he prayed for forgiveness and never thought about it again.

I’m gonna be honest. I reread this today and cried. Reading this over, I can tell now how dark of a mindset I was in. Grief is a monster we all have to battle in our own time, and I was losing mine. 

But I got back up with the help of an ad I saw on Craigslist. A foster-based rescue in my area was looking for volunteers. I dove headfirst in and ended up with a wonderful foster puppy , who changed my life. She stole my heart, and I put all my time into her and her brother. I gained a new appreciation for the love a dog can give, something I never really understood before. Because of her, my mom and I had an honest, heart-to-heart talk for the first time in years about how we both felt about our dogs. She confessed to feeling similarly to me, struggling with resentment towards our dogs and their behavior. We sat the family down and agreed to hire a professional trainer, who’s done *wonders* for our family. I’m so much happier and feel closer to my pets than ever. 

Now, I write this, I’m crying again- but this time, happy tears. We’re still learning as a family, but we’re growing together. 

Oh, and remember how I said I never really felt bonded to any of our dogs? Turns out I just needed the right dog.

For almost a year now, I have been struggling to find a food that my dog will eat. I have tried multiple different kibbles and several fresh foods. My dog loved the fresh foods, but has never found a kibble he'd tolerate for more than a day or two. Fresh food is somewhat outside my budget, but I'm desperate for him to eat consistently and occasionally consider breaking the bank on the fresh food. Every time I consider it, however, I come back to Reddit and see the almost unanimous consensus towards the Big Five WSAVA compliant companies. 

I've read through this sub's wiki and linked resources about it and am somewhat convinced, but upon further inspection, Royal Canin, Eukanuba, Iams, and Hill’s all seem to be chicken or turkey based formulations which my dog is allergic to. Purina has only a few non-chicken formulations as far as I can tell, and we have already tried Purina Pro Sensitive Skin and Stomach, and he just won't eat it. It seems crazy to me that following the general consensus on DCM and WSAVA guidelines leaves me with only one or two food options (which my dog does not like). Am I missing something? I know there are plenty of people who feed outside of these five companies, but I'd like to hear from those who support WSAVA guidelines on what they think I should do.

So it will most likely fall to me to walk after work. I'm also concerned about if my partner passes away giving a dog enough attention (especially a golden)

303,dogs,"Hi all.

I recently lost my border collie/lab mix Shiloh to Hemangiosarcoma. She was just shy of her 12th birthday. When she was diagnosed I was devastated and tried to look anywhere I could for information on what to do next. Several posts on here helped me get through the tougher days, especially when I didn’t know what to do next. I hope by sharing Shiloh’s story, someone going through a tough time might find some comfort as well. I don’t intend anything here to be advice, just my experience.

Shiloh, for the most part, had been a healthy dog with no serious health problems. She had been to the vet in early June 2022, and even with additional screening including blood tests and a urine sample, there were no problems to report. The vet had noticed some early signs of arthritis in her back legs, but it didn’t limit her mobility and we had her on supplements (Dasuquin and Movoflex) to help as well.

On Saturday July 23, my wife noted that Shiloh was walking a little awkwardly. I took her for a short walk to see if it would pass. On the walk itself she seemed fine, but when we returned she laid down as if she had just run a marathon on a hot day – her tongue was hanging out and she was breathing fast shallow breaths. I tried to pick her up and put her on her favorite couch, and she yelped in pain very loudly and I noticed her stomach was very tight. We called her vet, who couldn’t see her for a few days and took a more ‘wait and see’ attitude. We however suspected something severe so we rushed her to the emergency vet. After a couple of hours, the ER vet reported that they had found blood in her abdomen. In order to stop the bleeding, they would essentially need to do exploratory surgery and hope they could find the source and fix/remove it. The likely suspect was the spleen, but they wouldn’t know until they cut her open.

As for the prognosis, this was the first time cancer was mentioned. The vet informed us that there was a 70% chance that it was cancer, or 30% chance something else. We were told if it was not cancer, the prognosis is good that if the surgery went well she would recover and live the rest of her natural life. If it was cancer, it was likely Hemangiosarcoma and she would likely have less than a year to live. The surgery would range in cost from $9k - $12k. And we were left to make a decision on what to do next. 

My wife and I discussed what to do and ultimately decided to do the surgery. Our main thinking was even though 30% chance wasn’t exactly winning odds, it’s definitely not 0%. Also, as I mentioned, Shiloh didn’t really have any other health challenges, so we were hopeful that if it was not cancer, she could still enjoy a very high quality of life. We were also very fortunate to have pet insurance that would ultimately cover 90% of the surgery costs (Pet’s Best $1k deductible infinite coverage plan).  More emotionally, we were not ready to say goodbye to our girl and just wanted to hope for the best. We told the vet that we wanted to the surgery, but if at any time they discovered that it was very likely cancer (i.e. obvious tumors everywhere), we would consider euthanasia.

The surgery took 2-3 hours and went well. The surgeon did not report any obvious tumor spread. Shiloh’s lungs and her heart looked clear. The spleen was indeed the culprit causing the bleeding and they removed it successfully. They also noted there were some nodules on the liver, and removed a couple of those to send with the spleen for biopsy. Shiloh had to be kept at the hospital for observation. The next day we were told she was generally doing well, but overnight had suffered an arrhythmia which was typical for her age and this type of surgery. The arrhythmias usually resolve themselves, but she required medical intervention (a dose of Sotalol). The vet thought it best she stay an additional night to monitor the arrhythmias. 

On Monday, we were able to bring her home. She was so excited to see us that she ran to the car and hopped in no problem, and it wasn’t until we got home we could see that she was absolutely exhausted. We took her to our back door since it didn’t require stairs, and barely got her inside before she laid down. We very gradually had her move from the back door to the living room onto her bed. We brought our mattress from upstairs to the living rooms, and spent the next 2 days or so on the floor with her as she recovered from surgery. The only medication she was on at this time was Sotalol, which was given twice a day to help with the arrhythmias. We also made an appointment with a cardiologist – the soonest available appointment being September 13th. 

We actually were surprised how quickly she bounced back from surgery. Within a couple of days she was pretty much herself if not limited by the incision/staples. I think within 4 days she was jumping onto couches again (even though we tried to discourage it so she wouldn’t rip her staples). Everyday seemed to be an improvement in appetite and energy level.

On Thursday July 28, we received the results of the biopsy. While the liver tests did not report any Hemangiosarcoma, her spleen had multiple tumors. We made the soonest appointment available with an oncologist which was for August 17th. At this point we started researching the treatment options available. We started Shiloh on I’m Yunity (7 pills a day) and Yunnan Baiyao (6 pills a day) as soon as we could. We also research chemotherapy. We heard a wide variety of thoughts and opinions on this. Some people were completely against it, saying they would never put a dog through chemotherapy. Others sources said dogs generally don’t have any side effects since the dose is so low. So by the time we got to the oncologist appointment we approached it with an open mind. The oncologist said that about 80% of dogs do not have side effect while the rest do, and generally the side effects are minimal. On that, we decided to attempt chemotherapy, but we would only continue if Shiloh handled it well.

And unfortunately, she did not handle the first dose that well.  We started giving Shiloh anti-nausea the day of the chemo as per the oncologist’s recommendation. The first couple of days were fine and that is pretty typical. By Friday night we could tell her appetite was lessening. By Saturday she was barely eating. On Sunday, she wasn’t eating at all, even cooked chicken which is her favorite. We took her to the emergency vet and they gave us different anti-nausea medication and an appetite stimulant. By Tuesday she was mostly back to normal.

We returned to the oncologist 3 weeks later. We knew we would not continue chemo at that dose again, and wanted to see what the other options were. The oncologist said basically the first dose was at the high end for her weight, and they would try it at the low end. In her experience, of the dogs that had symptoms with chemo, 80% would not have symptoms with the lower dose. We took her word for it noting that it Shiloh struggled again we would not continue. Luckily, she handled the lower dose much better. We still saw some food hesitation on the same schedule (3-5 days after chemo), but she never stopped eating or drinking and her energy level seemed fine. The only other symptom she had was a loose stool, and that would come and go but never seemed that problematic. We were able to do 5 chemo treatments in total, with her last treatment being November 9. 

In between chemo visits, we did also have the cardiologist visit to examine Shiloh for heart arrhythmias He did a full echocardiogram and noted that her heart was in good shape and that 1 – we could stop giving her Sotalol, 2 – he did not see any evidence of tumors on the heart and 3 – she was heathy enough to continue chemo treatments. 

I realize looking back at what I’ve written, it kind of seems like all the treatments and managing of symptoms was chaotic. But really, it didn’t feel like it at the time. The 3 week spacing of the chemo allowed us to get into a pretty normal rhythm. And aside from the relatively minor side effects of chemo, Shiloh was in great spirits. The only silver lining I found with Hemangiosarcoma is that it doesn’t have symptoms – until it does. Shiloh was completely herself during this time. She was able to do everything she normally did – long walks, playing in the dog park, and eating the ridiculous amount of food we spoiled her with. If you did not know about her diagnosis during this time, you would not know she was sick. We took her to the beach for a week, took on trips to see my family, and enjoyed the extra time we felt we had been given.

After the last chemo treatment, we were given an option to bring her in 3 weeks later for x-rays and ultrasound to see how the cancer had progressed, if at all. We decided against it. We felt that since there was no longer anything they could do, knowing how far it had progressed wouldn’t really serve any purpose. Our decision was we would base any future decision completely on how Shiloh was feeling.

Everything we were hoping to prevent started happening on Thursday December 15. Shiloh seemed a little lethargic but for a generally lazy dog it was hard to differentiate. We had to drive an hour away to visit family that evening, and brought her with us. By chance, I brought the Yunnan Baiyao emergency pills with me. When we got out of the car, we could tell she was having a bleed. She was panting heavily, her gums were pale, and her stomach muscles were tight. I gave her an emergency pill, and we quickly explained what was happening to our family and took Shiloh to the nearest emergency vet.

Our unsaid plan had always been when she has a bleed, we will give her an emergency pill, take her to the vet, and have her put down. The thing I don’t we were prepared for was the emergency pills work. We got to the vet and were seen immediately – about 20 minutes after I gave her the pill. She was still not doing well. They have her an ultrasound and while they did note she had some blood in her abdomen, it wasn’t a lot. They then gave us a room for what we thought were our last goodbyes. Within the hour, she completely turned around. She stopped panting. The color returned to her gums. She started being more alert. When the vet came by, she did a check and all her vitals seemed normal. After talking with the emergency vet, we decided to bring her home and monitor her to see how she did.

The next morning, she seemed to have a similar attack, but at least in my recollection, it was less severe. We were still in bed so we weren’t moving around a lot. I gave her another emergency pill, and in a couple of hours she seemed fine again. The rest of the day we spent spoiling her including a trip to McDonald’s for some cheeseburgers and fries. We invited her favorite “aunt” over and Shiloh was just as excited to see her as she ever was.

The next morning she seemed fine. We invited my in-laws over and Shiloh was again very excited to see some of her favorite people. Around 3 pm, we saw the symptoms starting again and saw the color leave her gums. This time we knew it was time. We took her to the emergency vet. We said our final goodbyes and Shiloh very peacefully crossed the rainbow bridge. Shiloh lived until December 17th, just under 5 months from her first sign of symptoms.

Looking back over the entire experience, I don’t think I feel any regret. We vowed not to let Shiloh suffer and at least as far as we could tell she didn’t. When we felt she was suffering and it wasn’t going to get better, we said goodbye. I felt there was some judgement, especially with our choice to do chemo – but ultimately I don’t regret it as I think that probably extended her life the most and she had very good quality of life until the end. We gave her I’m Yunity and Yunnan Baiyao religiously – never missing a dose over the last 5 months, but I don’t think I can say definitively whether they helped or not (aside from the Yunnan Baiyao emergency pills which seemed to work wonders in her final days). I was also super thankful that we had pet insurance. For the first 6 years we had the insurance it didn’t cover a single dollar of expenses. In the last 5 months of her life it covered probably about $14k or so in claims, and I never had to argue over a single charge.

If you’re reading this because you are going through a similar experience, I hope something here is of use to you. Shiloh was my soul dog and I am still crushed by her loss, but I do feel like I’m beginning to mend. I hope you cherish the time you still have with your dog, and if it’s too late I hope you find peace.",t2_gmc8l,0,Shiloh's Battle with Hemangiosarcoma,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,102sdk9,True,techemeche,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102sdk9/shilohs_battle_with_hemangiosarcoma/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102sdk9/shilohs_battle_with_hemangiosarcoma/,2478460,1672802187,0,,False,1672802205,1672802205,2023-01-04 03:16:27,,,,,,

About a year ago he came up to a spot on my outter thigh near the glutes and he pressed his nose into my thigh and sniffed it and he would not stop until moved his head. I thought maybe he was just getting old and just decided to interact with us more than he usually does. A couple months went by and almost everyday he's sniffing the same exact spot. We also got a Jack Russell that was rehomed around this time. After the Jack Russell warmed up to us, he also began to sniff like pressing his snout into my thigh for months too. I feel completely fine but I now believe something is there. It's a little worrying that both dogs sniff the exact same spot and won't stop until I move them or myself.

309,dogs,"TL;DR: I’m looking for a great dog shampoo recommendation. And I’m tired of shitty recommendations from sponsored ads on Google/paid articles!

I have a year old black lab. He has sensitive skin and here in Kansas, with the hard water, his skin dries and flakes terribly. 

I need some help. I’ve used a bevy of different shampoos and conditioners and everything has had next to no result. I’m not sure if my expectations are too high or whatever, but I just want him to go a few days at least without itching constantly and shaking vigorously.

I went off of a recommendation to use “oatmeal” based shampoos and conditioners from my Vet and this didn’t help. I’ve also used spray on to keep his coat moist. 

I’d really like someone that smells pleasing as well, but this isn’t necessarily a deal breaker.

On top of trying to help with his dry skin, he has been shedding so that’s a consideration as well.

Brands that I’ve tried: Wahl, Earthbath, Burt’s Bees, Natures Miracle to list a few.

315,dogs,"My husband and I are contemplating which breed is right for us after losing our beloved rescue last June. We likely won't go the breeder route, but are looking for advice on which breeds might be right for us as a starting point.

About us: 30s couple, no kids but will likely have one in the next 5 years or so. No other pets. Will never have cats (I'm severely allergic). Flexible work so can be home as much as needed. Active. Love hiking and will take our dog but we live in a major metropolitan area so we're not on the trails every weekend. Love dog training, interested in advanced obedience and possibly agility (though not a dealbreaker). Previously had a rescue husky/greyhound mix who was the light of our lives. 

Preferences: Under 55lbs (not a dealbreaker), short or flat coat, lower shedding, calm in the house, affectionate with their people, trainable, infrequent barking.

319,dogs,"Call me an idiot, call me what you want. I just want opinions since online results seem to be extremely mixed with this topic.

I have a German Shepherd, she's about 9 years old. She's been eating bones since she was baby ( I realize that alone is a very controversial topic ) anyways she's always a gentle eater and never rushes as she hasn't ever had other dogs around her to fight for the food.

Recently we've been taking care of this other dog for someone, and he always tries to steal her food. So here's the part that game me and my family a huge scare. I go out to give the dogs a bone from some wings that we had ate. My dog grabs the bone and panic swallows it in fear that the other dog would try and take it. No chewing just swallowed whole. I look at her and disbelief and right after she looks right at me and gives a small whimper. I immediately realize something is wrong and pulled her butt into the house. She starts whimpering more and I panic on how to get the bone out.

My first instinct was to to push on her stomach as I never bothered to look into what to do in that situation. Nothing, she's still whimpering I call over a family member that was near by and he comes to try and help. Her whimpering is now more intense. The thought ""I'm going to be completely useless and have to watch my dog suffocate in front of my eyes"" went through my head. At that moment when she started whimpering more my family member grabbed open her mouth and I shoved my hand into her mouth to try and grab the bone but felt nothing, after the second attempt at going on I felt the airway clear. She had swallowed it whole.

I keep hearing to take her to the vet asap while others say that she's fine. No vets are open till tomorrow morning

329,dogs,"So we have Haku who we are pretty sure is a American pitbull/Husky mix based on how his siblings look (although he himself looks nothing like his siblings and we've only seen vague pictures of his parents) he was on a raw feeding diet before we got him from my wife's older sister.

She kept all her dogs on a super strict raw feed and supplemental kibble diet that was obviously not working for Haku he was the only one of his siblings to have regular diarrhea and digestive issues so we transitioned him off of raw feeding since we aren't exactly knowledgeable or comfortable enough to do that for him 

Now the struggle begins here we went through several brands like Purina, Iams, Blue, and some other odd ones we've found at Walmart and everything had it's own issues  but we finally settled on the Rachael ray big dog kibble (which I know is not ideal and we want him to eat something else) as it's the only thing that doesn't cause him stomach issues that we've tried. Food transitions were slow over the course of a couple weeks at minimum after keeping him on one brand for at least a few weeks or so to see if he got better or more regular before switching brands, with his longest stint being the Rachael ray food he's been on for almost 6 months now with no issues other than stinky dog breath

We occasionally give him stuff like frozen blueberries and bits of apples and our two year old son is definitely responsible for the occasional treat as well when it's mealtime usually with no real issues unless it's meat products, he doesn't seem to handle meat very well. My question is what is everyone's opinion when it comes to lesser food for the sake of a dog who struggles with better quality food, would it be better to keep him on the Rachael ray food for the time being with what few snacks we can give him or should we keep trying new food in the hopes some other brand treats him well 

We've spoke with a vet who's familiar with Haku and he seems to see Haku as an ""exception"" he normally says Rachael ray big dog food would be the last thing he'd want to give a dog but since it's the first food that doesn't run from both ends out of the poor puppy he says it may be worth the risk for now but id like to see what other people think about it",t2_6jn5rbiv,0,Opinions on a dog that struggles with food,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,102ouxy,True,BoopCatt,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102ouxy/opinions_on_a_dog_that_struggles_with_food/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102ouxy/opinions_on_a_dog_that_struggles_with_food/,2478408,1672792786,0,,False,1672792805,1672792805,2023-01-04 00:39:46,,,,,,

Trigger warning : pet death , ptsd , long 

I tragically lost my sweet Roxie about 2 and a half years ago. I raised her from a pup and she was the sweetest dog you can imagine. Unfortunately there are many less than sweet dogs in my area and one of them jumped their fence and attacked us during a walk. My poor girl didn’t have a chance and I couldn’t get them off her in time. She died on the way to the emergency vet, she was only 4 and was the light of my life. I still grieve her to this day. 

My therapist brought up opening my heart and home to a new pup, but as much as I’d love to - I’m scared to go through the same thing again. The same dog is still in the neighborhood and there are many more like it. I see them wandering the streets and being posted on lost/found pages. Many of my neighbors have had their pets injured or killed as well. 

I’ve been looking at different large breeds that would be able to hold their own in the event of another attack, but for a suburban area my options are limited. Also, i fear that I wouldn’t be able to protect them while they’re a puppy so I’ve been thinking of rescuing - but a lot of breeds im looking at don’t do as well being rehomed as adults. 

Alternatively I’ve been thinking of small, low energy pups that would be okay staying inside &amp; having supervised play on my fenced patio.

This is mostly just the ptsd in me, but it almost seems like there’s no way to keep my future pet safe. I’ve seen cases of dogs breaking windows / glass doors to get at house pets. I’ve seen reports of German shepherds and other big dogs being fatally mauled. I’ve looked into moving, but it seems like restrictions are disregarded almost everywhere that has them. Even in the country livestock get killed all the time. I know that I can’t live fearing the worst, but the worst has happened before &amp; happens every day to others - it’s impossible for me to ignore and makes the idea of bringing home another pet terrifying.

I've had my little dog for three years and we've made a lot of progress together. The thing is, he's inherently fear aggressive and it takes a toll on my mental health to be with him. I got him at the humane society when he was over a year old and I wasn't told I was adopting a people-aggressive dog. I've socialized him to the best of my ability, potty trained him, leash trained him... 

After working with dog trainers and so much effort, hes made A LOT of progress, but I'm at the point where I need to accept that fear-aggression will always be part of this dogs' personality. 

Being with this dog ruins my mood just a little everyday, its like being with someone who is always in a bad mood, and the thought of being together for 10+ more years makes me feel sad, especially because I am a sociable person. 

I'm thinking about looking for a new family for him, disclosing his issues, and interviewing them to make sure they will be good to him.

336,dogs,"We have a flat coated retriever turning 12 soon, our first dog so first time experiencing him getting old. About 4/5 months ago one morning his back legs started collapsing repeatedly. We took him to the vet, ran a bunch of tests, his thyroid is slightly hypoactive and slightly overweight, over than that he was fine. Vet says it probably is just arthritis, prescribed a pain killer and thyroid meds that he is still on.
For the next 2 months he only had the occasional collapse. But then he started having a really hard time getting up the stairs into our house (4 steps to get inside). I started to have to carry him up and down the stairs. Then he started having a hard time standing up from lying down.
Took him to the vet again, said pretty much the same thing, could be arthritis or neurological, either way all we can do is manage his pain. He prescribed a different pain killer that he says is better for long term use and joint supplements.
I built a ramp for our stairs and got rubber mats for around our house to help him stand up. But his legs have still gotten worse to the point where now he can't stand up without our help. We just got a rear leg harness, but he ends up peeing on the bottom strap. After peeing or pooping he wants to just flop down in the same spot afterwards and we have to force him to walk away from it.
His bark has also gotten week sounding.
For the positives, he still has an appetite. Has no problem eating or drinking. Doesn't have accidents in the house. Going to the washroom outside normally other than the mobility issues. Can still roll around.
He doesn't seem like he's in pain. No whining. Right now whether he takes the pain killers or not doesn't seem to affect his day.

340,dogs,"I spend a lot of free time looking at dog breeds and training forums so I have a pretty good idea of what I want but I would be so appreciative if people could tell me their own thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    •    No, however all other dogs have been brought up with my parents being the ""primary owners."" My moms favorite breed is a Bouvier and our most recent Bouvier was a rescue (he bit his previous owner in the midst of a dog fight) and I have trained him very well despite getting him when he was over a year old. All in all, I have probably had 6 dogs that I have helped with and one dog that I consider to be primarily my own/I am responsible for. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder 

    •    I prefer going through a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

    •    My ideal dog is biddable (eager to please), intelligent, strong drive, medium-large, and loyal.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    •    So far I gave been interested in Giant Schnauzer's, German Shepherds, Malinois (although I don't think I can actually have one at this point), and Dobermans. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    •    Search and rescue. I have sucessfully trained multiple dogs to meet Good Canine Citizen Standards. My most recent dog is trained to detect the odor of Anise, although I have only done home training. I work in Emergency Medical Services and would love to have a dog that can do rescue work with me. And yes, I am willing to put the unbelievable amount of hours, sweat, and tears into this that I know it takes. 

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    •    Pretty much all my ""down time"" is spent with my dog. Always. Its what I love, it relaxes me and puts a smile on my face. I expect to spend at least an hour training (although probably broken up), and at least an hour finding some physical activity, just playing with them so they run around the yard, a hike...

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

    •    Probably an hour or an hour and a half. They would spend most of their time on a yard that is over an acre.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    •   I am willing to brush a couple times a week and would pay for a groomer as often as necessary.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

    •    Large. I want an intimidating dog.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    •    Shedding and barking I can deal with. I'd prefer to keep slobber to a minimum.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    •    I want a very well trained dog and I will put work into it. I don't need to let my dog be offleash but I think my other factors, well, factor into this and a dog with 0 recall doesn't really fit what I want. 

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    •    Either. I entirely understand a dog that doesn't like being snuggled, I don't either. My current dog (Bouvier) loves to give ""hugs"" and nuzzle us, though, and I definitely do not mind. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    •    Eager-to-please, this is one of the most important factors. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

    •    Any response is fine. I understand that to have a search and rescue dog I will need to sacrifice any aggression. I want an intimidating dog but any response is fine

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    •    They do not have to love other dogs by any means but they must tolerate the presence of other dogs.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    •    I do not want a dog that does not want to be trained. I want a dog that loves its job.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    •    Maybe a couple hours max. While I may work long hours my parents have stated that my dog may stay at their house anytime. They are both semi-retired and work from home (early 60s and fit, not worried about a dog knocking them over), and have a very large house and yard. Many of my dogs are elderly but I believe at least one will be alive when I get my own dog. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

    •    My parents prefer minimal shedding but I kinda suck and would get a dog that sheds a lot, I would vaccuum and they would love the dog anyways (I promise I know this, I would not get a dog if there was a chance my parents would not welcome them). My parents would be willing to let the dog out as needed and are good about understanding a dog's diet. They adhere to my training requirements (this is how you tell them to come, no food unless the dog adheres to blank). 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

    •    I plan on this dog requiring a waiting list. When I get another dog there will probably be one other large dog at the house.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    •    No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    •    Yes, but I am willing to live with my parents (no restrictions) if that means getting the dog I want until I can buy.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    •    Southern California, no bans but the hot weather is a major negative in my opinion.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    •    It can get up to 100. I am able to afford air conditioning and will provide mental stimulation / walk before it gets hot as necessary. I also have a pool I can access.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

    •    This is a dog I plan to plan well for. I expect the breeder to have a waiting list and I expect them to be selective. I will wait for the dog I want because thats how it goes.

345,dogs,"So I was planning to board both my dogs but it's just not really working out and can only get only boarded. I have no one I trust to watch the one I can't board, he's a bit of an escape artist. So we decided to fly with him. At first I wasn't worried about cargo but then I got worried about something going wrong, him getting lost, etc so I'm extremely nervous about that now. So next option is bringing him in cabin, as he's a small dog. Now the flights aren't long, the first is 2hrs ish, small layover and then another 2hrs ish flight. But problem is my dog is extremely anxious around strangers and especially when he has to be in a crate. Now if I can like shove my finger in the crate and pet him he'd probably calm down enough. But I don't think that's possible given you're not allowed to unzip carriers so I can't pet him to calm him down.

I've heard of getting maybe anxiety medicine or a mild sedative for the flight to calm him. Because I don't want him barking and ruining everything's day. Though I will say people always say to be understanding of when babies cry yet when it's a dog everyone treats the owner like pieces of shit and judge them. When doesn't seem fair since they're also doing everything they can to make this work and it's not like we want our dog to bark either. But I'm worried about medicine, for one if it doesn't work then it was kinda a waste to make my dog take it. But also idk what if it has some weird side effect.

I don't know anyone whose flown with their dogs especially not anyone who has an anxious dog like mine. And I'm the type who likes to hear from other people in a similar situation to feel reassured. I've been googling and googling to no avail. Alot of the articles I read actively insulted and judged people who bring their dogs in cabin if they're anxious or vocal.

346,dogs,"      I rescued Sage right before the cold snap(-25° windchill, 3 days of under 20°) about 2 weeks ago. I found her at an apartment complex of mine while  salting my tenants stairs. I saved her life from hypothermia. I checked with the vet and she isn't spayed yet if that makes any difference with her trying to mark her territory( i have a 2 year old nuetured male who knows how to hold it.

      Literally I went to the store for 45 mins and she peed on the potty training pads (which is better than it was when I first brought her home, she would pee right in front of my GF and I and we would catch her in the act, tell her no and take her outside) this was after I let her out for about 15 mins so she can do her business. When I got home she still had peed on the pads.

      Should I crate train her when I'm at work bc we expect her to at least pee and maybe poop one time while we are both at work. My gf works about 10 mins away from our house and comes home on her lunch break but that's still about 3.5 to 4hrs that Sage will have to hold it. This dog has clearly been abused and prolly left out to die bc she's not potty trained, I'd really like to keep her and mentally rehabilitate her so she's not skidish.

Before then he spent a month at another house and before that he might have been a stray and god knows what happened to him. But the humping and marking are the things I can’t figure out.

349,dogs,"Looking for an addition to our family when our current pup is approaching two. Looking to go the breeder route and many reputable ones have a long waitlist, so we plan on researching over winter to make a decision a year out. Our current dog is a Malamute/GSD/Pyr mix and 7.5 months old. She loves other dogs and has taken obedience and tricks class. We would love to see if she would like agility/rally when she’s a year old. 

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. Only child helping raise dogs my entire life (Samoyed, collie golden mix and husky golden mix), a shepherd lab mix as an adult, and now my current dog. 

2)         Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

Breeder preferred. Not against a rescue. 

3)         Describe your ideal dog.

Snuggly biddable velcro dog that can keep up with my current pup. 

4)         What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

High energy but not neurotic. As much as I love huskies and aussies, that crosses them off. Based on some of the pups we have seen in our group classes, Golden retriever, toller, show line GSD, love spitz breeds (I love Finnish lapphunds but I know they are hard to find state side). Open to suggestions but no bully breeds or poodles (any oodles ). 

5)         What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

We plan on taking our current dog in obedience classes up to CGC and she just got her novice tricks title. I love training and my current dog loves having a job. I would like our next dog to do the same. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Sport for sure, not work. Although I would like to teach my current dog to pull a cart or canicross.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We both work from home and our current dog is definitely our all day buddy. We use her meals for training and puzzles in addition to walks, fetch, flirt pole. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Currently we are focused more on mental stimulation because our girl is a frustrated greeter. Looking to spend more time on walks as her loose lease walking improves. We have a dog park that isn’t heavily used for fetch and trails. We can commit to 2 walks a day, an hour of training, and 30-60 minutes fetch and playing. 


9)         How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We prefer floofs and are willing to do the maintenance and take them to the groomers. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)       What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large, but not so big there’s a diminished life span. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber is fine. Prefer talking and grumbling over incessant barking. 

\* ANSWER

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Recall will be trained regardless. Probably wouldn’t want a hound that is keen to follow a smell and ignore me. 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Alert barking and cautious until told it’s okay. Friendly after that. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* No.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

A few hours a week for social engagement. When the weather is nice here we would bring the dogs. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Full agreement and care. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

2 cats (Maine coon and an Asian breed mix), 1 dog (GSD/malamute/Pyr)

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No and we don’t plan on any children. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I own a home

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Humid continental. 80s in summer, 30s in winter

353,dogs,"Hi! 

I'm going to be starting classes for my MBA next week, and I was hoping to ask for some advice about crating my puppy while I'm on campus and how to work his dinner schedule around it.

It's a 2hr class with a 20min commute (2-3hrs, 3 1/2hrs max total), 2 days a week. I WFH the rest of the time. My puppy is 7 months old. He's great in his crate - no accidents, no whining, no barking, totally fine. He doesn't go in there to hang out if the door is open, but he doesn't mind being in there. He doesn't really seem to entertain himself very often when he's in there, just kind of hangs out til I let him out. I put him in there once or twice every day. If I'm going somewhere, I'll put him in twice - once where I stay home, and once where I leave. I often watch him on our baby cam and all is quiet (it has a mic as well so I can hear him). 

The bit I'm looking for advice on is regarding the timing of the class. It's at 5:20pm, which is exactly when I've been feeding puppy dinner. I'm working on adjusting his napping schedule so he's happy to nap or chill from 4:40/5pm until a bit before 8pm, but 8pm feels super late to be feeding him with a 10pm bedtime. On the other hand, I can't feed him at 4:30 and  then shut the poor thing in his crate for 3hrs. 

I have no one to watch him while I'm gone and I'm not able to afford to hire someone at the moment. It's just a weird timing thing, I'm not really too worried about how much time he'll be in there, just about when to feed him dinner. Could I split dinner into two smaller meals?

Problem behaviors: 

- He is on a special diet for digestion. He doesn't hate it but it's certainly not as good as the wet/dry combo that my dog gets and he will push my dog away from her food. 
- He will randomly attack the other cat and our dog. Nothing major but he lets them know he's there. 
- He wants to be the only one getting attention and will chase off the other pets if we are giving them love.

363,dogs,"I had to go out of town for 1 week to somewhere where I could not bring my 1 year old pup. I have a daycare/boarding facility that she frequents (not often, but anytime I will be gone for 3+ hours, I bring her there) but she has never stayed for more than 3 nights at a time. She absolutely loves it there. She is an extremely social pup and she loves to get to play with her friends; I trust the staff as well. However, for this one week stay I had to bring her to a different location (same daycare/company, different city) and she was extremely nervous going in. This made me very nervous, but every time I called to check in on her throughout the week they said she was doing great and I was receiving daily report cards with photos of her playing and smiley.

The day of New Year’s eve I picked her up from the daycare without a scratch, and she seemed fine. Whenever she comes home from a board she is exhausted from partying all night and usually sleeps for an absurd amount of time afterward and wakes up good as new. So when I picked her up she went straight to bed as usual. My boyfriend spent the night which she is pretty used to by now, and she slept through the night with us. 

The next day (Dec 1) we woke up, she was still doing well and acting normally. My boyfriend and I took her over to his house just to spend the day there. In hindsight, this may have been a lapse in judgment as it might have just been too much for her. I did not think anything of it because she usually loves going to his house and we all just hung out on the couch all day (minus walks). 

It started being strange when she was sitting only on my boyfriends side cuddling him. She never does this, she always sits on my side or in between us both; she has to be cuddling me. She is pretty attached to me, and very much a one human dog (she likes other people like my family and boyfriend, but she is heavily bonded to me and does not like to leave my side. 

My pup and I went home that night, just us two, and went to sleep cuddling. I woke up (this is yesterday now) and she was on the other corner of the bed and I was surprised bc usually we have to be full body cuddling all night long. She woke up and we went for a walk, we came back and i opened up a bottle of pills and she darted under my bed hiding. I thought she thought I was gonna give her medicine and got scared and I laughed it off. She came out 20 mins later and laid down far away from me. A while later I opened up a food bag and she darted under the bed again. This was extremely strange for her. When she came out again, she cautiously jumped on the bed and I quietly looked at her and said “good girl” and she went straight back under. It progressed to the point where if I even make eye contact w her she would run away in fear. 

As of today this is still happening but I am doing my best to work with her because I am heartbroken. She is usually the cuddliest dog in the world and obsessed w me (and I w her). Now I cannot even touch or look at her or she looks at me as if I am about to beat her senseless. 

When she hides under the bed I absolutely cannot lure her out with anything. treats, leash for walks, toys, etc. I am trying to give her space and let her warm back up to me. I think it is slowly getting better, but I am pretty freaked out.  I am slowly being allowed some pets here and there and she is coming on the bed for super short periods of time and staying fat away from me. I am thinking this is due to her being upset that I left her for so long, and then maybe that I took her out of the house so soon after. There is truly nothing I could do about the 1 week stay, but I know now I should not have brought her to my bf’s house. 

Please does anybody have any better insight into what might be going on than I do? Is this relatively normal under the circumstances and with love and patience will she return to her normal loving and loyal (certainly not afraid of me) self? Is there anything I can do to help her feel more comfortable again?

367,dogs,"I had to go out of town for 1 week to somewhere where I could not bring my 1 year old pup. I have a daycare/boarding facility that she frequents (not often, but anytime I will be gone for 3+ hours, I bring her there) but she has never stayed for more than 3 nights at a time. She absolutely loves it there. She is an extremely social pup and she loves to get to play with her friends; I trust the staff as well. However, for this one week stay I had to bring her to a different location (same daycare/company, different city) and she was extremely nervous going in. This made me very nervous, but every time I called to check in on her throughout the week they said she was doing great and I was receiving daily report cards with photos of her playing and smiley.

The day of New Year’s eve I picked her up from the daycare without a scratch, and she seemed fine. Whenever she comes home from a board she is exhausted from partying all night and usually sleeps for an absurd amount of time afterward and wakes up good as new. So when I picked her up she went straight to bed as usual. My boyfriend spent the night which she is pretty used to by now, and she slept through the night with us. 

The next day (Dec 1) we woke up, she was still doing well and acting normally. My boyfriend and I took her over to his house just to spend the day there. In hindsight, this may have been a lapse in judgment as it might have just been too much for her. I did not think anything of it because she usually loves going to his house and we all just hung out on the couch all day (minus walks). 

It started being strange when she was sitting only on my boyfriends side cuddling him. She never does this, she always sits on my side or in between us both; she has to be cuddling me. She is pretty attached to me, and very much a one human dog (she likes other people like my family and boyfriend, but she is heavily bonded to me and does not like to leave my side. 

My pup and I went home that night, just us two, and went to sleep cuddling. I woke up (this is yesterday now) and she was on the other corner of the bed and I was surprised bc usually we have to be full body cuddling all night long. She woke up and we went for a walk, we came back and i opened up a bottle of pills and she darted under my bed hiding. I thought she thought I was gonna give her medicine and got scared and I laughed it off. She came out 20 mins later and laid down far away from me. A while later I opened up a food bag and she darted under the bed again. This was extremely strange for her. When she came out again, she cautiously jumped on the bed and I quietly looked at her and said “good girl” and she went straight back under. It progressed to the point where if I even make eye contact w her she would run away in fear. 

As of today this is still happening but I am doing my best to work with her because I am heartbroken. She is usually the cuddliest dog in the world and obsessed w me (and I w her). Now I cannot even touch or look at her or she looks at me as if I am about to beat her senseless. 

When she hides under the bed I absolutely cannot lure her out with anything. treats, leash for walks, toys, etc. I am trying to give her space and let her warm back up to me. I think it is slowly getting better, but I am pretty freaked out.  I am slowly being allowed some pets here and there and she is coming on the bed for super short periods of time and staying fat away from me. I am thinking this is due to her being upset that I left her for so long, and then maybe that I took her out of the house so soon after. There is truly nothing I could do about the 1 week stay, but I know now I should not have brought her to my bf’s house. 

Please does anybody have any better insight into what might be going on than I do? Is this relatively normal under the circumstances and with love and patience will she return to her normal loving and loyal (certainly not afraid of me) self? Is there anything I can do to help her feel more comfortable again?

370,dogs,"Hi everyone!

My parents’ beloved miniature dachshund recently had a bad injury from falling off the couch and needed spinal surgery. Ever since, my mom is a totally nervous wreck and even though he is healing really well she is terrified of him injuring himself again. She hardly puts him down which I personally find to be selfish and not helpful because he needs some autonomy and is developing separation anxiety. 

The biggest hazard is keeping him off the couch, and he is hardly trained. He isn’t even potty trained. It’s a literal mess. 

I suggested that they use the large pen they bought for post surgery to actually go around the sectional couch so he has free range otherwise. Basically, box in the couch and humans unless they want him on the couch. Do you have any other tips?

373,dogs,"Hey all. Soon (as in a few months) I am planning to adopt a dog. I have been waiting until my living situation is settled and until I have the time to dedicate to my pup and I have lots of experience with dogs (family dogs and I’m a dog walker / pet sitter) so I am preparing to have my own dog. I am totally not for rushing into anything and will dedicate time to my dog. So my lifestyle is like 

1. I am moving into an NYC apartment. Doing my best to find a location near a large dog park. 

2. I live an active lifestyle despite my location, I walk everyday and would like a dog that I can play fetch at a dog park with and that can also go off leash when safe / appropriate 

3. A dog that is capable of hiking as I go hiking almost every weekend. A dog that is able to keep up would be awesome. 

4. Potentially minimize shedding? Or minimize mess (for example a golden retriever along coat that can get muddy, wet, dirty, etc) Definitely the least of my worries and would prioritize other needs over this just an afterthought 

If there’s anything else I’ll make edits or comments.

Now dogs I have considered and are interested in are corgis, border collies, labs, vizsla, boykin spaniel…(especially collies / corgis) 

And onto what I’m worried about with some of the breeds. For collies, they are truly my dream dog. However I would not want to force owning one if it seems unreasonable or unfair to have one living in the city. I am aware walks alone would not be enough stimulation and sadly I’m worried playing fetch for an hour or two a day and hiking only on weekends still wouldn’t be enough. For corgis, the health issues, expenses / cost, and I would need to educate myself on a few of their quirks. Labs are great however I have had many labs in my life and am interested in raising a different kind of dog. Vizla’s seem great but still would need to educate myself on them more. Same with boykin spaniel.

We adopted a pupup from the shelter mid-December - he's a 5 month old mix (looks like canaan/short hair white german shepherd) and the shelter requires us to not let him out of the house until Jan 15 for a 30 day distemper watch (he used to have canine distemper; but now is completely vaccinated and this quarantine is to just look out for symptoms)

Because of this quarantine, he's only seen my partner and I and no other humans or dogs for the past 2 weeks. He's made great strides because he was terrified of my male partner on Day 1 but now they are cuddle buds! 

We are so excited and desperate to take him out on walks; staying at home - there's only so much mental stimulation and exercise he can get :( He cant seem to focus for practicing training commands and doesn't seem to be too treat motivated - mid training he loses interest and goes back to his crate to do something else. 

Anyway, we tried putting on a collar on him to get him used to it and he got so terrified the first day; we then switched his collar for a lighter one and now he doesn't even seem to realize that its on and is fine. Yesterday we just tied a pajama string to this collar as a leash to see how he feels about it; he was so terrified he hid under the bed and then slept in his crate and didn't respond to any treats (even high value like peanut butter). He was fine a few hours later after we gave him some cheese bits.

 The distemper quarantine is really biting into the very crucial period of his socialization. This is our first pup and we really really love him and want to help him out.

381,dogs,"Hello fellow dog admirers!  


I live in a small town in Eastern Europe and it is very common here for people to keep their dogs outside in their backyards at night. So, for the last couple of years, my family and I noticed something weird. Every once in a while (maybe 3 nights per week) the neighbourhood dogs start howling simultaneously (one starts and the other follow him with a weird algorithm). The howling lasts for about a minute, sometimes even longer and suddenly they all stop in one second and then don't do it anymore. It is weird because they all stop at this one exact moment, like somebody just cut them off. Now, I know dogs bark/howl at night because of boredom or they're just  **responding to noises in the environment,** but this one seems different. It's worth mentioning that only happens at night, not during daytime. Since we've never encountered something like that before, I am wondering if anyone else heard the same situation or anybody knows anything about this topic?

382,dogs,"I’ve been dating a guy with a 2yo male labradoodle for about 3 months who we’ll call “M”. I have a 6yo female golden retriever who we’ll call “G.” For some background, M is not aggressive but definitely territorial. Anytime G gets close to my boyfriend or he gives her attention, M starts barking and wedges himself between them. He also barks relentlessly at her anytime she’s in “his spot” on the couch. G is generally not territorial towards anything other than toys or bones. Recently, we’ve been finding pee spots in the middle of my boyfriend’s bed and in several of the upstairs rooms. We found poop twice which I do suspect was G. G does have a history of occasionally pooping indoors when she’s in new environments (a few times at my parents and a few times at an ex-boyfriends). I always suspected this was out of stress or excitement, because it wasn’t a recurring behavior and she’s never once peed indoors since I’ve had her. I reached out to some of my friends who have watched her over the years (including ones who have other dogs and ones without) and they all confirmed she never once had an accident or marked in their house. Boyfriend claims that G is the one peeing upstairs which I find hard to believe given her history. It seems more likely to me that M is stressed out about having a new dog in his home and marking his territory. Also of note, neither G nor M has had any accidents in my apartment. Does anyone have any advice or guidance on how to deal with this? Boyfriend is unwilling to entertain the possibility that M is the one marking, so that rules out crating both dogs when we’re gone, etc. So any intervention would have to be with the assumption G is the one responsible for the accidents.",t2_64fjjrf0,0,Unsure which of two dogs is having accidents and how to move forward,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,102h396,True,maggiebug165,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102h396/unsure_which_of_two_dogs_is_having_accidents_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102h396/unsure_which_of_two_dogs_is_having_accidents_and/,2478296,1672774417,0,,False,1672774434,1672774435,2023-01-03 19:33:37,,,,,,

390,dogs,"**Background**: I recently moved back home with my parents/family. Our family dog (beagle/hound mix) Melon has been weary of strangers and vets from the start. She was adopted and had to fend for herself on the streets when she was a puppy and it seems that she hasn’t “shook” her defensive behavior. Semi-socialized with other dogs (has a select few dog friends and gets along with my male dog, but never has done well at the dog park). It takes multiple visits from outside family and friends for Melon to warm up to them/stop growling and barking. She is almost 10, for reference and she was adopted at 6 months. 

**Problem/question**: Now that I’m living back at home, I’m noticing that one of Melon’s molars looks really bad. It looks covered in plaque or something (not a professional so I have no clue but her tooth and gum area look bad), not to mention her breath is awful. She also has a mole (can dog’s get moles?) that was once pink but is now black. My mom took her to the vet back in June for vaccines but apparently the vet said her teeth “look fine,” but honestly, I feel like my mom is lying. My family LOVES Melon but they kind of skimp out on vet / health visits which I am not in favor of. I want to bring Melon to the vet for her teeth (and to get her mole thing looked at) as soon as they have an opening and while Melon is terrified of the vet, the visits usually go OK as she wears a soft muzzle (according to my mom). But we are afraid that Melon will bite the vet or vet tech when they examine her teeth, not out of aggression but out of fear. Aside from putting her under anesthesia (my parents are not going to want to pay for that) is there another way we can prevent her from potentially biting someone at the vet? If there is no other way to examine her teeth without anesthesia, will she get put down if she does bite the vet? I’m nervous but I care about her health too much to postpone any more vet visits.

391,dogs,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* I had a Boston Terrier before and I trained it by myself. I am willing to pay for training.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

\* Living in an apartment, but I am looking for a breeder

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

\* size, energy, shedding, grooming, exercise, barking: low or moderate. I do these tasks with my cats, but I don't want it to be a huge daily hustle. Looking for a breed apartment friendly, good with kids and other animals (cats). I work as home office, but would prefer a dog that goes well alone or in a pet place during vacation time. Dog with a breed that doesn't have much health issues, since I am against purely aesthetics breeding that cause dogs to have health issues. Preferably a more mainstream breed and not mixed breeding since it may be hard to find in my country of residence

\* I will be home all day to attend for the necessities of the dog, but I expect it to be a low/average maintenance dog

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* chihuahua, English bulldog. Not super experienced on dog breeds. Open for suggestions.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* indoor toilet, low barking, avoid separation anxiety, do decently with other animals and kids, do well in a pet place during vacation time

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No competition, just the average apartment dog

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Paid puppy school is fine, paid puppy place is fine, I will also do my own training like I did with my last dog. I don't mind going through some daily duties, but I don't want to be a huge effort.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

\* up to 1h per day in my apartment or the street. Dog park every few days.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Paid professional is fine for me. I can also brush every now and then.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* small or medium, up to 25 kg, as long as it fits in an apartment.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I don't mind a little shedding, barking and slobber, but I don't want it to be a huge issue

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not important at all

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Both are fine, but I plan on having kids and want them to be connected to the dog

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Both are fine, but I plan on having kids and want them to be connected to the dog

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

\* Friendly behavior is preferred. I don't need a guard dog. If it is not friendly it is fine, as long as it is not aggressive

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* Yes, but prefer not to

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Too much barking could be a problem in the apartment

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* not often. I do home office. But I also don't want a dog that is too needy in that sense. Separation anxiety gets me stressed.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

\* I work from home. There are other people in the apartment capable of taking care of the dog, but I will be the main one

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* Cats we adopted from the streets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* yes, my future child

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* no restrictions, besides my own (not above 25kg or not capable of fitting in an apartment)

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Yes. No breeds are banned, but I am looking for mainstream ones, since they may not be available in the country I live in

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* summer: 30 degrees celcius. Winter: 15 degrees celsius without indoor heating

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",t2_rz31d,0,[Breeds] Looking for suggestions,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,102gu11,True,iamsubs,,2,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102gu11/breeds_looking_for_suggestions/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102gu11/breeds_looking_for_suggestions/,2478289,1672773802,0,,False,1672773816,1672773817,2023-01-03 19:23:22,,,,,,

He won't go on walks if I don't go with him, he won't respond to treats or food unless I stay with him, and he doesn't sleep when we try to leave him alone. He ignores everybody else and actually starts growling when someone tries to remove him from my side. At first I thought he simply liked me but all he does is hump me. He doesn't lay down for me to pet him. I don't know how to train him not to do that and I'm hesitant on teaching someone elses dog a command. He whimpers outside of my bedroom door until I come out. He's been like this fot 12 hours now. Is this normal? And how do I deal with it? Again, apologies for an almost identical post back to back.

402,dogs,"Has anyone here dealt with teenage behavioural shifts that seemed to come out of no where? 

4 months ago we rehomed a neutered 8 month old staffordshire bull terrier, so he's 13 months now, he had a few issues when we got him like still being a heavy mouther and other stuff but nothing too concerning and we worked with a private trainer and he now goes to a weekly classes where he's a star pupil. Not perfect by any means, he's a right big ball of energy, loves a shoe to chew on and is a total attention seeker, but we're working on it and he's a general good boy! 

One of the things I always loved most about him is he's great with other dogs, loves a play with them or can just ignore them, no aggression, ever, dogs could be super reactive to him and he'd just trot by completely unphased. 

But with in the last 2 weeks over the xmas break he's suddenly developed a dislike to some small white fluffy dogs, out of no where, he's never had a fight or been attacked, there are even some small white dogs in his class. But over the last 2 weeks while walking past a couple of these dogs he's got into 'stalking pose' his hackles have gone up, his eyes are locked on and he's started snarling and lunging. The other dogs weren't showing any aggression either, completly non reactive, so it really caught me off guard! 

Anyone else experienced anything like this, its quite jarring to see your pups behaviour change? Or have tips to cut this behaviour off so it hopefully doesnt continue or escalate?

He basically really loves eating boiled chicken and we mix it with his kibble otherwise he wouldn't really eat. Currently the breeder had him on Royal Canin but his own special version (as it's apparently smaller size than the usual ones) but it's very inconvinent to get from him and it costs alot more. So I'm thinking of still sticking to Royal Canin but getting maybe either the poodle version or mini indoors. But I am worried that the food may not be too his liking or may be too big for him.

408,dogs,"Hi All,

So I'm a 25 year old single man in a 2 bed apartment in a fairly small building (easy access to outside). 

I've been here a year and recently I've been considering getting a dog. We've always had small-medium sized dogs but family have also owned large dogs so there's nothing really new to me size wise.

My friend in a similarly sized property has just bought a lab puppy, so that got me thinking and researching. I've always wanted a smarter dog on that sort of level so wondered if I can make it work, which it seems I may be able to as I've got an active lifestyle and plenty of nearby parks/lakes/areas to walk a dog.

The largest issue I seem to have is what I do when I'm not at home. I work in London 3 days a week and I do not believe in leaving a dog alone for anything longer than a few hours (I'll be out at least 9+ hours), regardless of breed or what the internet says, therefore I'll likely be reliant on my parents nearby to step in and help out. The problem with this is they are more small/medium dog owners (Currently own a Cocker Spaniel, previously had a Shih Tzu, you get the idea) so I think they're not overly keen on the lab idea or anything in that range. 

I'm trying to find a breed that suits the smart/trainable/not too big for my parents to manage whilst also avoiding the breeds with inherent problems with the breathing and the squished faces - been there before and I know it's not fun.

Anyone got any thoughts on this?

410,dogs,"I have an almost three year old husky-shepherd mix. She gets along well with other dogs her size. She goes to doggy daycare a couple of times a week and seems to get the dog social rules. She is very sweet and generally well behaved. 

She has a really high prey drive and has caught and killed several rabbits in our yard. Because of this, I usually take her to the dog park for exercise instead of walks because she spends the whole walk trying to go after the bunnies in the neighbourhood. She's generally great at the dog park. She loves people and mostly runs around getting pets. She'll play ball and isn't really concerned about sharing if another dog gets it first. 

However, she has a very low tolerance for little dogs. I don't know if this is a prey thing (because they obviously smell like dogs, not bunnies) or because little dogs don't seem to follow the same social rules as bigger dogs. She'll sniff with them but sometimes it ends up with her snarling and snapping.

I'm worried about getting a puppy and her treating it like this and not like an uneducated baby. Has anyone else been in this situation? Obviously I won't leave them unattended together until I know they will be okay, but I want to set my girl up for success.

I take him out frequently and put down pads but he isn't trained for pads and sometimes he just refuses to go outside especially at night. Even when he goes out at night sometimes he won't go until I put him back in.

 He's crate trained and won't sleep anywhere but the crate. Absolutely will not sleep he'll just stand next to the crate until I let him in it. The problem is he's constantly peeing in his crate and on his bedding because of these issues. Even if I leave the crate open at night so he can come out and not pee in his bedding he won't come out. So every single day he pees on his bedding. Even if I wash it and the plastic pan at the bottom of the crate I can't get rid of the smell. And because of my schedule washing fresh bedding every single time he pees just isn't viable. For some reason he doesn't seem bothered by it in the least, maybe he takes comfort in the smell??? I have no clue. He won't do diapers either he tears them off in the night and I worry he'll do it while I'm sleeping and eat something bad or choke himself.

Early December, I brought him to the vet so he can get his updated vaccines and also an anal gland expression since I have never done it before. And the next day, he started having diahrrea and a bit of bloody poop. The blood would come out after his diahrrea, so it looks separate from the diahrrea  It happened for a week or so and I told the vet. They told me that he was just feeling stressed from the shots and to continue the chicken, rice, pumpkin diet for the time. But I was concerned and called the vet again few days later. They told me to give him probiotics and antiobiotics to help him. And eventually, it did go away. But a week or two later it came back again. I’m not sure what is causing it since he has been having the same brand of kibbles (nutro) for the longest time. Yesterday, he threw up a bit of his breakfast and he also had diahrrea with some blood again. I decided to take him to the emergency hospital. The vet told me that anything can be causing the diahrrea. They checked his anal gland and it was fine. But the vet gave him two shots and another type of probiotic to take home.  

He still does have the energy to move around and play. And also an appetitie to eat. It is just that i’m not sure what is causing his diahrrea and the blood. The vet said doing a blood work test wouldn’t show what would be causing the diahrrea. And she mentioned I could try finding a specialist to take a look inside of him.

417,dogs," 

**Introduction**

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* Yes. My wife (29) and I (28) are looking to adopt our first puppy! (Some of the answers are taken from the previous post because they fit my situation as well so apologize for that) 

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

* Reputable breeder but open to rescuing. 

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

* Loyal, obedient, protective 

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* We have looked into Border collies, Australian shepherds, and German shepherds but we removed collies out of the list after seeing how energetic they are (even tho we live an active lifestyle). We read into Australian and German that they are loyal and eager to learn new tricks everyday.  

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

* Basic commands (Sit, lay down, high five), recalls, as well as fetch ( I Loved playing fetch with my friends dog) 

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport or use your dog for a form of work? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* No experience or need for this, but I'd consider Agility, Obedience.

**Care Commitments**

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* I work hybrid and my wife works remote so we will be interacting with the dog daily but training, I would give 2-3 hours a day 

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

* Two 30min walks  or 1 hour walk around the neighbourhood + a few sessions of fetch throughout the day. Weekends would add another 30-60min walk.  We also like hiking biweekly (when the weather is nice) and going to the beach as well! 

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* I already do this work with both of my cats and it became a habit and oddly satisfying to see them clean lol (one of my cats sheds crazy!). we are also willing to take the dog for grooming once a month 

**Personal Preferences**

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**

* Medium - Large

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* I am okay with shedding. Play/alert barking is fine, but no yapping/howling. No slobber!.

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Very important 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**13t) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* As snuggly as possible without having separation anxiety or minimal. 

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

* Eager-to-please.

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* I do like my dog to be alerted and cautious until i let them know its okay to greet strangers and be friendly with them. 

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* No,  I would like to socialize my dog with other dogs as much as possible 

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

* Pestering (or being pestered by) our cats is our #1 deal-breaker. They don't need to be BFFs and we anticipate and adjustment period, but they must peacefully coexist. ( I copied this from the previous post) 

**Lifestyle**

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

* A couple hours of errands a few days a week. We're homebodies but would make alone-time part of training in order to avoid issues on the occasional night out. it's possible we might have to show up in office some days during the week ( 8 hours max), we thought of getting a dog walker during that time. 

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* N/A. No one else lives with us.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

* Yes, we have two kittens (currently 7 months old) 

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* We have no children, but we are planning to have a baby as well as nieces that comes over sometimes during the weekends. 

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* No restriction in our current rent. 

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* USA, No. 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Summer: 25°C ,  Winter: 9°C 

**Additional Information and Questions**

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

* We enjoy walking outside a lot. I usually like putting music on and can walk forever and I enjoy playing fetch with my friends dog a lot, and I know this might sound silly but it helps A LOT with my mental health. When I feel down, I go take a walk outside and envy people playing fetch with their dogs. 

**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**

* Please let us know any other breeds we can look into as well (There's soo many breeds! )",t2_4rlnpykm,0,[Breeds] First time owner looking for MEDIUM - LARGE breed,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,102cang,True,SlowCheetah654,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102cang/breeds_first_time_owner_looking_for_medium_large/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102cang/breeds_first_time_owner_looking_for_medium_large/,2478240,1672763127,0,,False,1672763144,1672763145,2023-01-03 16:25:27,,,,,,
418,dogs,"I  have two labs that are my world. We live in an apartment on a busy street. Our living room opens in  a fenced patio area. My boys love hanging out on the porch, people/dog, watching, and just getting sniffs. However, Gus is bad about barking anytime he sees a person (with or without a dog) walking by. He's very friendly and loves people. I think is just trying to get the person's because he sort of wags his tail as he barks. This causes the other dog, Brady, to start barking only because of the first dog barking. He doesn't really care about people (loves animals though). Which in turn causes me to frantically run out there and try and stop the barking. They don't bark at everyone or every dog which makes me think it's not a territorial thing; I'm not sure why they bark at certain people/dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are : 

1) Any suggestions for preventing the barking (or stopping it easily) so they don't look like crazy mean dogs (c'mon they're labs and would even give a stranger death by a thousand licks)

2) Should I work on the way I react? As in just know dogs are dogs, the people walking past or people walking their dogs should be ok with them barking since they're contained?

3) Am I being overly anxious and paranoid by the barking?

Gus - yellow lab, male, 9 yo, lover of all things food and people

Brady - chocolate lab, male, 8yo, he only loves his bed and his mom and he's not sorry (and other animals, loves them, shy around strangers)",t2_h8h2a9v4,0,Dogs barking at everything!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,102c28w,True,sportyphysicist,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/102c28w/dogs_barking_at_everything/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/102c28w/dogs_barking_at_everything/,2478239,1672762554,0,,False,1672762567,1672762568,2023-01-03 16:15:54,,,,,,

422,dogs,"Background : We have two hounds that are 100% rescue pets. They have been healthy and mostly well behaved except the blue tick is a trash fiend Houdini. She has broken into the kitchen (custom 4 foot tall gate) and opened an entire box of microwaveable ravioli cups, and opened the cups and ate the pasta. Egg shells are her favorite, shrimp tails a close second. She is a bottomless pit and bullet proof. So she is kenneled at night and when we are not home. She hates her expensive dog food, but we feed them special food because her sister is an inbred blood hound that is allergic to air. So she occasionally will go on “hunger strike” and we have resorted to adding chicken broth or sometimes we can get away with just water, to her dry kibble to get her to eat it. She is healthy, has been about five lbs too heavy. Regularly dewormed  as we have cats and they stay on flea/heart worm etc. shots up to date. I say all of this because up to this point she has had no health issues or scares despite being a little bit of a trouble maker. 

I keep a towel under the kennel tray between the tray and the kennel itself to dampen the sound of the tray tapping on the bottom of the kennel. It is not even visible. Xmas eve eve she somehow got a hold of the towel and chewed and ate a portion of it and vomited it up. We found it in her kennel the morning of Xmas eve. She didn’t want to eat but was drinking. She vomited a couple of times. Vet visit the day after Xmas. X-rays confirmed no blockage. Vet gave us nausea meds to last four days and said her tummy might be irritated and to give her a few days to recover and gain back appetite. 

She ate almost nothing between Xmas and new years. One runny bowel movement. We bought canned food, cooked her bacon, offered chicken nuggets. She acts like she wants to eat but won’t chew or in some cases will chew and won’t swallow. Like either her teeth or throat? She allows us access to her teeth, we felt around and tapped and pushed and could not get a reaction. She continued to drink and pee, but would not eat. On Sunday I resorted to a plastic syringe, I have a bunch I use to deworm foster kittens, they come sealed, I used a new one to syringe feed her just chicken broth, then a broth/canned food slurry. Small amounts at a time. Continued through Monday morning when she started to drink the slurry on her own, just a little bit and also accepted some deli meat. Got some more canned food but it is stew type not pate and she won’t eat. So Monday night she was acting a lot better over all and had a bowel movement, small but almost normal, and had maybe a cup of slurry through the day. Was acting nauseous at bed time. Gave one pill. This morning she went out to potty, and threw up bile. No blood or foam Would not eat and had to syringe feed broth. Gave nausea pill with peanut butter, which she didn’t want but is the best way to get her to take the pill. That was the last nausea pill we had. Good news is it seems she is passing food out of her tummy. How long do we allow her to refuse to eat/syringe feed her? Should she go back to the vet? She will sometimes gag when you offer food. She is obviously hungry. As I stated before she has moods and will refuse to eat but this being accompanied with nausea is not normal. Do I get a 2nd opinion? And if I do get a 2nd opinion what should I ask the vet to do? If there isn’t a blockage and she doesn’t have a diagnosable sickness, what tests should be ran? how much time is reasonable for her to feel not well?",t2_5hxh4qae,0,"How long before I get a 2nd vet opinion?

I have a 15, almost 16-year-old, miniature Schnoodle. He began experiencing issues with his hind legs over the summer. They were very minor issues, just occasional dragging of his back paw as he was walking. Over the past few weeks, though, and after slipping and falling on the slippery floors at home, he has been having much more difficulty with his back left leg.  He's knuckling a lot more frequently, his leg seems stiff, and he just overall seems to be having a lot more difficulty balancing on that leg. This has resulted in him losing his balance on multiple occasions while pottying and having some trouble lifting his leg. He does not at all seem to be in pain and he has no problem running around on his leg and playing. I already took him to the vet, who said it seems to be a combination of arthritis and a luxating patella (we've known of this issue for several year now, but it hasn't really bothered him until more recently) in that leg. We were sent home with anti-inflammatory medicine, which he is supposed to take for the next week and then on an as-need basis.

Since his leg issues seem to be getting a bit worse, I've been doing some research online, and I cam across these leg braces and sleeves.  They all help with similar, albeit slightly different issues, including knuckling and hock support. I feel like they could be a great option for my dog, and I am planning to make an appointment with the vet to discuss them. However, I was just curious to see if anyone else who has a dog with arthritis or a luxating patella, or similar issues, has used these or something similar. If so, what was your experience with them? Do you think they helped your dog at all?

I absolutely hate seeing my dog struggling with his back leg, especially since up until these issues began, he was always so active and he clearly still wants to run around like he used to.

437,dogs,"I’ve tried dog therapists, vets and everything I can think of. Nothing helps.

My Cumbrian Trailhound is nearly 11, and in his younger years was the easiest dog I’ve ever had.

Now, he is scared of every noise which sends him into a state of panic and self destruct.

He hates the noise of silverwear when we are eating and runs upstairs and destroys the house. 

He was always a great dog in the car, now for no reason at all he panics and self destructs. Jumping out of the back, over the seats and tries to claw at me whilst driving. And yes he was secured and broke out such is his strength and fear. I drove through a puddle the other day and he went crazy trying to jump out the car.

My energy monitor made the quietest beep the other day. And he went straight into panic. It’s like he can’t hear us or recognise food. Just heavy panting, digging at the floor and destroying everything.

The slightest noise when we are out walking sends him into utter fright. Just now, I let him off the leash and within 5 seconds an aeroplane went overhead. I saw his body language change and managed to grab him, but if I didn’t he would have walked off at fast pace, disinterested in food with 0 recall. His recall is excellent when he’s not scared.

It’s getting worse and worse, I suspect because of his age. But he is ruining his own life. We can’t walk him anywhere. He’s such a strong dog and I get burns on my hands from the leash as he tries to pull me home after he’s heard a scary noise.

We can’t take him out where there might be people because peoples chatter upsets him.

We can’t drive him to his favourite place, the beach, anymore. When I’m working my parents love looking after him, and he loves them, but now I have to leave him home alone because he can’t get in the car.

I really don’t know what to do. He’s hindering his own life as well as ours. He howls and begs to go on a walk, and within 5 minutes we’re back home trying to calm him down.

438,dogs,"Hello r/dogs!

I am new here, because my boyfriend and I just adopted the most awesome little lady.

She is a miniature or toy poodle (not sure) and we have had her for almost a week now. The background details are a little shady, but from what we gather she was surrendered by a “breeder” in Texas once they were done breeding her (which is insane to me because she is only a year and a half old?). She was kept indoors 24/7 and does not seem like she has been trained at ALL. The poor thing has had two reinfections with Giardia, hookworm, and tapeworm but is now on the mend. She also had to endure transport from Texas up to a shelter in Massachusetts right after being spayed one month ago. It seems like she came from a puppy mill. I’m astounded by the things that she has had to go through in her short little life.

Overall, things are going well. Ironing out the details of potty training and working on the basics of learning her name and “no” before moving onto other behaviors.

But the humping. It’s not harmful because she weighs eight pounds but MAN is it annoying. The other day she climbed up my back like a little goblin while I was sitting on the couch eating and wrapped her front paws around my head and started going to town on the back of my neck. She frequently tries to grab me. She doesn’t do it to anyone else, and I am definitely the person that she likes sitting and cuddling with the most.

Other than provide gentle correction (I don’t want to scare her and I don’t understand the nature of this behavior) is there anything I can be doing? I’ve looked at some articles online but was hoping for some advice.

She’s a really good dog and we want to make sure she receives proper training so that she can have the best life possible, she deserves it.

439,dogs,"Hi all, I need help with my two dogs. 
We have a 10yr old Bichon x cavalier (Buster) and a 6yr old shitzu (Charlie) who we love dearly. We are having problems with Charlie. I’ll be honest and say that between me and my family we’ve been pretty slack animal owners. The most training they’ve ever had is to learn how to sit. We don’t crate train and they have free roam of the furniture including sleeping in the bed with us. This hasn’t been a major problem besides when having people over or taking them for a walk.
The shitzu has started to become more and more problematic. My main concern is that he has started attacking my other dog and us. It has only happen a couple of times and thankfully nobody has got hurt but I realise that it’s completely unacceptable and dangerous. It mostly happens when Buster is eating something Charlie will come over to investigate and then just snap and tries to attack him. Since this we have started we have made sure to keep them seperate when feeding high value treats (it never happens with their regular food). 
Buster has become somewhat afraid of Charlie now. He wont eat around him and wont sit on my lap if Charlie is already there. They don’t play together very often and when trying to play fetch with them Buster will always let Charlie have the ball out of fear. We also cannot restrain him without him becoming aggressive. This means we cannot groom him ourselves although he has no issues with aggression at the groomer. I need some tips to help stop this behaviour, we cannot afford a behaviourist or trainer but I think the issue can be solved by training them both. To help so far I’ve decided to 


- Start taking them for a daily walk.
- Give them more enrichment including more toys and puzzle feeders.
- Start basic training 

I’d appreciate any tips or information especially on;

Training two dogs at a time? I’ve struggled to train them in the past as we cannot put one away or take the other out as they will cry or bark.

How can we make Charlie more tolerant of handling? 

How can we even out dominance between both dogs? 

Charlie loves to sit outside alone but will bark at any little noise. I understand that this is normal is there anyway to desensitise him to these? 


Will any of these fix the problematic behaviours that Charlie is exhibiting? Thank you all so much for your help.",t2_tgfaqsdr,0,I’ve been a bad dog owner.

453,dogs,"Hey all, sorry for the long post but I’ve been searching for almost 2 years on how to help my senior French bulldog who just turned 10…

Background: during the pandemic I experienced health issues that forced me to be on bed rest three different times within an 8 month time period for over a week at a time. During these three separate instances, my fur baby wouldn’t leave my side. My husband and kids had to physically force my dog downstairs to eat, drink water, go to the bathroom, and walk bc my dog just wanted to be right next to me to comfort me and as sweet as that is, I now feel like my health issues triggered my dogs mental/physical/emotional health 😭

After my second 7+ days of being in bed sick, my dog started showing signs of anxiety; such as shaking, panting, bulging eyes, rapid heart rate, not wanting to leave my side, following me closely wherever I went, scratching my feet and legs for attention and needing to be on my lap or trying to climb up on me when I sat down.I chalked this up as anxiety maybe due to not getting enough exercise over the course of the week I was sick. The first time this behavior appeared in my dog was right around his 8th bday and right after I recovered from the first health issue. It began right before we all went to sleep for the evening and lasted a few hours until I was able to hug him and calm him down on my own.

Fast forward to after the third 7+ day period that I was on bed rest, it happened again at night for a few hours before he calmed down. This time I took him to the vet to ensure it wasn’t something more serious. His vet did blood wOrk and X-rays to rule out health issues and brought up doggy dementia or IVDD but quickly ruled those two out. His vet gave me trazadone to use if he experience’s these episodes again.

Fast forward to about a year later,duriNg Xmas time last year, my dogs anxiety comes back but this time it’s out of the blue and not due to me being si k. I’m perfectly fine and feeling great, and these anxiety episodes were getting SO MUCH worse, lasting days, and coming back every few months. 

Starting last Xmas, his anxiety episodes got so bad that the tradazone didn’t work anymore so I brought him to the ER because he was shaking uncontrollably and running to walls trying to dig or as if he’s trying to hide, or dig himself into a hole, or as if he’s trying to jump out of his own skin. He either tries to hide in corners and scratches the walls or he tries to climb up on top of everything like the couches, tries to climb up on to my shoulders and even on top my face, also will try to climb up on the toilet, or the trash can in tHe bathroom, and can hurt himself. It’s gotten so bad I had to bring him to the er. Because no medicine can calm him down and it looks like his little heart is going to explode and he can’t breathe bc he’s panting so hard. The ER vets have tried Valium, trazadone, and other medications but nothing works when he’s so worked up. The er vets had to give him tranquilizer to get him to calm down and go to sleep.

Because nothing vets sent me home with could calm him down, I took him to the er 4 times in the course of 6 weeks before they sent me home with acepromazine which only 1/4 of a pill knocks him out cold.

I’ve tried everything.

So about a year ago my wife and I wanted to get a dog. Although I also wanted it, she needed it for her mental health. 

We have both need noticing over the past month or so that he is kinda ignoring her and really gravitating to me. When we come home he runs past her to me even though I’m ignoring him and she is trying to give him love and attention. 

I share my food with him but she does not because she is on a strict diet. She probably plays with him and also cuddles him more. 

The thing is this is really bothering her. I want to do whatever I can to fix it because I want the dog to love her more.

Now this is my first time ever in my 24 years living in this Earth to have a dog at home. I am absolutely lost on how to you know, make the dog feel that this is a good home or whatnot.

The problem is, me and my sister are out almost everyday for college and the dog is assigned to our maid to be taken care of. I kinda wanted to know like how do you even handle having a dog in limited time? Like how often do you need to spend time with him and do you pet him a lot or stuff and walking outside too.

I am a complete NEWBIE about this and I just want to know how to be a better family to the dog (although I'm not the primary caretaker) it still sleeps outside my room. 

Like can I give the dog food randomly or how often do I give him water and such, any advice would be REALLY helpful.

457,dogs,"So, like the title. I go to the gym with my sister at 4AM in the mornings. Our dog is both of ours and once he knows that both of us are gone he starts to whine and bark for about 20 minutes then quiets down. I’m assuming because whenever we come back to the house, we never hear him barking. We have been doing some training with getting him comfortable being alone and staying quiet when we leave but I still feel super bad if I leave the house and he ends up waking up our roommate. By the way he sleeps in his crate all night until I take him out around 7AM. 
I have been thinking about giving him a high value licking treat that he loves but it seems so early for him to have one. I also think that after he has it he’ll end up more awake causing him to realize his owner is gone so he whines and barks. 

I am planning to get a camera in my room to be able to see his actions but how should I improve his routine. Should I give him a treat this early in the morning? My goal would be to have him continue to sleep while we are gone honestly. 

Summary: Both of our dogs owners leave the house at 4AM and he wakes up our roommate with barking and whining. Should I give him a treat before we leave the house? Should I take him on a walk? How should I improve his routine that allows to leave him for an hour in the early morning?

470,dogs,"I got a rescue last April. It's a small size mix. He is so gentle and affectionate and he never used to bite. As far as I know, he spent his previous life on a chain but came to me looking cheerful, sociable and cuddly.

We have a cottage garden and a flat. He spent entire summer in the garden yard and he came into the flat for autumn/winter. 

At first, he began barking at everyone passing by our garden. It was excessive but I considered it normal. He was nice and quiet in the flat. But recently, he began barking in the flat as well, when our neighbours are in the common hall.

He was always super chill and playful with other dogs. A few weeks ago I began noticing he barks aggressively at certain other dogs on the walk (not all of them, only some. But before he didn't bark at all).

But what shocked and what I find absolutely unacceptable is that he was running freely in a safe outdoor area last weekend and without any reason whatsoever, he ran towards a stranger and began biting/pulling his sleeve and trousers until we physically stopped him!!! He's never done anything like that before and I'm getting concerned.


We're a quiet household, only me, dad and a cat. No one harms him in any way, we don't yell at him, we don't punish him in any way that could cause his aggression. He gets 3 walks a day.


Is he only now beginning to show his real personality? Is he gaining confidence as a ""guard dog""?

Is he frustrated that he's indoors for the autumn/winter and missing being in the yard all day?

I don't want this to escalate, what should I do?

Except for these occasions he's a sweetheart, extremely friendly and cuddly. He can play nicely with other dogs, never harmed anyone.

Get your dog’s glands to express completely and completely. The gland is a small organ located in the neck of the dog, just below the jaw. The glands produce and secrete a fluid into the body that is vital for the dog’s well-being. The glands are a secretory gland.

## can food cause anal gland issues in dogs

A poor diet can result in more anal gland problems, especially high carb kibble and low fibre canned meat. Many veterinary professionals recommend a high-fiber diet to help prevent this problem in [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) who are prone to trouble with their anal glands.

**treat:**

Adding prebiotics and probiotics formulated for pets, as well as a raw meat diet or bone twice a week can really help keep anal glands functioning properly.

Body secretions are the natural way of eliminating unwanted substances from the body. Many animals have glands that help them regulate their body temperature and keep themselves clean. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) have many ways of expressing glands, including saliva, tears and perspiration. They also have a large number of skin layers to help them stay clean. When a dog needs to release fluids, it uses a variety of methods to do so. Understanding how [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) express their glands can help them stay hydrated and healthy.

Dog’s fluidity is mainly regulated by their sweat and saliva glands. They have many sweat glands under their skin that produce excess moisture in the body. They also have moist membranes that separate their skin layers. This allows them to produce tears, which are liquid forms of the fluids in their eyes and nose. They also have numerous ear, eye and nasal secretions that help them stay clean and comfortable. In addition, they have a jugular laceration to help them get rid of excess fluids from their necks. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) need to release excesses of their body’s fluids through their various glandular systems.

When a dog needs to release excesses of its bodily fluids, it uses a variety of methods. They express saliva by biting its lips; they also exude tears by rubbing its eyes or nose with its hands or paws. They also tend to perspire profusely when they’re healthy, so they tend to cool themselves down. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) that live in hot climates typically need to stay hydrated to stay comfortable. They drink water but may also drink other liquids such as soda or fruit juice. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) may also chew ice or apply pressure to their jugulars for relief from excessive fluid buildup. Generally speaking, there are many natural remedies for when a dog releases excesses of its secretions.

Food is another way for [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) to release excesses of fluids from their bodies. Many owners know that their [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) are healthy when they eat well-balanced diets. Salty food helps with water balance in the body by promoting perspiration and encouraging the secretion of saliva and tears. Minerals in food also help regulate the body’s mineral salts, which promote further secretion of bodily fluids through the digestive tract and skin layers. Additionally, certain types of protein in meat promote further secretion through the adrenal glands- the part of the brain that promotes nervous system excitability in [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/). There are many food items that help the body release excesses of its fluids; learning these food secrets can make an owner more knowledgeable when caring for his [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/).

Body secretions are one way animals express different parts of their natural way of staying clean and comfortable with different substances in their bodies. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) use natural remedies such as chewing ice and applying pressure to their jugulars when stressed to help with excessive fluid accumulation in the body.

## Can Food Cause Anal Gland Issues in Dogs

An anal gland is a body organ found in both humans and animals. These glands are located near the anus and are used to release excreta. The main function of the anal gland is to clean the inside of the body. Humans, [dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) and other mammals have anal glands under their bodies, which release different types of secretions. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) have several types of anal glands, and their size differs depending on the type. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) with large anal sacs tend to have more frequent bowel movements. [Dogs](https://petscatsdogs.com/the-5-fastest-dog-breeds/) with small anal sacs tend to have constipation or diarrhea.

Anal glands are present in all mammals and can release a lot of liquid. These glands are usually soft and squishy and can be felt along the human anus. Some animals, including cats and rabbits, don’t have an anal gland system at all. Instead, they have a redundant system of retroperitoneal and perianal pads beneath their skin. These replace anal glands when they don’t function properly. Many mammals don’t have an anal gland system; however, that doesn’t mean they aren’t clean animals. They just don’t need to remove waste products from foods consumed.

475,dogs,"Hello All!

I understand that this may be a common topic, but I have searched a bit and did not find this direct topic mentioned or addressed.

You might guess this, but I'm thinking of getting my dog shoes. I've done research, and have a reasonable set picked out on amazon with a good cadre of reviews proving that the seller is legitimate and the product is not garbage.

My dog, a middle-aged mini (30lb) goldendoodle, is pretty okay with having his paws touched and handled, so I'm pretty confident that he could adapt to shoes, especially if it means getting him out when the roads are covered in ice-melt (no sidewalks, Mag Chloride and possibly other stuff used by plows) or sun-surface hot. Additionally I have always wanted to take him on deeper hikes in the nearby hills, some of it on really rocky terrain and likely snow/icey at many times of year.

My question is: if not shoes, what other dog foot protection options out there have people used and found a good fit for their critters?

There's balms, people talk about vaseline, there's different kinds of shoes - what works the best, in general and for you?

476,dogs,"About 5 days ago, I was bit my family dog. He is a small Bichon and is 17 years old. He is mostly blind from cataracts, and his health was serious decline and my family decided we were gonna put him down this week. However, while feeding him from my palm, he accidentally bit my skin (showing no sign of aggression, I think he was just confused since he cannot see well) and I drew blood. The last time the dog got shots was late 2019, so a little over 3 years. The vet said that we should wait 10 days and observe him to see if he shows signs of rabies. However, his condition is rapidly declining and he barely eats anymore is practically starving himself. 

I’m not sure what me and my family should do, as if we don’t wait the full 10 days can we guarantee he was not showing rabies? He only leaves the house to go on walks on a lease, and practically never interacts with other dogs. If we wait the full 10 days, he will continue to suffer, and I worry he may not even make it that long. 

Also, should I get a rabies shot? The vet told me I didn’t need one, but I’m nervous since rabies is 100% fatal.

478,dogs,"The puppy experience was one of the most difficult times of my life.  I bought a doberman puppy who was apparently sick(breeder lied and said it wasn't eating because it was adjusting from the mom's milk to regular food). Had it for a month and it's health declined.  Puking, diarrhea, constant urination, nipping, and the strong meds were not working.  After some time and extreme sleep deprivation I decided to give the done to a doberman shelter.  Found a foster mom who lost her dog and she was happy to take on our puppy.

Anyways long story short I'm still heartbroken that I couldn't muscle through my puppy's rough time.  The foster mom was able to get it healthy and found him a new home.

I just feel that it's time for another dog which I'm now adopting versus buying from a breeder.I constantly think of why I couldn't just keep with it but then remember how not sleeping for a month almost killed me.


So now I'm not buying a dog from any breeder but want to adopt. Also not getting a large more difficult breed such as a doberman.

I work from home and am home all the time.  I have 4 kids youngest is 4. 

Any recommendations for us?  Looking at adopting a young dog maybe about a year old.

How about a miniature pinscher?  Or Chihuahua Jack Terrier mix?   Are these difficult?

My boyfriend doesn’t really watch the dogs as closely as I do, since I have severe anxiety, and gave my dog two toys I know had squeakers in them, now I can’t find either. He has no toys that have squeakers because I know he eats everything, but my boyfriend didn’t know and thought it’d be nice to give him 2 soft plushies to go with his firehose and other relatively indestructible toys. I guess he just thought I was a mean mom. 

We had a storm today while I was at work, and I know my dog had two large, loose poops because they were on my rug in my house (he always poops/pees out of anxiety during bad storms if he’s alone). I noticed afterwards he did have nasty loose diarrhea, and I was taking him out every hour in case he has to poop. He did not poop normally, but was farting and dribbling diarrhea, and I know he had 2 huge horse poops within the last 5 hours, so that wasn’t as concerning to me. 

He’s also just finished fully switching foods after a 10 day process of weaning him into it, so poops right now are a little crazy to begin with. 

I am so scared. He’s acting normal, but a little gassy and didn’t eat all of his dinner like he normally does.

She has a black, wiry coat, and over the last couple of weeks, she’s been developing some doggy dandruff. besides giving her a bath, I will also wipe the dandruff with a wet paper towel or baby wipes if I see it. the dandruff is usually on her back area near her tail or hind legs. I discovered recently that the dandruff is almost clumping together as if it’s a like a scab or something.  these spots are very small but I have plucked like a half of dozen dry flakes off of her.  


does anyone now what might be going on with my dog’s skin and dandruff? I use doggy shampoo with like oatmeal in it for her baths like once a month.

485,dogs,"Hi, can someone help me to choose a breed? I'll try to make it short. 

About me:

I'm living in small flat with 2 rooms and kitchen. Have a great park nearby with lots of dogs. Will be first time dog owner, had only cats and parrots before. I work at home and have enough time to walk 2 times in a day. Ready to pay for cynologist (they're working close to my home). I would love to train the dog and don't mind spending lots of time on it. I was preparing to get a dog for 2 years after my cat passed away after living with me 15 years, so it's not 1 day desicion.

What I'm looking: 

Medium size breed. Someone like beagle. I don't want a small dog because somehow it will remind me of a cat... For a big dog it's going to be hard for us and the dog, we have a narrow corridors and not much open spaces... Medium would be perfect. 

Not too stinky. I don't mind some smell, but I'd hate if my flat would reek, i take strong smells pretty bad for some reason. But maybe you get used to dogs smell? I dunno. I'd also prefer short haired based on looks. Tho I'm living in a cold city so it could be -20c in some winter days (-10 most of the time in winter). 

I want a dog that can be trained (tricks, behaviour) well and have affection towards owner, love cuddling etc. 

Not a mandatory, but if can do some guarding would be cool, since i love walking at night and it's not very safe. But i don't wanna aggressive and dangerous dog as well. Sometimes ppl around me could yell and I don't want to make it a death experience. This is least important point tho. 

I don't some mind barking, since my neighbours are loud themselves, and i hate them anyway :D And they actually have a dog as well. 

I've been trying to search some breeds by myself and thought basenji would be good for me. However ppl saying they're hell to train.

487,dogs,"A few months ago I paid for my dog to start seeing a behaviorist. I use the term “seeing” loosely, because I haven’t actually seen a behaviorist in months.

The way that the program works is, they send me a sheet of commands to teach my dog, and I teach them to him and film them. Fine. But they want me to use a service that requires a monthly subscription to upload videos above 240p quality. Fine. 

I do the do for a few weeks and…I don’t get any feedback. None whatsoever. I expected them to explain the commands or give a reason that he’s learning them beyond a vague “he’ll regulate his emotions if he does x y and z.” It’s like I’m uploading the videos into a void and they never come back. So I ask if I can get feedback. I get a few very shallow messages after each video. “Looks good,” then done. I have no idea if what I’m doing is working because I was instructed to keep my dog away from all triggering stimuli (strange people, strange dogs, visitors, etc.).

I email them directly. I question if this is all working or not. I am informed that I was to make an appointment to get on a video call to discuss. 

I don’t know that I want to keep doing this because there is no proof that it’s working at all. I know that sounds like a very petulant thing to say, but the previous *trainer* (NOT a behaviorist) I worked with seemed more concerned with making sure my dog was being redirected and calm than the actual behaviorists that I’m paying for now. I get that Covid has really put a damper on in-person events, but one of the things that I liked about our trainer was the fact that they told us, in person, step-by-step, what to do and how to do it and how to begin the next steps when a task is completed. When I’m staring at a wall of text, I’m not really reassured that anything I’m doing is worthwhile.

My dog is reactive. He’s done very well with all of the commands he’s been given and he is crate trained and muzzle trained. The problem is, he’s still extremely anxious around strangers and we’ve done no work on that trigger at all. It’s been months since I’ve sought out to remedy this and my dog turned a year old. 

I was recommended to the behaviorist by a veterinarian, and the behaviorist themself said that they rehabilitate dogs that were going to be put down, so I really thought that I would have no reason to worry about finding another trainer/behaviorist.

488,dogs,"Hi all, I’m at the final stage of my adoption process. If things go well, I can finally meet the dog and bring her home.

I previously had a dog before, but this is my first time to adopt a rescued dog. She is a small lady, and the rescue described her personality as gentle and sweet. She’s with her foster home for about 2-3 months, and she’s behaving well in her foster home. So I expect she’s not too much traumatized or terribly afraid of people. 

I already prepared the basic stuff like water/food bowls, a crate, a playpen, a leash and a harness, a pet bed, and I’m going to slowly switch the food after she’s all comfy with me. 

I was told the dog needs some time to adapt on her new environment. And the rescue said they will give more info about this if they choose me as a final adopter. 

My problem is I have a two story house, and I’m not sure if I can move her around from the first day. 

I will be the person in charge, so I assume that I have to be in the same area with her even if she’s in her crate to decompress. 

So the questions arise,
1. Do I need to allow her to free roam around the house on the first day? Or do I need to limit her area with the crate and the playpen? If I need to limit her area, how long I have to do that?

2. When she needs to decompress herself, should I be in the same area with her? Or she needs to be completely alone?

3. In “2 story house” situation, I do go up and down, but mostly I spend my daytime in the first floor, and I sleep in my room located in the second floor. I’m planning to put her crate in my room so that she doesn’t feel alone at night. Eventually, I hope she sleeps with me on my bed, or next to my bed. 
Is it okay if I move her from first floor to the second floor at night? Or does she need to be located in the same area for a first few weeks? (In that case, she will be alone at night)

Please bear with me, I’m trying to prepare myself, and I need valuable opinions and advices.

491,dogs,"My wife and I lost two aging dogs over the last few months, and my wife convinced me to try fostering a dog rather than eventually getting a new one.  I was very hesitant because we have a senior German Shepherd who is currently injured and in an e-collar, and the dog she wanted to foster was from a breed known for dog aggression.  In fact, my GSD and I already have several experiences with dog aggression from this breed.  Plus, we have four cats to think about, and our number one priority has to be the well-being of the animals we are already responsible for.  But I agreed to meet the dog, and after doing so, I pretty much had to agree to give her a chance.

She is incredibly well socialized and gentle.  She is well fed and exercised, was apparently found with a collar, and is well groomed.  She is not the best trained dog ever, but she definitely has been trained.  To make a long story short, someone has has invested a lot of time, energy, and love in this dog, but although she had a collar, she had no tags and no microchip.  After 48 hours, we still cannot find anything online about a missing dog matching her description within 50 miles of the area she was reportedly found in.

How does that happen?  Did the owners just drop dead, or am I maybe looking in the wrong places?  
 Are there any good sites/tools we can use to see listings of dogs reported lost?  I have come across several websites using Google, but the number of truly *recent* listings is so small in such a massive metro area that I have trouble believing they are truly useful.

The organization who placed her with us is also looking, but I feel compelled to try as well.

501,dogs,"Hello! On Saturday, I was given a 5 month old female German shepherd by one of my aunts friends who’s dogs had some babies.

When I met up with the owners to pick the dog up, she was freaking out and trying to get away and hide under a car. The guy assured me and eventually picked her up and put her in my car and the ride home was mostly uneventful despite the dog being freaked out. Getting her out of the car was difficult and she ended up biting my cousin pretty good in the calf, but we managed to get her inside. 

She seems to have calmed down a lot since the first day and eats and drinks well and her overall demeanor is a lot more lax, up until someone tries to interact with her. I don’t have much experience with dogs and I’m pretty intimidated, but I’ve tried to talk to her a bunch and give off a good vibe but she’s not coming around, all I get is growling and nipping anytime I or my family get near her. She’s claimed our kitchen table as her safe space and basically has been under it since, occasionally coming out to eat, sniff around, and use the bathroom.

I’m a bit frustrated but I understand that she was suddenly pulled from all she knew and is now in a foreign place with people she doesn’t know. I really want to know what the best course of action is to win her over and help her get used to her new life. Do I just leave her alone or do I try and initiate and show her I mean no harm?

507,dogs,"Hey there! I got a 1 year old Shetland Sheepdog (intact) from a farm about 7 months ago. The owner bought him to use for breeding, then ""changed her mind"" and sold him. She kept him outdoors 24/7 from the time he was 8 weeks old. So he went through all of his puppy fear stages outside roaming around with other dogs, and as a result, has a serious noise phobia. Especially with thunder, loud noises like a blender or vacuum cleaner, etc. I did not find out he had anxiety until after I bought him. I was told he was a bit shy and that was it. Upon meeting him, he seemed a little nervous around the cars on the road but that was about it. After bringing him home, I found out he has major anxiety and is not leash trained. He is also PETRIFIED of being outdoors. If I grab the leash, he will run and hide in a corner and shake. He will barely go outside long enough to use the bathroom. He only is comfortable being in our apartment. 

To make matters worse, we boarded him at a kennel for Christmas and he has returned with a fear of women. He has been avoiding me around the house and will only go near my boyfriend, when he was perfectly fine before. I'm going to assume they treated him pretty roughly and dragged him out of bushes when he was hiding, because the manager was sarcastic and seemed annoyed by his anxiety when I picked him up. He apparently hid under bushes and hid from all of the employees. I'm not really sure what to do with him. I cannot afford a trainer, and even if I could, he would be scared of them.

509,dogs,"**Introduction**

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* Yes. I (33F) grew up with family dogs that I helped care for/train, but my partner (37M) did not.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

* We'd like to go through a reputable breeder for the health/temperament clearances and mentorship that comes along with that route.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

* Easy-going companion. Gets along with people &amp; animals, especially our existing cats. Up for outdoor adventures, but also content to be cozy on the couch.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* Most dogs we know are gundog breeds and we like that they're friendly &amp; biddable. My parents currently have a Standard Poodle and we've fallen in love with their intelligence, versatility, and blend of elegance &amp; clownishness. No terriers due to concerns for our cats' safety. No brachycephalic breeds due to concerns for their own health.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

* Basic manners (think Canine Good Neighbour), reliable recall, how to swim, and maybe some silly tricks for fun. Just want a well-rounded, well-behaved pet.

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport or use your dog for a form of work? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* No experience or need for this, but I'd consider Agility, Obedience, Rally, and (if applicable) Working Certificate/Hunt Test if the dog seemed to enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* I work from home full-time and my partner works from home 2 days a week, so we'd be interacting in some form or another all day. We'll attend weekly training classes right off the bat.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

* Two 30min walks around the neighbourhood + a few sessions of fetch throughout the day. Weekends would add another 30-60min walk or 90-120min hike in decent weather. Wary of dog parks, but would use a longline in nearby fields and schedule playdates with friends'/relatives' dogs

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* Ok to brush near-daily. I help clip my parents' poodle every few weeks and would like to clip my own if we get one, but we could also afford regular groomer appointments if need be. A straight-coated breed would get seasonal trims by a pro, but we can handle baths and ears/teeth/nails.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

**10)	What size dog are you looking for?**

* Medium. Small enough to fit in a canoe, big enough to not get snatched up by an eagle. Ideal range would be 15-20in (38-50cm) and 20-50lb (9-22kg).

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* Minimal shedding. Play/alert barking is fine, but no yapping/howling. No slobber.

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Pretty important but not an absolute requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* As snuggly as possible without having separation anxiety.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

* Eager-to-please.

**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* Calmly and politely. Alerting us to strange circumstances would be nice but not necessary.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* No, our family gatherings always include multiple dogs.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

* Pestering (or being pestered by) our cats is our #1 deal-breaker. They don't need to be BFFs and we anticipate and adjustment period, but they must peacefully coexist.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifestyle**

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

* A couple hours of errands a few days a week. We're homebodies but would make alone-time part of training in order to avoid issues on the occasional night out.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* N/A. No one else lives with us.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

* Yes, we have two adult cats.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* We have no children, but our friends &amp; relatives have kids that the dog would see fairly often.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* No, we own our home.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* Atlantic Canada. No breed restrictions.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Summer: 19°C (66°F), humidex can make it feel like mid 30s (95). Winter: -7°C (19°F), wind chill can make it feel like mid -20s (-13).

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information and Questions**

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

* We're primarily considering a Poodle since they seem like a great all-rounder breed, but want to know if there are any potential matches we haven't considered!

**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**

* We'd ideally get a dog around 2-5yrs old rather than a puppy. Do you have any tips on sourcing retired bitches or failed show prospects?

510,dogs,"  **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    As an adult, yes. Had some as a kid but it's been 20 years. 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    No preference, but I do find lots of rescues won't adopt to us because of our kid's ages. But I'm also not looking to spend thousands on a puppy when there are rescue puppies are out there.

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    Looking for a smaller/medium dog that doesn't need a lot of professional grooming and has enough energy to play with toys with the kids but doesn't need a ton of exercise outside of playing in the backyard and in the home and the occasional excursion. Patient, playful, loves to snuggle some times, but not the attached at the hip type.

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've always dreamed of adopting a retired greyhound, but supply is becoming more limited (although I do live a state over from 2/3 of the remaining race tracks) and not sure if their background would fit our family situation. Whippet would be awesome, but less common. I grew up with dachshunds and have fond memories of them. Nothing extra small. As much as I like bigger breeds like goldens, my kids are small and are sometimes intimidated by large breeds. As we go exploring shelters, I wouldn't be upset if they fell in love with a gentle giant breed.

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just standard obedience

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No sports

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-2 hours of direct interaction, but dog will very seldom be home alone and its a full house, so potentional for all day long interactions

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

1-2 hours of outside play time in our decent sized backyard, maybe 1-2 outdoor excursions like nature walks a week. We aren't very big on taking long walks in the neighborhood, so we honestly won't go on daily long walks.

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

 Can definitely do basic grooming at home, but would not want a dog that needs more professional haircuts than I do.

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    Small-medium because my kids are still young and small

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

  Small amounts. Had a husky for a short time in college in AZ (very bad decision on my part, rescue should not have approved it) and it was too much.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

  Not important, I will keep it leashed in public

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

 A mix, me and the kids would love snuggles but sometimes I don't want a dog on top of me.

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  


With interest and happiness, but not freaking out barking and struggling to get out the door

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

 I don't want any aggressions

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 No aggressions of any kind, not protective of food or toys

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

  Rarely, I'm a stay at home mom with young kids, husband works from home, so at most, it'd be a couple hours a week when the whole family goes to church or out to dinner.

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

 Husband is OK with a dog, but doesn't want to be that involved much in caretaking.

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

 No other pets

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

 Yes, we have a 6yo, 4yo, and 1.5yo. They are kids, so they are active and run and jump around, but they aren't super high energy, raucous kids and in all their dog interactions so far, they have been gentle petters and players. The middle child was nervous around a relative's 30 lb border collie mix who was doing zoomies, but it was her first time spending so much time with a dog.


    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

  Own

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 Virginia, US, no laws I'm aware of

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

  Summer: 61-86° and muggy
Winter: 19-42° 

    **Additional Information and Questions**

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

512,dogs,"Alright I hope nobody takes this the wrong way. So I’ve had cats all my life- I absolutely adore them. One of my passions in life is learning about cat behavior, nutrition and care. My cat passed recently and I’m with a partner that is allergic to cats and loves dogs. I like dogs and spend a lot of time learning about them as well, but I have sensory sensitivities and some dogs can be too much for me. Their excitable energy, barking, licking or clinginess can stress me out if it’s excessive. We might get a dog some day in the future, and I’m just curious about what breeds are similar to cats as far as being more laid back and not as intense as some dogs sensory wise.

I know a lot of it has to do with proper training but I also know breeds have some natural differences. Just as a disclaimer, I’m not expecting the dog to act like a cat or replace a cat. I’m not expecting them to never do what I listed because it’s natural to them, I would never force them to stop or take it out on them. I know they’ll naturally need more exercise and have different needs, I care about dogs a lot and will do everything in my power to care for them properly and make them feel loved.

522,dogs,"
We have a terrier mix about 1-2 years old. He is a friendly, playful dog and great with our three kids including our rough toddler who loves him the most. But shortly after we brought him home, he developed an obsession for taste and smell to such a point where it takes over his behavior literally from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed. 

I’m going to try and insert some levity in the below examples of his behavior, but the truth is it’s driven me to my wit’s end. 
- Constantly sniffing and licking the floors, baseboards (our house is kept very clean). Chews baseboards and corners of walls. 
- Eats dustballs behind furniture. Actively seeks them out by squeezing behind dressers and under beds to find and eat dustballs. 
- When we’re eating at the table, he will either sit under the table or under the chairs waiting to food to be dropped. Or he’ll wait nearby, poking his head around the corner and crouching like a lioness in the tall grass about to take its prey, waiting for us to leave the table so he can immediately run over and huff/lick the rug for whatever microscopic bits he thinks are there. 
- Takes food from my toddlers hands. On a few occasions has jumped up to try to grab food out of my toddler’s mouth. And by food I mean plain Cheerios. When I separate them, the dog whines and whimpers because he wants the cheerios. And when the cheerios are all gone? He spends the next hour huffing the floors for that cheerio dust. 
- My children have lost interest in him because he all he does is sniff and lick them. When they get home from school, he licks the back of their legs and their feet for the salt (I guess?)
- More importantly, they can’t even pet him because he won’t stop licking their hands, fingers, and face. Initially, we thought he was giving kisses, but we realized he was just interested in figuring out what they had for lunch/snack time. 
- When not doing the above, and the kids are playing on the floor, he will sit butt-up against them, or in between then and whatever they’re doing, showing a little bit of dominant behavior. But again, if they try to pet him he’s really just interested in smelling/tasting their skin. 
- When I’m trying to prepare and cook food in the kitchen? He’s right there, standing behind you. Waiting for something to drop. If I move to another counter, he darts over to where I was standing and licks the floor, hoping to catch a fallen bit. Otherwise, he will stand in or just outside of the kitchen and stare at you, while licking the surrounding area.

I can’t overemphasize that he exhibits behavior like the above all day, every day. Its become unbearable and is starting to ruin our relationship with him.

I’ve tried crate training, but as soon as I let him out he runs into the dining room and living room and commences his sniff/lick search. It (his behavior) doesn’t end until he goes to sleep. And we don’t hand him food, so this isn’t a learned behavior.

If anyone has any advice, similar experiences, please share. As he is our family dog, I’m hoping that as long as we keep discouraging/disciplining bad behavior he will eventually outgrow this phase. But I’m afraid that this is what we get, for the rest of his life.

I brought her home and fed her hoping she would eat more than she has been and she ate even less than she did yesterday. I really don’t know what the best approach is—like is this something where we just ride the wave or do we need to schedule an appointment with the vet? She doesn’t act like she’s uncomfortable she has been napping more and is still excited to go on her walks and play outside. But she gets pretty whiny when my boyfriend is in the garage and she can’t be close to him and this never used to be an issue.

534,dogs,"Hi all, today I took my young terrier to a local dog park for the first time. I've spent the good part of the year socializing her on leash at dog friendly shopping areas, local universities, and parks. Her recall is also excellent now. She is friendly with fellow small dogs so I took her to the under 30 lbs play area. 

As soon as we arrived, I unleashed her in the fenced entryway and as soon as I opened the fence to the main area, we were rushed for a few young children. I didn't see them at first because the play area is sloped so there is a Blindspot from the entryway. I had to leash her up soon after as there were many (unsupervised? Semi-supervised?) Kids running around with the dogs, screaming and generally having a good time. The parents were off to the side socializing and perhaps, checking in briefly from time to time. I was wondering if it is normal for parents to bring young children to a dog park as they run around touching dogs like it's some kind of petting zoo? It seems the parents were there mainly for human socializing reasons and didn't want to attend closely to either dog or child. 

My second question is is it necessary for my dog to be 100% nonreactive under 100% of conditions to come to the dog park. She is fine in crowded places, even airports, but she will growl when strangers including kids suddenly try to pet her without warning. She was so good today, even though these kids were out of control, she ignored them and listened to me as I leashed her back up. I simply couldn't take the chance that one kid would touch her the wrong way. She is also the ""cute type"" so I'm always on the look out for wayward kids.

543,dogs,"Long time lurker but first time posted in here. I've dealt with dogs all my life, having my own for the past 10 years before he passed last February and also working as a dog sitter on again off again as a side hustle thru university. My partner's parent adopted a dog last spring and me, trying to be a kind future son in law with dog handling experience as well as looking forward to bond with the fur baby after mourning my own pet loss, happily said yes when they asked I'd be willing to watch him while they went away for a weekend trip. I've since done this several times over the past few months, sometimes a simple overnight and other times (like right now) for over a week. In general, the dog is utterly adorable and I love him, but there's one thing that gets under my skin.

It's not that he's ""not"" housebroken per se, but rather his owner (my future in law) has inadvertently trained him to exclusively go inside. I'll take the dog out several times a day for over an hour, I've tried long walks, leash free fields, random woods, you name it. The dog will literally hold in his business until the moment we walk back thru the door. I've kept the dog outside for up to 3 hours sometimes just trying to get him to go and he will still be crying and whimpering while holding it in, begging to go back inside. I know my in law said that potty training was a rough go at first and that the dog loved using every corner of the house, but that now he's settled on the bathroom tile and a specific patch of carpet in bedroom as his go to spots.

I've tried giving advice without coming across too bitchy but the owner just seems uninterested and has openly stated that sometimes it's easier to just deal with the cleanup then leash him up for a walk. My partner is not a dog person at all and has told me that if it's really irking me I have every right to just say no to his parent when he asks me to watch the dog. I really do love this animal and enjoy my relationship with my future in law, but this is such an irritating and confusing situation. The dog just seems adverse to going in nature and would much rather hold it in and let loose when we're inside at home. I don't have the time to take out of my own life to spend every day as a trainer for the dog, and I've never encountered this problem before in any other pet I've watched or owned.

548,dogs,"I adopted a pup out of rescue 6 weeks ago. He just turned 6 months old and is now at 32 lbs. He was well socialized but not introduced to many things he should have been, among them leashes and baths. I have a trainer I work with and we have the harness-leash-training things covered, but baths are proving to be insanely hard. He's had 2.

I don't know if this pup was beaten during a bath, bathed with a cold hose in the snow, or if he has some other reason for being terrified of the process, but he is. I live in the country and I have a lot of sandy soil. We got some snow overnight that quickly melted and turned into a fine place for rolling around and getting coated with muddy, sandy dirt. The necessary bath was his second and it's gotten harder as he's gotten bigger. I don't want to bathe him more than necessary, but I'd also like him to be able to get dirty from play and be ok with a bath. I have an older dog who gets filthy at times and she gives me dirty looks, but she is compliant.

I did try a lick mat with peanut butter. He's not even there yet. The rational part of his brain that wants peanut butter isn't engaged. He's wild-eyed, moaning, trembling like crazy, and gouging me as he tries to escape the tub. It takes one hand to keep him in the tub while I try to clean him up with only one hand, and I'm using my head to block his attempt to jump out.

He was at 3 cups a day plus occasionaly treats up until about a year ago when we dropped it to 2 cups a day.  His treats are generally lower calorie like meat, bell pepper, green beans but occasionally a little carrot or peanut butter as well.

Anyways at 7yo he has gained several pounds since his last checkup (I think he was 76lbs a year ago) and I think he is a tad overweight with a good amount of fat around the ribs imo.  And now he just tore his ccl ligament and his activity is more limited.  In addition in order to give him medications we've been using peanut butter or cheese (sidenote when I first noticed how much peanut butter she gave him with pills I was shocked, it was like two tbs, so I suggested we try to use as little as possible since we gotta do this twice a day).

I also slow cooked several pounds of venison and have it frozen in half pound portions so we can use that as well.  The venison is cooked with no oils and I am trying to encourage us to use that as much as possible in the pill giving and cut back to 1.5 cups of regular dog food.

555,dogs,"Our girl has stage 3 arthritis in her back and in the last 4 months we've gone from Carprofen as needed (maybe 1 or 2 every two weeks?) to daily Carprofen and Gabapentin as needed (about every other day to almost daily).

We are looking into further treatment options that do not involve going to the vet regularly for treatments (meaning more frequently than once or twice a month).

556,dogs,"So my 10 year old beagle mix, we think has arthritis. The vet didn’t do any x-rays, but we’re pretty sure that’s what is going on…. She doesn’t jump up on the couch quite as often but still does, and sometimes growls if we’re petting her shoulders and hips. One time she went to jump on the couch but whimpered and didn’t Jump up. She’s still playful and runs a lot on walks. But, she has a lot of other health problems (cancer, allergies, and pancreatitis) and is on several medications: Metacam for pain, cerenia for nausea, b12 shots for her skin allergies, ant-acid, and an anti-diarrheal only as needed. The vet prescribed gabapentin for the arthritis because she said it would be ok with the Metacam, but it’s a controlled substance so we can only get small amounts at one time, it’s expensive, and our vet is an hour away because we moved and didn’t want to change vets. The gabapentin can cause lethargy and diarrhea, and she’s already lazy and has diarrhea sometimes when the pancreatitis flares up, so I’m hesitant to give it to her. But, I don’t want to do nothing.

I then went to the window and started tapping on it to see if the dog would come over. He did end up coming over and it looks like a black lab. He started wagging his tail and he looked like an older dog. I opened the window so the screen was showing and he put his nose up to the screen. He seemed calm so we brought him so water through the garage. It’s like he knows us. He just keeps wagging his tail and he’s been laying on the front patio for the last 30 minutes.

I don't really know why I am posting, other than wondering if any owners of elderly bestest friends have dealt with this before and can offer thoughts.

565,dogs,"I need some advice, so please read all of this. 

So, I have a 6 year old terrier mix that was originally my GF moms dog for the first little over 5 years. 
Her mom was terrible to this dog. Would spank him with shoes if he didn’t listen, but never actually took time to try and help him learn anything. Would constantly feed him normal human foods like burgers, tacos, salads, birthday cake, spaghetti, etc. 

So obviously, he has pretty bad behavioral issues. 

He is very overly aggressive, will try to bite strangers and other dogs when I walk him, has bitten me multiple times. Gets very protective of his treats/bones (I know animals are generally protective of food, but I’ve had pits, been around my grandmas Rottweiler and they all were never this protective to the point of trying to cause physical harm to anybody who even just walks by them) 

Also has bad separation anxiety, he will bark from the second we leave the door to the second we open that door to come home (we live in an apartment, so that probably doesn’t make the neighbors happy). 

He really is overly aggressive and my girlfriend has a 7 year old that’s my biggest concern. I don’t trust this dog around kids or really anybody just because of how he is. 

Now, I don’t know what to do about him. 
We can’t give him to anybody else or put him in a shelter because of how aggressive he is. 

I don’t want to have to put him down, but I don’t see us managing to keep him for a couple more years. 
It sucks because he has moments where he is very affectionate and nice and loves to play and cuddle, but because of how he was raised he just doesn’t understand how to act and I don’t blame him one bit. I blame my GF mother and it makes me frustrated with her every time he acts up because I know that if he was raised right and actually cared for he could’ve very easily been a very nice and well behaved dog. I just feel like it isn’t fair to give him away or put him down because he wasn’t really give the chance to be the best version of himself. 

But again, I don’t see us keeping him for too much longer just because of the physical damage he can cause to people and has caused already, as well as his constant barking that annoys the neighbors and him pooping and peeing in the house so frequently.

566,dogs,"So I am a new first time pet owner. I work from home. I adopted a Yorkie and Shih Tzu (Shorkie) in May (born in March). Apparently I did not crate train him properly bc whenever he is in isolation at the vet or daycare, I get notified that he is crying and barking to the max. This is not the case at home as throughout the day I allow him to roam and only crate him at night. However, it seems as though that is not enough time in the crate. 

In addition to that, my dog has a hard time maintaining his composure when I have company. If I isolate him in the laundry closet, even with music on, he loses his shit.  If I close my door for more… intimate encounters, he barks and whines as well. You would think he is getting stabbed or something. It’s to a point where I feel weird about having company. When it’s just us, he is well behaved and quiet. He doesn’t even bark at random things which both Shih Tzus and Yorkies are notorious for. 

A friend of mine suggested moving his cage into isolation which is the laundry closet itself. By crate training him there, it will keep him in a relaxed state when company comes since he would be used to being in there. Plus he wont be able to physically see and hopefully not smell them from there. Out of sight, out of mind. 

However, it’s been abit of a nightmare. He is going crazy. I’ve tried trazodone and even acepromazine, but nothing seems to work on him. Ive also tried these things in the past with company here and he is still super active and jumping on them. I’ve tried the thundershirt and calming spray as well, still no use. He is a 13lb puppy, I can’t imagine why none of these things would work. Sometimes I question if the vet is giving me placebos. I just need something to calm him down.",t2_e3t128dh,0,My dog won’t calm down (Help),"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,101jncl,True,lurakona,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/101jncl/my_dog_wont_calm_down_help/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/101jncl/my_dog_wont_calm_down_help/,2477929,1672683982,0,,False,1672683996,1672683996,2023-01-02 18:26:22,,,,,,

568,dogs,"For about 2 years now, I've had 2 dogs. One is a purebred GSD we got from a breeder, the other is a 4 yr old Pitbull Mix. The GSD has always been a very good player when it comes to other dogs, and though temperamental My pitmix is too. Recently, about 4months ago we started looking at dogs. We found 2 we liked (both shelter dogs, around 1 &amp; 3) and the 3 yr old was the one we picked. They told us she was dog reactive, so they had us bring both of our dogs in to check. They did good, but the moment we brought her home she started growling at our dogs and snapping at them when we got to close. My grandmother, who was the owner of this new dog fell in love with her (I'll admit I did too, but she was under heartworm quarantine thing so she didn't come out much) and didn't want to get rid of her. When she got out, It started to cause many problems with our other dogs. She would growl at them when they even touched me or my mother, and My pitmix started to snap at them. 2 Bad dogfights happened, but our shelter told us to keep her until she ran out of her meds. Both dogfights resulting in 3 bites happening to me &amp; my mom. Both of my dog bites from her landed me in the hospital /w stitches. That's when we took her back. Getting her was a mistake, but these are our first ever dogs and first experience with a dog-reactive dog. Now that this dog is gone, I've noticed my Pit-Mix is more alert at other dogs and if we pet them she growls and lunges. She was my ESA, and often went to events with my Friend's service dog (dog friendly places) and now those events cannot happen. She was extremely well trained, and these are new behaviors. I don't know how to fix it, but she also keeps getting out of her collar/harness to get at cats too. Ive looked into training, but it's mostly boarding and costly. She would not do well at boarding, and I want to know if theres anything i can do to help her. I know, we made a grave mistake in getting the other dog, and We've learned our lesson. I'm fully expecting comments calling us out for this, but I love this dog. She's my everything. I can't imagine a world where she can't come to college with me, or stay in an apartment with me. I can't call her an ESA if she's growling at other dogs, it doesn't feel right to me. Any advice is something I'd be grateful for.

570,dogs," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, however, this will be my first dog owning/training on my own as an adult. I grew up with dogs and assisted in training one of our family’s dogs. I grew up with a Brittany Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and Lhasa Poo.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* My husband and I would prefer to rescue.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog is sweet, playful, gets along well with humans and other dogs, and doesn’t bark too much (we have a neighbor on the other side of the wall).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I would prefer a medium sized dog that I can manage on walks and not feel like the dog is the one walking me.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Sit, stay, lay down, go to their bed, and to walk well

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 4 hours

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. I am planning daily walks (potentially 2 walks, one in the morning and one in the evening). A dog park is something I could do twice a week. We also have a fenced in backyard where we can run and play.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to brush at least once a day. I am open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, and other grooming. I am also willing to pay a professional for regular grooming as needed.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium size

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I prefer minimal shedding, if possible but it’s not a dealbreaker for me. We have hard wood floors that are easy to clean. I would really prefer minimal barking since we live in a shotgun home with a very thin wall and I believe our neighbor often works from home. Slobber is also not a dealbreaker but less is preferred.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* In the middle, but closer to eager-to-please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* It’s important to me to have a friendly dog. I would prefer a dog that doesn’t intimidate people and visitors. I would prefer some sniffs and licks when greeting people and to stay on the ground without jumping up.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, I would really prefer a dog that’s friendly to other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* The main behaviors I want to avoid are loud, consistent barking and aggressiveness.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Mondays and Wednesdays for 8 hours, Tuesdays and Thursdays for 7 hours

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband prefers a medium sized dog that keeps barking to a minimum. He’ll assist in caring for the dog (e.g., feeding, letting outside, etc.).

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope!

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No. We have a two-year-old niece that we see occasionally and I would certainly want the dog to be friendly with her if they meet.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We are currently renting. We are looking to buy in the next few years. There are no breed or weight restrictions on our current lease.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in New Orleans, LA. I am not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In the winter, the average daily high temperature is 66°F. Summer daily high temperatures are around 91°F. We are considering moving to a much cooler climate in the next few years.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

I'm not fussed about getting a purebred dog, so how do I make sure that I get a dog from a reputable person?

579,dogs,"We (I'm 17 M, My dad is 47 M) own six acres of Texas land with one side of the property bordering a lake. We are surrounded by neighboring properties on all sides besides water and we have had multiple calls from each neighbor telling us that Augie (His name) is with them. A while back my dad decided to put fencing around our property because shock training wasn't working. I was really frustrated with that situation because we had to deforest a lot of our trees and now the fence just looks ugly on our property. 

Now that worked for months, but not long ago, Augie started noticing that if he sat and waited at one specific part of the fence, our neighbor would come out and praise him and give him treats. We knew about this and allowed it. As long as he stayed in the property, we're happy. But, Augie would go out of eye sight more and more often. It became a worrying problem when we would check his usual spot and he wasn't there. Turns out, he would be trailing around the fence. Finally, he learned that there was an end to the fence, all he had to do was go through some bushes and he'd be out. Long story short, we would get calls from neighbors daily that they would have him. 

My dad, after he let Augie out, watched him. Augie would do his business and immedietly, without second thought, go straight for the opening. And this is no easy hike. It's about 100m of trees and shrubbery to get there. But, we had had enoug, so be got some of the unused fencing in storage and connected it to a wall on the neighboring property, with the neighbors permission.

This did not stunt Augie's escapes.

Since then we've learned two things. One, being that Augie is swimming through the lake onto neighboring property. And two, being that Augie is leaping over the fence. Augie is not a big dog and we have a pretty high up fence, so I am astonished as to how he is doing this.

We've spent thousands of dollars trying to keep this dog inside the property and nothing is working. I am fed up with this shit. I've had to go out and look for Augie every time he gets out. I've had to be the one to put down new fencing, cutting and brusing my skin. And I've been the one that Augie now fears because I'm being pushed over my limit with this dog.

This morning we discussed new possibilities, including introducing the shock collar once more, increasing the height of almost a kilometer of fencing, or buying a $600 gps signaled shock collar. I've always suggested lessons done by either us or a trainer, but my dad always subjects to something else. It's almost as if the trainer would be a last case scenario with him, and I have no idea why he's so against it.

At this point we're desperate because if nothing else works, the best option for us, mentally and financially, would either be to keep an outside dog indoors for most of his life or just get rid of him.",t2_4ctq1jmo,0,Our 3 year old brown lab won't stay in our propperty if the world depended on it.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,101hxp3,True,J3lloFish,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/101hxp3/our_3_year_old_brown_lab_wont_stay_in_our/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/101hxp3/our_3_year_old_brown_lab_wont_stay_in_our/,2477911,1672679917,0,,False,1672679932,1672679933,2023-01-02 17:18:37,,,,,,

581,dogs,"I really really need advice on how to handle this dog, especially on how to take him on walks more safely! sorry in advance for the long post, **you can just respond to the TL:DR, the rest is context and specifics &lt;3**  
**TL:DR: Dog jumps and bites me constantly when walking or playing, how do I make him stop? I'm really short, he always managed to bite my arms and now I'm covered in bruises.**  


I'm currently house-sitting my bf's mums house whilst they're away, they've been gone 4 days and will be back home in 8 days from now. They have a **1-year-old golden retriever** that I'm really struggling with, specifically when it comes to playing or going for walks.

&amp;#x200B;

Some specifics:  
\- He lives in a house of 10 people, half of these people are kids under the age of 15. He has constant stimuli with them playing with him, interacting with him or just being noisy. Compared to the quiet remote-working me and my boyfriend, I think he's a bit bored.  
\- The dog is not trained beyond ""sit"" and ""paw"", no recall training and doesn't respond to ""no"" most of the time.  
\- When we first started house-sitting, he shat and peed in the house freely without whining at the door. He's stopped this now as we got a good routine of going for walks.  
\- Also when I first got here, he would constantly jump on me and bite my arm. I think it's roughhousing as he doesn't snarl or expose his teeth in any way and my own golden retriever used to do this when he was very young but he was taught to stop before he was anywhere near this dogs age, same with my previous dog.   
\- Not neutered, pretty sure he was trying to hump me whilst nipping my leg too, got lots of small bruises and scratches from it.  
\- I'm in the USA, not sure if this is relevant but attitudes here regarding dogs seem different than back at home in the UK.  
\- There is a yard, but there is no fence and there's a main road too. He WILL bolt for the road if he's loose at any point. We set up this makeshift system of multiple extending leashes tied together and then secured to a post in the far back of the garden. So one strong leash was attached to him, and then attached to that were the two extending leashes, just incase one failed.. but he's never pulled on it too hard since it extends pretty darn far. Always supervised when I did this, I sit outside and work on my laptop the whole time so we'd only sit outside for a couple hours or so.  


When I walk him:

\- I make sure he can stop as much as he wants to sniff, pee, poop and investigate things that intrigue him.   
\- He has a main 1 hour long walk and then multiple shorter walks, as there is no yard to put him into safety just so he can pee.  
\- I've been bringing a bag of treats to try and reinforce positive behaviour, but it seems to have done nothing and he doesn't react to the bag of treats at all.  
\- He refuses to pee in the yard anyway, pretty sure the family drag him back home the moment he pees so he's learnt to hold it in when on a walk for as long as possible.  
\- When we do walk back home, we try to make it into a loop so he doesn't realise he's going home. But when he realises what's happening, he jumps and BITES my arm. Not lunging and aggression, maybe just trying to play to extend the walk? but he's a big dog and I have bruises covering up both my arms now. And it's incessant.  
\- He wont stop if I say no, I tried the whole ignoring and turning my back thing but he wont stop no matter how long I do it for and it fucking hurts. My boyfriend refuses to let me walk him by myself after I came back crying. We've had to hold him down when it got so bad which is seemingly multiple times per walk, I do not want to be doing this. We also basically have to carry him into the house at the end of walks to avoid the biting.  
\- He has a normal collar and a choke collar. I hate choke collars... but he yanks himself out of his main collar the moment he realises he's going home, or at least yanks so hard I nearly go flying. I've had to attach both collars when we start walking home for when he starts acting up just so I have any form of control.   
\- I've been teaching him to walk by my side rather than pulling, he's actually responding to this really well! I'm pleasantly shocked as he was basically dislocating my shoulder before, but it does go out the window when we start walking home.   


When I try to play with him:  
\- He hoards toys, specifically the balls I was trying to kick around the yard with him. If I take it from him, he'll do the whole jumping and biting thing. If he gets too excited from play, more jumping and biting. If I don't play enough, more jumping and biting. If I ignore him, even more biting. Any status other than ""relaxed"" escalates into biting.

584,dogs,"We have a large fenced-in yard. And I have a large American bulldog. We have a couple in our neighborhood that has a shitzu. The husband regularly walks his shitzu up to our fence and lets him bark aggressively at my dog. He stands there and talks to his dog. This seems to rile his dog up more. His dog barks and grows constantly, my barks, but it's not aggressive. He seems to think it's playtime. The barking is annoying for me, and I'm sure the rest of our neighbors as well. I always call my dog inside because this situation really irritates me. Part of why it's so annoying is because of a previous situation that happened with this dog. Over the summer, I was in my front yard while we were having a garage sale, and the female owner of the shitzu was walking him off leash. I hadn't acknowledged or interacted with the dog, but its owner was looking at stuff we had out. While she was looking, he was running around the yard, then bit me. She profusely apologized and immediately leashed him. We talked about how he is while they're walking. She said she knew he's reactive towards my dog and agreed to walk him on the other side of the street. I haven't seen her walk him without the leash since that incident. However, the husband still allows his dog to taunt mine aggressively. I always step outside and grab my dog when this starts.

My 1 year old Husky GSD mix has been on trifexis for about 9 months now. Every month when he takes it, he is always unable to control his bladder the next day. He is bell trained and will ring them when he needs to go out, but after taking trifexis will start randomly urinating sometime the next day. I know he isn't doing it on purpose because it happens while he's walking and he'll stop and just look at us with his ears down. The only other symptom he has is a little lack of appetite.

591,dogs,"I’ve been wanting a puppy ever since I was 10, as soon as i found out i could get one i instantly started researching between the 2 breeds i wanted, Border collie or german shepherd. July 25th I found adorable german shepherd puppies and fell in love with one of them instantly. I wasn’t planning on getting a puppy that month because we were moving but my dad also really loved the dogs and decided to contact the owner. We facetimed and i got to pick the puppy i wanted. I got the pup july 27th. It was great at first, but then things started going downhill. I take care of the puppy, I train the puppy, I researched for 2-3 years on this dog. My dad has done none of that and he thinks he knows more than me. At the time i got my puppy i didn’t know the difference between WB dogs and BYB dogs, turns out my gsd is BYB. I started taking her out a couple days after i got her, she was 9 weeks. I did everything i could to socialize her, desensitize her, whatever i could to get the best dog possible. But even at 9 weeks, she started developing reactivity. Now we’ve made a lot of progress with her reactivity but my dad is being very frustrating about it. Her reactivity is fear based, she has never shown any signs of aggression at all, but she’s literally terrified of dogs. She will bark, scream, and yelp whenever a dog gets near her. my dad doesn’t think this is a big deal and that she’ll just grow out of it which is really infuriating. I’ve worked with her for months all by myself because he refuses to get a trainer and it’s so draining training a reactive dog as a 13year old girl who just wants to enjoy her dog. that’s not the only thing he does but this is the main big issue. my puppy is 7 months now. she doesn’t usually bark at dogs anymore but she has her off days",t2_clfbznsu,0,My dad is so frustrating with my puppy,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,101fz8h,True,blushable_,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/101fz8h/my_dad_is_so_frustrating_with_my_puppy/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/101fz8h/my_dad_is_so_frustrating_with_my_puppy/,2477882,1672675083,0,,False,1672675100,1672675100,2023-01-02 15:58:03,,,,,,

593,dogs,"TLDR: Current dog is not playing appropriately with new dog. Both dogs are adults and seem to get along well otherwise, but play becomes too rough and current dog doesn’t listen to social cues. 
 
My 7 yo female dachshund mix (Minnie) came to us as a rescue from a hoarding situation where I don’t think she learned the best social skills related to play. We just adopted a 5 yo male dachshund mix (Toby) who is very well-mannered. Minnie has been initiating play with him frequently. When he is not interested, she doesn’t listen and keeps trying to nibble at his neck, bark in his face, etc. When he is interested, the play doesn’t typically last long because we have to interrupt due to Minnie biting his neck excessively or her getting overstimulated. Toby has not corrected her, but he will move away when we separate them, which I believe indicates he wanted the play to stop.

Toby only been with us for less than a week, so I’m hoping some of Minnie’s behavior is excitement from having a second dog in the home. Aside from the play issues, they sleep near each other, go on walks together, hang out in the backyard together, etc. She’s had no issues with food or sharing attention either. In every other aspect, things seem to be going well. 

So is it possible for dogs to improve their play behavior as adults? Are we handling this correctly by just separating them when play becomes inappropriate, or is there something else we should be doing? How long is this likely to last?

598,dogs,"So my pup had her spay botched four months ago, which led to extensive surgery that cost me a total about 10k out of pocket. I was happy to save her and to have had the means to take care of her. They had to take out a large portion of her intestines, which means she’s basically stuck having diarrhea for life even with medicine and prescription food. Its not ideal as someone with a full time job (that is very high stress and long hours), but I’ve made it work. Until the other day, she’d been happy as ever and living life to the fullest. I got her set up at a day care she loves, I developed a system to clean up after her when she has to go potty unexpectedly and throughout the night when I can’t get to her. 

She suddenly started seeming down a few days ago and then she started vomiting. Hasn’t pooped since she started vomiting. Turns out she has something wrong again in her GI tract. 

I’m worried it’s going to cost another 10k or so. I’ve already paid 2k for tests since her symptoms started up again. I just am having such a hard time with this. I’m worried that this is going to end up being a recurring issue. I’m decently well off financially but even still, a unexpected 10k is a serious blow, especially as I just finished graduate school and I’m starting up my savings again. I couldn’t get pet insurance after her spay issue because it became a preexisting condition.

She’s been an unimaginably good dog. Like a dream dog. It is painful to even think about it, but I’m getting concerned I can’t afford her. 

Im wondering if anyone else here has had to make a tough choice like this, and how they handled it. Does anyone have advice for how to weigh a decision like this? I just feel so alone and everyone expects I could just pay this off, but it’s not that simple. I have bad credit from some missed bills while in school, so some pet loan places won’t give me a loan, and those that do are going to gouge me.

600,dogs,"so, SO glad I got a golden instead of an Aussie… (for anyone on the fence)

I brought my golden puppy home a week ago, after obsessively researching dogs several months.  I was set on an Aussie or an English shepherd, admittedly because of aesthetics but also the allure of such intelligent breeds.  But I told a friend that if I were smart I would get a golden &amp; pretty last minute I ended up with a golden puppy instead of an Aussie or ES when I’d been seriously talking to breeders of each of those breeds.

Why? 

Having this puppy has made me realize how little I really knew about dog training. Even though I had dogs growing up, this is my first as an adult &amp; I’m raising him pretty much on my own.  
I’ve already taught my puppy to sit, lay down, roll over, &amp; am pretty well crate trained &amp; working on the potty training.  But I’m not very knowledgeable or creative about what else to teach on my own.  I’m also really not knowledgeable about teaching him to not bother my cat &amp; chickens too much, so I’m starting puppy classes this week to learn the basics &amp; expose him to other dogs.  I hope to train him really well to be comfortable in public, &amp; perhaps to help me out a little as person who suffers from an anxiety disorder.
Also, we went to a family reunion a few days ago &amp; I found out how much my puppy LOVES kids, &amp; he fell asleep on several laps throughout the day.  The only behavioural issues I had to worry about were not peeing in the house &amp; jumping on the kids too much.  But honestly?  That’s normal dog stuff &amp; im so glad I got myself a guy that loves people &amp; that I don’t have to worry about herding small children.. 

Anyway, I don’t know what this post is for other than to give myself a little credit &amp; encourage anyone like me who’s considering a herding breed to reconsider &amp; get a more forgiving breed like a golden retriever.  One of those herding breeds would have made my anxiety sooooo much worse &amp; that puppy stage is universally challenging for any breed.  Maybe someday I will get an English shepherd or heeler mix if I decide I want a 2nd dog, but for now I’m SO GLAD I got my boy Cosmo for a first dog. I know I’m doing a good job for him &amp; he’s spoiled rotten but I don’t think I could’ve been such a good owner for an Aussie.",t2_3ntpcu0o,0,"So, so glad I got a golden instead of an Aussie (for anyone on the fence)","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,101ejl6,True,opossum3000,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/101ejl6/so_so_glad_i_got_a_golden_instead_of_an_aussie/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/101ejl6/so_so_glad_i_got_a_golden_instead_of_an_aussie/,2477870,1672671434,0,,False,1672671448,1672671448,2023-01-02 14:57:14,,,,,,

602,dogs,"Just to start I AM NOT THE ONE SUPPORTING THIS OR DOING IT. I'm the one getting crap for saying my bfs mom shouldn't be hitting the dog to train him, not being a dog owner myself and actually never owning a dog nobody is taking me seriously and they're saying it's not harmful because she doesn't do it hard enough to hurt him. I'm not sure the timeline of how well trained dogs should behave at which ages but their dog is almost 1 year old and he's still having behavioral issues according to them like still jumping on people and biting people (playfully but it still hurts) even when they're not trying to play. They're telling me he doesn't listen unless she spanks him. Everything I've looked up online says violence is never the answer when training a dog but it doesn't specify if you can do it when it's not painful. The smacks she gives him are not just taps that's for sure, it's not hard enough to make him yelp but it's hard enough to make a noise when he's hit like a smacking noise. So are they actually right and i don't know anything about dog training or is it wrong that they hit him?

TLDR: mom's bf hits dog for training purposes, i say it's not okay and I'm told i am wrong bc she doesn't hit way too hard.

the CDC seems to indicate that she would would need the serology test since she has a “foreign issued” rabies certificate.

614,dogs,"I have a puppy/young adult dog that’s just over a year and about 65lbs. He is naturally timid of strangers. I have exposed him to strangers a lot growing up and he’s not horrible. After about 5-10 minutes he warms up to new people. He really does not like being approached in those first few minutes though. He will back away from pets/touch and be quite timid until the new person pretty much ignores him, treats don’t always work. He basically needs to get to know them on his terms. 

My concern is about an upcoming vet visit. His last visit he was maybe 7 months old and needed a blood test. It was during Covid so I got to take him into the waiting room but they wouldn’t let me back with him for the test even though he’s not good with strangers. He ended up trying to bite the tech (he’s never done that before and no incidents like that since, but he’s also never alone with new people) They were able to do the test still but I was told he would need antianxiety/sedative meds at future appointments. 

He is due for his vaccines soon and when I made the appointment I asked if I can be present for the vaccine and they said yes. I asked if he requires sedation and they said it was in his file from last time but it’s up to me. I said he might be ok if I’m present but I don’t know for sure, but ultimately they left the decision up to me. 

His appt is in a month, should I just buy they sedation or see how it goes? Last time he got vaccines it went ok but he was only 15lbs and the vet was in the room for a while beforehand which helped him get used to her. But now he’s much bigger and I’m also very very pregnant so I’m thinking maybe I should just give him sedation to make sure it goes smoothly? It does seem kind of extreme but I don’t want him to be afraid. Or I could get a muzzle and train him to wear one just in case?

It has spread rapidly to lymph nodes, I don't think another surgery would have made a difference and vets agree. Chemo is not a thing here and I am not very keen on it anyways. I want rest of her days to be comfortable rather than go for chemo and maybe have some weeks extra. At the moment she seems to feel very well.

So far no vet (I have seen 3, we go once an month for Librela injections and can't always schedule it for the same vet) has even suggested euthanasia because she is in so good shape.

624,dogs,"I got a half husky half chihuahua dog. Looks like a cute mini husky that barks when ppl knock on the door, but howls and growls at you like a husky. 

Anyways, idk what’s up with him. He won’t eat his food until he’s completely starving I suppose. His ribs show, not too much but they show. I’ve tried all kinds of dry food including for small breeds. I’ve even tried the wet canned food for a bit. He likes them at first, but then eventually grows out of it and doesn’t eat. I know he LOVES the refrigerated dog food they sell at stores and also human food. Thing is, I can’t afford to buy him that food all the time. And I don’t want to feed him human food as that can cause him worms I hear. Not just that, but I don’t want to give him human food nor want to buy him cooked chicken bc it’s the same thing (more expensive for me and I didn’t grow up that way giving dogs our food). 

He always sees me eat my food no matter what it is, and I look at him with sadness and annoyance and tell him to go away. He’s a sweetheart and I hate to see him go to bed hungry at night. 

Is there a place I can look for or a certain test or something I should do to get him checked out? He’s a happy dog always has lots of energy, but ever since he reached his full size, he’s always been SUPER picky with his food and therefore is skinny.

634,dogs,"Long story, TLDR at bottom. 

So I adopted my dog nearly 10 years ago (exactly in 2 weeks). We were inseparable. When I first got her, I worked two jobs to support us. I’d wake up early, drive across town to take her to day care, then drive back across town to work at the shelter for a few hours. Go home and take a nap. Then go back to the day care and work my shift there. I’d let her chill with me as much as possible when I wasn’t working with the other dogs.

After three months of the nonstop working, things got bad. I have a lot of issues. I’m bipolar and autistic. I also have severe anxiety. After dropping her off at day care one morning, on my way to my next job, I had a panic attack driving and totaled my car. I continued to have panic attacks every time I left my house and had to quit both jobs and move back home. I became agoraphobic and didn’t leave my house except when my mother would drive me to doctors. 

After about a year, thanks to my dog, I was finally able to leave my house again. I’d take her to the dog park and to craft stores and basically anywhere. I got her one of those ridiculous strollers and sat her in that. If I wasn’t sure if she was allowed, I would close it and cover it with a blanket (I did not do this in grocery stores or places that explicitly don’t allow pets and have such signs). I was planning on training her to be a service dog since I was placed on disability, but I just didn’t have that skill. But she basically was one. She had the keen ability to recognize when a panic attack was coming and climb on my shoulder and help lower my heart rate. She loved going out with me too. She would get so much attention from children that wanted to pet her and she just reveled in it. 

Anyways, years pass and we do everything together as she is absolutely my ESA. Unfortunately, my mental health issues become a problem again. Something that I’d been trying to keep buried came up and my PTSD became severe. I fought for a while. But after losing 100 pounds and no longer being able to sleep when given the strongest sedatives, I had to be hospitalized. And that lasted a lot longer than I thought. What I thought was be 6 months turned into nearly 2 years.

I tried to FaceTime with Lois, but she didn’t understand. I thought she would since she regularly watches TV, but she would just never look at an iPad or phone. Because it was during the pandemic, I was never able to visit. It was very lonely. I was in a completely different state away from everyone I knew for the first time in my entire life. And both Lois and I were going through some pretty bad separation anxiety.

As I’ve said, my mental health is shit. Lois is basically the only thing that’s kept me going for a while now. For some reason, the shit place I was in withheld therapy from me for over a year and I began having a mixed bipolar episode. No one would help me or listen to me and I escaped. Literally, in this place’s 75 years of existence no one has ever run away successfully. I was the first. And I made it home. 3 states away. 

Why did I leave? Because I had to. At that point I wanted to die and I hadn’t seen my dog in almost 2 years and the way my mom sounded on the phone, it seemed like I would never see her again. She was 9 years old and I felt her life slipping away. I just needed to know if I still had my dog, because if I had my dog, I had everything. I needed to feel love, because I hadn’t felt love in a very long time. 

Skip forward a few months and I finally get to come home for good! Let me tell you, those videos you see of kids coming home from college and soldiers coming home from war, not all it’s cracked up to be. I thought we were going to have a magical reunion. When I ran away, I was in big trouble, and Lois was sick, so she wasn’t her typical self. But now that I was back, I’d hoped our relationship could go back closer to our happy days.

While I was gone, she had gotten into a routine with my parents and I wasn’t a part of it. That was hard to swallow. She honestly didn’t want me at all. She would only let my dad throw the ball for her and only cuddle with my mom. It was very hard. I’ll admit, I cried a lot thinking that I’d lost my dog forever. 

A few months ago, things started to change. Before I left, her safe space was my room, it was also where she slept. When I left, she moved to sleep every night in her crate and just never went upstairs to my room anymore. Now, every time she is left alone, she goes up to my room for her safe space again. Some days, but very rarely, she would sleep upstairs in my bed again and when she did, it was different than the days of old. But every day since December, she has decided that she no longer wants to sleep in her crate and comes up to my room every night. Not only is she in my room now, but she’s cuddling with me under the covers

Thursday will make it a year since I’ve been home and I finally feel like she loves me again. It’s taken a while, but it was worth it for her. 

TLDR- my dog helped me through my agoraphobia and we became inseparable. Then I had to be hospitalized and we were separated for 2 years. She didn’t love me as much when I came back. Now, almost one year later, things are finally getting back to normal and I’m so happy!!",t2_5ce4a5w6,0,Story time: my dog loves me again❤️,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[OC]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,transparent,public,0,{},,498e611c-ffe1-11e0-a3fa-12313d096aae,True,,False,False,,{},[OC],1,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Lois Lane: Bochi'}]",{},,True,richtext,6,,richtext,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,d13864dc-b436-11eb-8347-0ebea1751d09,True,False,False,Lois Lane: Bochi,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#b30000,10150f3,True,LoisLaneEl,,2,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/dogs/comments/10150f3/story_time_my_dog_loves_me_again/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/10150f3/story_time_my_dog_loves_me_again/,2477716,1672639337,0,,False,1672639349,1672639349,2023-01-02 06:02:17,,,,,,True

636,dogs,"This post is about airline selection for flying with a fully grown Corgi who is for sure trained and comfortable with flying. 

My 1 year old corgi has been on a few flights with Southwest who is our preferred airline for flying with our dog. She's 26lbs and flies in a Roverlund which fulfills the size requires of all major airlines. 

She's fully trained in a couple different flight bags and crates and calm, cool, and collected on car rides which is probably the most similar experience you'll get to a plane ride. She's pretty good at restaurants as well but always wants to meet our neighbors. 

All airlines have very detailed guidelines on what they require from in-cabin dogs.
-Can she stand straight up?
  Kindve but with her head ducked. 
-can she turn around? 
   Yes. 
-does her body length match the length of the carrier? 
   She's a hot dog, so no. But she sleeps like a donut anyway. 

Southwest has never checked her carrier. But she's always super quiet when we're checking-in at the ticketing counter (you have to go thru the full-service lane). 

We tried to fly United and not only did they hurl insults at my dog. They literally called her smelly and sprayed at her with alcohol (she uses Isle of Dog and her butthole is probably cleaner than that luggage scale). 

They were convinced she's too long, tall and will suffocate under the seat. United is rude and delusional. That's not how plane cabins work unless you're a Pug. She's more likely to suffocate in cargo. 

TLDR: Southwest is very flexible with flying medium size (~26lb) corgi in-cabin carrier and you're unlikely to experience any issues.

656,dogs,"Hi there, we have been wanting a dog/puppy for about a decade now  (golden retriever is the one I had been set on) but I am currently halfway through a year of breast cancer treatment - looking to get a dog/puppy in Autumn 2023. If anything this whole experience has taught me to stop putting things off that I want to do in life! But a bit clueless on what breed would work well for us given slightly differing circumstances. Based in the UK.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

Yes, first dog for us both

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

Previously we were seriously considering a rescue dog - however I'm slightly concerned if these might be too hard for a first time dog owner if there are serious behavioral issues vs a puppy that you have from when it is young?

 3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

Friendly, capable to go on a decent length walk at weekends. Cuddly dog that is also happy to sit on the sofa with me if I have low energy in the evenings (plan on also hiring a dog walker and having doggy day care for mental stimulation) . Small/medium in size. Ideally not a heavy shedder or drooler. Don't mind a bit of barking but not constant everytime doorbell rings for instance. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

As above - previously a golden retriever but my concern is that as we only have a small garden and work full time from home, they would get really bored and destructive, I want to be able to give it a good life.

Now looking at slightly smaller breeds which would be happy with a small garden - have previously had experience with a cockapoo and a border terrier who were both quite sweet.

Don't want any ""fashionable"" city dogs eg. pugs, french bulldogs, dachshunds, chihuahuas. 

  5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

Beyond the usual commands my partner is quite interested in training to do more advanced obedience. We would like a dog that is easy to train.

  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

No

\*Care Commitments\*\*  

 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

At least 1 hour for training/playing

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

At least 1 hour on weekdays, longer at weekends. We live by lots of green spaces well used by dogs so they can interact and the dog would also go to doggy day care at least 1 -2 days a week for playing with other dogs.

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

Happy to do regular brushing. Would need to read up on grooming but in theory happy to do maintenance but also to pay a professional if too tricky.

\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

Small/medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Low shedding/hypoallergenic.

Can handle some barking but not constant.

Low drooling.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

I would like this but accept if it isn't possible - it's probably a 3/5 in terms of importance.

\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

Snuggly!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

Probably a mix of both - but would lean more towards doing its own thing so it can entertain itself during workday.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

Not barking when the door rings, friendly to strangers/visitors.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

I wouldn't like this.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

Excessive barking is the main one but also would want to avoid any breed known for having bad recall.

Stubborn dogs are also not a good match, I've previously looked after a dachshund and found it far too stubborn ie. digging its heels in on walks and refusing to walk in particular directions, whereas never found that problem with a cockapoo/golden retriever.

 \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

Infrequently, we both work from home so it would only be occasional evenings out where we could not take the dog (probably about once a week) and for max 4-6 hours.

 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

Partner and I are planning to split walking about 70% me/30% them. They want to take an equal role in training.

 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they? 

No and no

 21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

No

 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

No

 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  The UK - only pitbulls is what I'm aware of

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer - average 24 degrees but did get up to 40 this summer.

Winter - average 10 degrees

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

Been advised I could feel fatigue up to a year post my chemo treatment, so looking for a dog that does not have a 2 hours a day exercise requirement to not overburden my partner with walking.

657,dogs,"We have a 1.5 year old herding dog who has been the most joyful life loving puppy since we got her at 4 months. Her tail was always up and wagging, she played with toys and with us, and was a bit naughty (in a good way).

The main difference in the new house is the yard is not fenced so she is inside a lot more - we used to let her out for several hours a day and she would alternate chilling, chasing birds, and digging. She still gets lots of attention and two good walks a day.

This makes the room stink and we would much rather talk and her outside for a walk to let her use the bathroom; no matter what we do she just won't do it. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it!

Hi all,

Our dog is a 14 year old maltipoo mix and has a heart murmur. He’s generally pretty healthy for his age (active, has an appetite, plays with his toys, and has been responding to his vetmedin for the past three years with no increase in dosage). However, for the past month he’s been experiencing nasal discharge and excessive sneezing some days. The discharge is sometimes yellow but mostly clear and never bloody. We’ve taken him to the vet almost every week trying to figure this out. First he was prescribed clavamox which he sort of responded to, but continued to experience yellow discharge (it just lessened). He’s now on clindomycin as the vet said it could be a fungal infection. 

We love our dog and want to give him the best for his golden years. I know a tumor is a possibility, but we decided we won’t subject him to anything that will cause him to undergo anesthesia or radiation. He’s too far advanced in age and with his heart murmur we don’t think it’s a risk we’d want to take. For the most part he’s pretty active for his age and had some blood work done in the summer and an ultrasound that all came back clear (except a little elevated cholesterol so we’ve cut back on treat).

My question is, has anyone experience this? We’re not ready to let the little guy go and just want to make sure he’s comfortable.

And for the mods HES UNDER VET CARE, AND NOT IN DANGER THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. I’m just asking to see if anyone else has experience this??",t2_3m95rqb2,0,Anyone’s dog experiencing nasal issues?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,1010lfv,True,Miashkas,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1010lfv/anyones_dog_experiencing_nasal_issues/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1010lfv/anyones_dog_experiencing_nasal_issues/,2477637,1672625887,0,,False,1672625902,1672625903,2023-01-02 02:18:07,,,,,,

666,dogs,"I'm visiting my parents in south carolina and all of the dogs/dog owners I've met here have been lovely. Tonight I was walking my schnauzer with my brother-in-law and sister and a woman in her 60s was walking our way with a german shepherd and a medium sized (but chubby) mutt of about 40-50 pounds (just eyeballing it). 

The woman asked ""is it ok if we say hi?"" and I replied, sorry, my dog isn't great with larger dogs. (This isn't entirely true, but her dogs were straining to get to my dog and seemed very agitated.) Anyway, despite what I had just told her she continues walking our way because the dogs were basically dragging her along. (She was zero percent in control of them and was outweighed by quite a bit.)

My dog sensed their agitation and barked at them, at which point the german shepherd went for my dog. The woman got dragged along for the ride and after a moment of confusion (""oh, this is happening I guess"" went my thoughts), I got in between  the GS and my dog. Not knowing what else to do and not wanting to get tangled in a big knot of fighting dogs, I  grabbed the German Shepherd by the scruff and said NO in a firm voice. The woman finally managed to get her weight into it and held her dog off enough to the point where I could just keep walking, which we did. 

My dog was fine and the german shepherd didn't seem to be a bad dog, maybe just young and excited. But these things can escalate quickly (my dog takes zero shit from dogs he feels threatened by and doesn't realize he's 20 pounds) and I was glad to move on with no issues. 

But: what do you guys do in such scenarios? What do you do to prevent them in the first place?

667,dogs,"I’ve really been missing having my own dog and as I’m preparing to start medical school, I’m interested in taking to summer to get and train a puppy. I’m really looking for advice as to what breeds to look into, because I was interested in mini aussies but I’m not sure I will have the space (considering buying a house, but I also wouldn’t expect too much yard space, and definitely willing to adjust my living environment to accommodate the doggo). During the summer, I’ll be training the pup at my parents house, where I have my 9 year old family dog and about half of an acre of yard space. 

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my family has had a smooth collie mix for the past 9 years, for whom I was the main trainer and caretaker before leaving for college 4 years ago. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Slight preference for a reputable breeder just because I’m interested in a younger puppy and want a small-medium dog, but would totally rescue again!

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* 15-30 lbs, affectionate cuddle, biddable, happy with 1-2 hours of runs/walks per day (I would love a running partner, as I’m a runner who struggles to keep pace by myself). I really like intelligent dogs, and one that is friendly to strangers and other dogs would be preferable. Moderate barking is ok, but not at everything. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Collies, because of my current dog’s temperament, spaniels because they seem like they are okay with being active or chill, Bichon frisé I also liked but they seem very groom-heavy, which is a hard transition from a double coated dog who didn’t tolerate the groomer at all. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Normal commands, fetch, off-leash walking for trails, possible ESA

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* no

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours exercise together, and an hour or so of training per weekday, with more time on weekends

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours of walks/trail runs, possible walks in dog parks if the dog isn’t very reactive towards other dogs

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Willing to do weekly brushing, cleaning ears, would take to groomer for trims but likely every 8 weeks or so. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium, below 35 lbs

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Prefer minimal slobber, but fine with any amount of shedding and a good amount of barking if not at everything. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not the most important thing in the world, but would make walks on the park more efficient. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* would prefer to be welcoming to visitors, but ok if they bark at strangers

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, but would prefer not to

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Digging

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4-5 hours per day (should be able to squeeze in a noon walk) after the first few months

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* n/a

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 9 year old collie mix 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I may be renting, but don’t know about any restrictions yet

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Bully breed ban is anticipated

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* -20F to 95F",t2_clnvin9q,0,Trying to narrow down breeds for first adult dog as a graduate student,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,100zkwy,True,Mountain_Shock_9200,,2,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/100zkwy/trying_to_narrow_down_breeds_for_first_adult_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/100zkwy/trying_to_narrow_down_breeds_for_first_adult_dog/,2477617,1672623037,0,,False,1672623049,1672623050,2023-01-02 01:30:37,,,,,,

She’s not fixed and he absolutely refuses to fix her (I think he doesn’t want to pay the money). She smells bad like a “v”. No infection, nothing. She just smells? Even after I bath her… the blankets get smelly quick. Her periods are disgusting to deal with. Her hair is literally everywhere and I can’t wear anything without being covered anymore. I won’t let her in the bedroom cause I need a clean space. She’s very clingy… and will lay on my boyfriends feet. If he leaves the room, she follows him. She isn’t a fun dog. She has no personality. She just STARES at me all the time. 

I love dogs. I love my dog a lot. But I can not like this dog. I do everything for her. Brush her coat, brush her teeth, provide her bedding, feed her… blah blah. My grandma suggested taking her on walks and try to make a connection… but I feel nothing.

Does anyone else ever feel this way? Or have you struggled with it? She’s a constant argument for my boyfriend and I.",t2_tt69eqoy,0,I struggle to like my boyfriend’s husky…,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,100yu9j,True,yekcim90,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/100yu9j/i_struggle_to_like_my_boyfriends_husky/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/100yu9j/i_struggle_to_like_my_boyfriends_husky/,2477603,1672621011,0,,False,1672621025,1672621025,2023-01-02 00:56:51,,,,,,

I come here looking for advice. A dear friend of mine had a pregnancy/newborn issue that was serious enough that she had to seek medical care abroad. She is the owner of [Tato](https://ibb.co/wS9YCt2), a [7-year old Poodle Terrier mix](https://ibb.co/qMDxT6H). My friend's mother is housesitting, but apparently she's not into dogs. 

I volunteered since it's a (hopefully) temporary thing (fingers &amp; paws crossed for baby Dante's health) and mainly to give my good friend at least a bit of peace of mind. I have a tenant who has 2 other dog (A Garafian Shepard &amp; a Belgium-German shepard (who kinda of a dick)) but their human assures me that they are playful and friendly. Tato's human will be sending money for food and (I hope not) for vets. 

My friend has informed me that Tato is an inside dog, just goes outside 2-3 times a day to chillax and do his business. Gets fed biscuits and wet dog food 1-2 times a months. From previous experience, I told her to send an article of clothing of hers to put in Tato's sleeping area, so he won't feel that he's been abandoned and smell her scent. I have an ample front and back yard. Also, a smaller yard where laundry hangs. I would like to limit him to the back and small yard, to reduce the risk of him running outside into the street. I do have to clean the back yard because its littered with dead wood.

674,dogs,"I picked up a lab puppy at beginning of October after recently losing my 7 year old lab to kidney disease. Shortly after I rescued another 9 month old lab that was supposedly potty trained. 

To this day they are still not totally potty trained. 

I have a crate and put them in it anytime I leave for 2 hours or less, they still pee inside it. 

I have a large backyard with awning, anytime I’m gone for longer than 2 hours they go out there but that is hard itself because they keep destroying all my patio furniture (the puppy straight up ate an extension cord). 

I spend my days when I am home taking them in and out and giving them plenty of time outside so they can go potty. They still routinely come back inside after being outside for 2 hours only to pee inside in less than 5 minutes. 

My only saving grace appears to be that they have learned that the bedroom is a no-go zone at night. 

Today has been the worst though. It’s been raining in SoCal a lot but because I have my huge awning the dogs have still spent time outside in order to have time to go. 

EVERY SINGLE time they have come inside today they immediately pee. 

I’ve taken them out to the pee spot in the rain on the leash and they just look at me like I’m an idiot. They are not scared of rain because they’ve been playing in the rain and mud all day when I let them out. 

I have no idea how to teach these dogs to stop peeing inside the house.

677,dogs,So I have a 2 year old Pomeranian who I rescued at 8 months. My understanding is that she was a puppy mill puppy who was bought and then left in her crate most hours of the day and night and her owner got rid of her because she didn’t have the time to put in. When I got her we instantly bonded. I am disabled and can’t do much exercise or motion because of my disability but she has an amazing life. She gets lots of socialization with people because of friends who visit me and home nurse appointments and she’s great with people. But she hasn’t had much socialization with dogs. The few dogs she does know (like my neighbor across the street and my brothers dog) she’s great with but she is terrified of dogs she doesn’t know. She’s not aggressive she just either tries to hide under a chair/bench or she wants to be in my arms. Bc of my disability I cannot take her to the dog park. My best friend brought me back to her house (out of state from me) and my dog is terrified of her 3 month old puppy. Is there anything I can do to help her not be afraid? I hate giving her unnecessary anxiety and because I am disabled I want her to be able to play with other dogs so she’s not solely dependent on me or puzzles to get stimulation.

So I’m currently in an Airbnb now that I’ve been in for maybe 3 hours. My dog is very restless, just walking around sniffing, exploring etc. he has been eating so he’s not that anxious IMO bc there have been times where he eats less than usual the first few days of travel/ traveling in general. 

However, he won’t eat anything in the kennel and he will go in on his own immediately but then will sit up and immediately start crying and not eat his treat (as I always treat him for going in the kennel at home).

He is in the exact same kennel exact same blankets, exact same adaptil plug ins. We had a huge hike prior to coming in and he is still struggling To relax in the kennel. If he is out of the kennel, he is just roaming around the Airbnb. He is overstimulated and tired yet won’t sleep in the kennel. At home, he has no issues in the kennel at all.

685,dogs,"Hi Folks! 

I'm in the process of deciding on pet insurance for my dog and cat.  I've done the basic research on different agencies, monthly costs, deductibles, coinsurance and yearly maxes.  However, I was pretty unhappy with the insurance we used with our previous dog and cat.  Over time they raised the prices pretty dramatically whether we had claims or not.

I've read through the reviews, past posts, etc, but as I'm sure you all know, this is quite difficult to research.  So, I'm hoping for as much personal experience and anecdotes you all have with different companies.

I'm especially interested in the following: 

* Which company did you use? 
* What did your monthly premiums look like over time?  Was it a steady increase, or was there a point where it jumped up dramatically?
* Did they increase rates only yearly during your renewal, or did it increase during random times?
* If you had to make a claim, did you see a jump in price following it? 
* How was the claim process?  Did you ever have issues with getting payments/denials? 
* What was the customer service like?

If enough people chime in, I'm happy to collect all this data to put it into an easily reviewable format for other pet owners too. 

Note: I know that some people think pet insurance isn't worth it, however my financial situation is such that I need it.  I don't have the disposable income available to just handle a large bill tomorrow/get a credit card.  So when giving advice please don't tell me not to get it.

687,dogs,"In the summer of 2020, my dog (then my mom's dog that she has since rehomed me, Rhodesian-Pitbull mix) was hit by a car when he got loose. He survived with what seemed at first to be a fractured leg, some scratches, and no apparent head injuries. Prior to the accident, he was a very well behaved dog. While that could still be said now, something changed after the accident; he started becoming more aggressive with our other dog. Usually it would be like once a month. We thought that it was related to the other dog being blind or possibly because he wasn't neutered (still isn't, I'm planning on getting that done as soon as I'm done renovating my house). However, this didn't make sense as the agression started after his accident. Not to mention that the aggression started extending to the cats even killing my brother's cat and to my mom's now ex boyfriends dogs after being friendly with them for a few days. We've had him separated from other animals over the past few months. I tried talking with my mom about putting him down or dog training but my mom doesn't believe he should be put down.

I'm at a loss here. We don't want to have him put down, as he is loved by my family and he seems to have calmed down extremely since being separated from the other animals. Any advice?

690,dogs,"Questionnaire is below but just for a quick rundown, I live in a 1200 sqft open concept apartment with a courtyard, work from home, and have a chinchilla that stays in my room. I wouldn't consider myself extremely active but I do take daily walks and we have plenty of parks around. I've sort of narrowed my search down to a keeshond or eurasier but am open to any other suggestions and/or hearing first hand experiences with those two breeds.

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, first dog. I have no experience with dogs other than a few hours here and there with my friends' dogs during gatherings.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I already have a chinchilla, so I would need a dog that wouldn't stress him out too much. Ideally wouldn't be too drooly or destructive towards furniture. I live in an apartment so they would either need to be on the less vocal side or able to be trained to not bark as much. The apartment is a decent size and we have a courtyard space but I don't think a large dog is in the cards. I'm also interested in breeds that are not as commonly owned.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I like the look of spitz breeds but I'm open to any breed that fits my lifestyle. I've really taken an interest in keeshonden and eurasiers.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience is fine

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Most likely won't compete in sports and definitely won't need to do any work

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Other than my eight hours of work, I can spend all day with the dog lol

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At minimum three 30 minute walks a day, but would probably be closer to an hour. Probably go to parks/dog parks. Maybe some easy hikes once in a while.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

 * I can brush as much as necessary but probably won't feel comfortable enough to trim hair or cut nails. I am willing to get grooming professionally done.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

• Shedding I don't mind. Barking I would prefer to keep at a minimum since I live in an apartment. Ideally minimal slobber as well.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not majorly important but I think it would be beneficial for the dog.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm indifferent 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please, just because I assume they are easier to handle for first time owners 
    
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind a quick bark or two just to alert but it'd be better if they calm down quickly afterwards. I'm indifferent to how they greet strangers and visitors, as long as they're not aggressive.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes but I would prefer that not need to happen

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Just general aggression. Not a deal breaker but would like to avoid

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Very rarely since I work from home and don't have much of a social life lol. I imagine the longest they'd be left alone would be four hours at a time if necessary but I'm willing to hire dog walkers and/or take them to a doggy day care. Possibly an hour or two every few weeks if everyone is going out to eat.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My mom loves golden retrievers, huskies, and shiba inu (based off of pictures/videos she's seen on the internet) but she's never owned dogs before and doesn't really know much about them. She will probably walk them once in a while or play with them but most of the care will be coming from me. She's reaching retirement age so she just wants a companion to do leisurely activities with.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have one chinchilla and don't plan on getting any other animals

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I own my apartment/condo and there are no restrictions, but I personally don't think large dog would fit our living situation 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New Jersey, USA. I know there's some banned breeds but I don't think they are breeds I would be getting anyway 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer highs are 86F/30C and winter lows are 22F/-5C. We get all four seasons with humid summers and wet winters.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I live on the waterfront of an urban area that many people and kids (and dogs) like to walk along when the weather is nice, but is generally quiet most of the time. Once you get closer to the downtown area it does get pretty rowdy and busy (cars, loud music, people, etc.) I'm sure most dogs can get accustomed to that with proper training but just thought it might be relevant.

26) Questions

* Would it be better to keep the dog and chinchilla separate? The chinchilla's cage is kept in my room so I could theoretically just keep the door shut all the time but I would prefer them to live together in harmony rather than keep them hidden from each other. I don't plan on letting the chinchilla roam freely around the dog, I just don't want them isolated, if that makes sense.",t2_ertwe,0,[Breeds] Recommendations for first time dog owner with a chinchilla,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,100w3fi,True,Neonzz,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/100w3fi/breeds_recommendations_for_first_time_dog_owner/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/100w3fi/breeds_recommendations_for_first_time_dog_owner/,2477560,1672613848,0,,False,1672613862,1672613862,2023-01-01 22:57:28,,,,,,

693,dogs,"I love collecting and analyzing data, particularly on myself and my life. I decided to track everything we spent on our dog last year. We have a 2 year old 60lbs mixed breed dog, we live in a high cost of living city, and all expenses are split between 2 people. I wanted to share some of the analysis and insights I found interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spending by Category**

[Chart: Spend by Category](https://imgur.com/c1ivwAy)

[Chart: Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Spend](https://imgur.com/a/Nof9ZYG)

Contrary to what my partner initially thought, buying bandanas, extra toys, and new collars isn’t driving a large part of overall spending for our dog. The majority of our expenses are non-discretionary, with discretionary expenses only constituting 11.3% of spending. The top 3 categories of food &amp; treats, vet visits &amp; medication, and boarding &amp; daycare constitute 75.4% of annual spend, all of which were considered non-discretionary expenses.

I couldn’t get the data labels to show up for the two smallest categories of spend – the black is bedding (1.5% of spend) and the pink is transportation (0.4% of spend). Transportation cost reflects when we had to rent a car to take my dog to a specialist animal hospital. I didn’t include rental car costs when we rent a car on the weekend to take our dog to the beach or a hiking trail (usually once or twice a month), since we end up using the car for other errands and we also get enjoyment out of the adventure, so I didn’t view these as strictly costs related to our dog.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spending by Vendor**

We purchased from 28 different companies in 2022, but spend was concentrated across top vendors, with the top 5 vendors driving 75% of all spend. Unsurprisingly, the top 3 vendors we spent the most money with were Rover for daycare &amp; boarding (26% of spend), our vet (18% of spend), and the company we buy his fresh food from (16% of spend), with the top 3 vendors constituting 59% of annual spend.

&amp;#x200B;

**Frequency of Spending**

We had 163 different expenses for our dog last year. On average, we had an expense for him every 2.1 days. On average, we had a non-discretionary expense every 2.7 days and a discretionary expense every 13.4 days. The longest we went without spending money on our dog was 20 days, which was when we were out of the country for our wedding and honeymoon and he was with our sitter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost of Food**

[Chart: Food &amp; Treats Distribution](https://imgur.com/a/8smf451)

We feed a mix of kibble, fresh food, and raw dehydrated treats / chews. It costs $10.28/day to feed our dog, with his fresh food making up the majority of that cost. Kibble is 2/3 of his diet but only 15% of his total food cost. Treats &amp; chews are the most expensive on a standardized “per percentage” basis – this category is 5% of his diet but 17% of the cost, resulting in a multiplier of 3.4x vs. 2.4x for his fresh food and 0.2x for his kibble.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vet Visits &amp; Medication**

We had 9 visits to the vet this year – 2 visits for annual vaccines and the other 7 for diagnostic or checkups related to health issues. Our dog started experiencing urinary incontinence in February. We spent a lot on diagnostic testing at the vet and specialist animal hospitals. He’s now on daily medication, probably for the rest of his life. The medication can lead to hypertension, so he has to have his blood pressure checked regularly. We also had to bring him to the vet to induce vomiting because he destroyed and potentially ingested parts of a FunkoPop. Barring any new / unexpected health issue, I expect spending in this category to stabilize and be a smaller portion of overall spending this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seasonality**

[Chart: Spend by Month](https://imgur.com/a/riRQEm2)

Our monthly expenses were not consistent and could vary up to +/- 70% from the overall monthly average, with a standard deviation of $572. This was driven primarily by (1) the incontinence issue and associated diagnostic costs we had to pay for out of pocket before our insurance kicked in and (2) boarding and daycare costs being more ad hoc expenses tied to our return to office policies and vacations where we couldn’t bring our dog.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pet Insurance**

Pet insurance has been a worthwhile expense for us. We paid $382 in premiums but received $827 in reimbursements, leaving us with a net positive of $445 with the insurance company for 2022. Our deductible is $1,000 on a per-issue basis. We hit our deductible for the incontinence issue last year, so all expenses for this issue going forward will be covered at 90%. Based on how much his medication costs each month, we’ll be recouping 3x what we pay in premiums through reimbursements each year for this issue alone. I’m interested to see how the variability in monthly spend changes in 2023, as pet insurance coverage should reduce the large fluctuations in vet and medication spend we experienced in 2022 now that we’ve hit our deductible.

Hope this is interesting and helpful to anyone wondering where your money goes when you own a dog! I’ll continue to document all of our expenses to see how our annual spending compares in 2023. Happy to answer questions in the comments!

695,dogs,"The title says it all I guess. We really give our all to our dog, but even then, we’ve had multiple emergency vet visits in the less than two years we’ve had him and no matter how much we dog proof our home there always seems to be something new that could make him terribly sick or dead in an instant (mushrooms, raisins, his own leash, essential oils, xylitol, cosmetics, wild animals, the list goes on and on and on).

I don’t remember any of the dog owners I knew growing up being so vigilant and know many owners now who leave their dogs unattended outside to mixed success, but it’s hard to tell if that’s because I’m overreacting or some people are just more indifferent to the risks.

As much as I love him, I feel like my only choice is to do my very best, keep educating myself, and accept that if that isn’t enough to keep him safe, he just isn’t compatible with life in a human home… and given that’s his only option, any time we /can/ give him is the most he was ever going to get.

697,dogs,"My partner (27M) and I (26F) are looking for our first dog! Neither of us had dogs growing up so this will be a new experience, but we're willing to put in lots of time for research and learning and we have close friends with a lot of dog ownership experience to support us. We're planning to get the dog this summer (sometime around June-ish) so we have plenty of time to prep beforehand.

\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, we do not have experience owning or training dogs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* No preference necessarily, but we're a little apprehensive about rescuing a dog if their background/temperament/health concerns are unknown.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* We want an affectionate dog who likes to play outside and go on occasional hikes with us in the mountains. Being good with family and kids is also important.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Golden retrievers and labs because they seem to be good beginner dogs that are not too difficult to train and will be friendly to other people and dogs.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands and recall are the most important to us right now. We want to trust our dog to be off-leash in spaces where they can run around (hikes, dog parks, etc)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We're thinking of devoting \~1 hr per day for more focused training and playing but want to interact with our dog casually more than that.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* About 30 mins daily and we can take them to a large, open-space dog park every 1-2 weeks.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We can brush regularly and are open to learning how to do simple grooming at home. Also willing to bring to a professional groomer every once in a while

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium or medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, but barking and slobber less so

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Definitely a snuggly dog!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* No strong preference, but leaning towards eager-to-please for ease of training

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* We're looking for a friendly dog who will be happy to meet new people

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* If we have to we can learn that, but would prefer a dog who is well-socialized

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* We'd like to avoid dogs that are aggressive and/or destructive, particularly dogs that need *very* high activity levels to avoid those behaviors

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* At least 3 days per week for \~8 hrs during the workday. We both have semi-flexible WFH schedules but do need to go into the office

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not for a few years

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Denver, CO, USA (no dog breed restrictions and many many dog owners)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer: 60° - 90°
* Winter: 20° - 45°

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We have a fenced-in backyard with a lawn. Our neighbors have an overhanging crabapple tree that has historically dropped *lots* of fruit into our backyard (looking to get this fixed soon). Several neighbors we share the fence with also have dogs. Our neighborhood has foxes, squirrels, rabbits, and mice that come into the backyard.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

* Any tips for dog-proofing a house?

It’s not just kibble, if we find something he likes and then keep re buying that item, after a short while he grows bored of it and stops taking it.

We were not super worried about this at first; mom has a big back yard. As time has gone on, he digs more and has brought the digging inside, and has damaged the carpeting in multiple rooms. What might be driving this and how can we reduce this behavior? 

For most of his life we had a second dog, who passed away about 3-4 years ago, and this behavior change is more recent.

Mom's work tends to keep her out of the house for large portions of the day, so if the dog needs more activity, what can you recommend that we can do for him while mom is away?

708,dogs,"Hi Everyone,
In April this year I need to go to Bucharest from Grenoble for 3 weeks and I really don't know how I can bring my dog with me.
She's a 7 month cavapoo, and she's a bit on the big side. She's 8kg already and would fit not very loose and without being able to turn into a 50*35*23cm soft bag. The bag is around 1,3kg (link of what bag I was thinking to buy https://www.amazon.fr/gp/aw/d/B0999BFP6N/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A1V8OS9UPBD6DA&amp;psc=1 or https://www.amazon.fr/gp/aw/d/B093PSFMMS/ref=ox_sc_act_image_2?smid=A3VS2A9O2PN6CW&amp;psc=1 )
She is not an emotional support animal, but from what I've been reading, it doesn't matter that much in Europe.
I don't want to take into consideration the cargo of the plane, because she is very anxious, and I foresee a trip lile this at least every year.
I know there are airlines that allow 10kg dogs (Vueling, Volotea, Air Baltic), including the carrier bag, however none go to Bucharest. 
I saw that FlixBus and Blablabus don't accept dogs, and travelling by train all the way to Romania seems like a nightmare.
I've been looking for options for the airports in Lyon, Geneva, Paris, but I can't seem to find anything. Even flights with 1 stop are ok, as long as she can be next to me in the cabin.

716,dogs,"I have 2 labradoodles, sisters/littermates, going on 14 years old. One of them has had a severe skin issue for nearly a year. We can't figure it out. Several vets can't figure it out. I'm looking to see if anyone has had the same experience and any advice.

It started behind her neck and has spread to about 50% of her body, the backs of her legs, under her tail, behind her ears on top of her head and some patches on the side.

Basically her hair is falling out, skin is going black in some areas and her skin ""oozes"", creating a sticky substance.

At first the vet thought it was Cushings, but after tests it was determined not to be so. Then maybe fungal, so she wagon several rounds of meds without improvement. Then maybe diet, so we did sensitivity testing and put her on a hypoallergenic diet, still no improvement.

She is always pawing at her ears, so we have drops for that, but still no improvement. She is always in some level of discomfort, but otherwise has been very energetic, always eating, no other issues.

In the past few days she seems to not hear or see well, has become a bit lethargic and isn't eating much.

727,dogs,"Not a native English speaker, so please bear with me 😅

**Introduction**  

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

* Had a German shepherd since i was 10, she lived for 14 years and i had to put her down because of a cancer. Also from 10 years old i had 3 cats (they still live at my parents in different city), currently have 3 cats of my own (two of the cats are saved from animal shelters and one is from street). Also during my years at university, my ex of a long time relationship had 2 dogs, a collie and an east European shepherd (and whatever other breed made her huge in size compared to normal east European shepherds) mix. So i don't feel like a complete novice at least about shepherd breeds.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?  

* Prefer reputable breeder only, as i like at least German shepherd sized dogs (don't know in some places they are called large in some medium sized) and i'm planning of having family in the future, and i want to be sure that the dog will be psychologically stable, without having to play genetics roulette and having uncertainty on the dogs aggression. Also in my mind it would be easier to teach the small puppy to live with other animals together.

3) Describe your ideal dog.  

* I would prefer highly intelligent, could be trained (i'm prepared to work a lot with it so it can be not as easily trainable as a GSD, but with a lot of work it could still achieve some results), mostly i would like for it to manage to live with cats, or at least for it to possibly to be trained, not to be aggressive with them or react somehow badly back if the cat would be not in the mood for its attention (hisses to its face or slaps him with a paw, (we always clip cat's nails so the doggo wouldn't be in any danger). Another quality would be that from character standpoint it would be independent like a cat, would come to get attention only when he wants, wouldn't try to please the owner all the time, would sometimes re-challenge the boundaries.
Yes, i have a feeling that to have both independence and trainability are mission impossible, so i would prioritize trainability and friendliness towards other animals.
 
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

* From what i observed in some dog shows and from my searches about some breeds on the internet, and also from some friends dogs, i love Czech Wolfdogs, their characters literally are cat-like, they can be cuddly, they can be completely wild and bring the chaos to your home. But i'm concerned that it might be not possible to train them to live with another animals as they have really strong instincts. The same character i observed in my friend's Australian cattle dog, but i like my dogs being big and cattle dog is a bit too small for me. Another choice was WSS, as they are friendly with their family (including family animals) and are highly trainable. And the last choice was Golden Retriever as they are fluffy goofballs who most likely would get along with cats, but i'm not sure about their trainability and obedience, so would like to hear more about that from their owners.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

* To get along with cats and not to chase them instinctively would be a start. I have trained one of my cats to walk on a leash, come to me, sit, wait and give a paw, go to your carrier (useful when other cats hate being put to carrier and this one fella follows the command and goes in without any issues) with a lot of work you can even train a cat, so technically like my previous dog, it should know the basic commands like sit, lay, nearby, come to me, stay.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

* I would like to go with it to the dog shows, so i think obedience is always included in those shows, wouldn't be against agility too.
During the time with my first dog, we had some training in agility, but we never went to dog shows with her, afterwards i made a small agility course in my backyard and we did some trainings on the weekends.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

 * Workdays 1,5 hours for walks, weekends half a day or even more for training, walks, playing and so on.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

* We have friends with dogs, also we plan on getting a house with 8-9 acre backyard (dog only after getting the house so mostly after 1-2 years), most of exercise i plan on doing in my own backyard (and god no i wont let the dog out to run by itself in a backyard without my presence), from time to time we would go for a walk on a dog friendly nature trails.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

* For trimming professional groomer all the way, and home washing when the boy gets dirty. Don't know how regularly it is needed, but at least with long haired cats you wash them once a month and they are fluffy and pretty for the rest of the month, at least cat nail clipping is regular (somewhat once in one-two weeks)

**Personal Preferences**  

10) What size dog are you looking for? 

* German shepherd sized or bigger. So i guess medium to extra large/gigantic? More in size, more of it to love 😅 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

* Shedding is not an issue, barking is a big no as the cats hates that (in my previous experience, my dog almost never barked only communicated through whining, she was a super gentle girl). Drooling, well it shouldn't drool like tons, preferably i would like for really little drooling dog, or the one who only drools when sees the food 😅 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

* Nope, i prefer always having dog on a leash when im outside (unless its my own backyard), you would never know what kind of chasing instinct would kick in, and something would happen either to the dog, another animal or for some sort of stranger.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

* Yes to both. More like a cat, likes personal space, but gets snugly when he prefers to.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

* Definitely wants to do its own thing, its more interesting this way, the dog is more alive and keeps the house lively.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

* Protective/wary of the complete strangers, but if it sees that i know that stranger that he would be either friendly or at least ignore their presence then.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

* No. I would like for it to be trainable to get along with other animals. Would like to socialize it as much and as early as possible.  

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

* Would like to avoid howling, but its not like the biggest trigger, and maybe separation anxiety.

**Lifestyle**  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

* Technically for the half of the weekdays we work from home, another half we go to the office. So two days where we are not at home 9-10 hours with the travel included, but my office is dog friendly zone, so i intend to take it once a week in there.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

* We with fiance would be both caring for it, but for the training related things would be that person who would be chosen by the dog as their human/owner (had previous experience where GSD chose me as her human and wouldn't listen during training to anyone else except me, i have beliefs that that choice should be honored).  
He would like to have Golden retriever as he liked their friendliness, energy, attention loving and giving lots of love dog. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

* We have 3 cats, all of them are rescues (2 female tabbies and the third one is long haired black cat, my bestest goodest boy). One of them is too alpha, she grew up with my ex'es dogs and both of those dogs were afraid of her as she would sneak attack the dogs if they went out of the line (kind of jump scares them), she does the same with other cats when they become feisty and start zoomying around the home. Technically she keeps them all in line from destroying our home 😅 other cat only hisses when confronted by new animal. She always plays with my third cat. My third cat (black boy) is the one who i've trained some commands + walk on a leash, he is super friendly and always tries to go into a contact with other animals (initiates it), but often other animals do not want to go into contact with him 😅 so he patiently just sits nearby them until they acknowledges of his presence, stops being feisty and starts getting friendly with him. At the moment his success rate is 1 out of 2 😅

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

* After some time, in the future it will be (kids are in the plans). I intend to teach my children to act properly and to love animals.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

* Nope  

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

* I live in one of the Baltic countries and there are no restrictions that i would be aware of towards banning the certain breeds, but there are restrictions for some breeds to be always in muzzles when being walked.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

* Average summer temperature is around 20 Celsius (68F), winter around -5 Celsius (23F). We have a really rainy weather most of the time in here.

**Additional Information and Questions**  

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

* Would like to hear your experiences with those breeds and maybe some suggestions about what breeds would have similar qualities, so i could look more into them :)

730,dogs,"Hello,

My partner and I are thinking of traveling to the EU (Italy) for an extended stay. We both work for ourselves remotely, but both have dogs. We have researched the requirements for Italy, and it seems they are amongst the most dog-friendly destinations in that part of the world. Obviously, we'd like to bring them along for the journey, but have some concerns.

We have: 1x small \~20lb Beagle and 1x \~30lb mix\*\*.\*\* Their temperaments are agreeable and both are in good health.

The beagle is about 5 years old and quite the adventurer. She grew up in a city, has been across the US on several roadtrips and even sailed the high seas on a boat - loves *EVERY* second of it. She has some separation anxiety, but it's usually centered around keeping the pack together when we are out as a group.

The Mix is just over a year old and learning similar travel habits quickly. She is the more cautions of the two, but is generally easy going and extremely adaptable. She doesn't have separation anxiety, but is still somewhat fearful of loud noises. However, as she grows older this fear seems to be subsiding.

It seems the general consensus is that airlines have become strict with their in-cabin requirements, so at least one of the dogs (if not both) would have to fly cargo. Our hope is to get the tiny beagle in-cabin, but also worried because she can be loud.

We are weighing the risk/benefit of flying dogs in the cargo. It seems a lot of airlines have stopped this service completely, although the numbers show that incidents during these voyages are a low percentage. So while we're excited about the prospect of living overseas, we are trying to not traumatize our dogs on the roundtrip journey.

SO - anyone out there willing to share their personal experiences traveling to the EU (Italy) with their dog(s) in the last year? Ex. agreeable airlines, security, cargo and/or arrival experiences.

This is the second New Year with our dog. Last year she was a bit anxious when fireworks went off but fine after.

Two nights ago I went on a walk with her when minuetly fireworks were already fired. She didn't care at all except for one rocket that was a bit closer to us and she was also able to see the firework in the sky.

But after last night she has become so panicky unlike I have ever seen before.

Right now people are shooting fireworks again and we are able to hear them.

She is almost catatonic. She is just standing in the hallway barely moving and won't react to anything we offer her as a distraction no food no cuddles. Not wanting to leave the hallway. Totally tense body language. And reacting to almost any noise she hears.

I don't know what to do to distract or comfort her. It's making me worry so much.

734,dogs,"They make it impossible to visit her. They think they own the house, her, and everyone who comes in and all their stuff. They piss and shit everywhere, even at 6 years old or older. They bark incessantly at 4am, they jump up on top of you while you're asleep and just sit on you, like they're dominating you - which they'll also do if you're lounging, cooking, cuddling or eating. They're jealous and spoiled and completely untrained, and my partner is only now trying to discipline them - badly. So when I visit, they're just super confused about why they suddenly can't run the house. So they do it anyway, and my visits to her house consist of watching her start telling her dogs off and then instantly petting and cuddling them because she'd probably rather die than say no to them. Or otherwise,, she looks miserable that she can't let her dogs do whatever they want. I feel like an asshole for not being okay with it all - but I have chronic issues with both my sleep and with extreme mess. The restless nights  paired with the overstimulating, never ending supply of piss and shit that i step in the second I'm out of bed, while my partner gives them positive reinforcement for gross behaviours... its a Hell designed for me. 

I know it's not their fault, they should have been trained. I was always a dog person - but now im realising that, maybe, I was always a well-behaved-dog person. I can't make myself like any living creature who thinks it owns me and makes me clean up its fecal matter every single morning after keeping me up all night - maybe my own pet or child, but not someone else's. 

I usually avoid her house but I can't always do that while being a decent partner.

My son is sweet and loves dogs and all the other dogs in his life love him.  We've thought that maybe it's a dominance issue because my son is meek and lacks confidence and the lab was raised by an obvious alpha personality and didn't get a ton of socialization growing up.

The dog has never been abused but for when her pregnant mother was abandoned by their owner and then chewed her front leg off.  She was just a few days old puppy at that time and was shortly after given the amputation and then moved in with my boyfriend.  She loves both my boyfriend and I to bits and never shows aggression towards us.

My son comes to stay every other weekend at the house the dog is in.  Like most teenagers, he's in his room most the time so he doesn't spend a ton of time with the dog but when he does, she growls, hides her head under the coffee table and acts very uncomfortable.  UNLESS he has a treat or toy.  She will readily play fetch with him, and she will take treats from him.  We have him feed her her meals when he's here and play fetch with her but once the enjoyable thing is done, she will go right back to growling.

To our knowledge, no one has mistreated her in any way, she has a pampered as hell life at my boyfriend's.  I've witnessed all my son and her interactions and he's never even accidentally hurt her.  She has showed wariness of some other people in my family, but never the outright aggression she shows toward my son.

744,dogs,"\*\*Basically looking for a small or medium dog with a strong chance of being good off-leash, up for long hikes at weekend, jogging most weekdays, playing frisbee/ball fetch and training/playing at home. I would like an easy-going dog that doesn't usually tend towards reactivity. I don't need the dog to necessarily LIKE other dogs or strangers (I'm fine with them being aloof/uninterested), but I just would prefer a breed that parents won't cross the street to avoid when they see us outside the school gates.

\*\*  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* Not my first dog. I've had 2 dogs in my adult life. One a rescue collie cross and the other a sighthound raised from a pup.

  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* Breeder  

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Described in introduction  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* Anything that fits the description.  

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* Basic obedience. Fetch/frisbee. Off-leash hiking/running partner. Games.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

\* No  

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

\* 1-2 hours physical exercise + games and training at home. I work from home so will be around all day for general companionship, but obviously do need to actually work for some of the time!!  

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* 1-2 hours physical exercise. Walking, running, hiking, fetch/frisbee, and yes a dog park is nearby.  

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

  \* Happy to do general things like brushing, teeth cleaning, baths and nail clipping . Would prefer a lower maintenance dog than one that needs a lot of work in that regard.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Small or medium. If medium, nothing near the large size of medium. Between 12 and 20kg ideally.  

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Some shedding is ok (we have a roomba), some barking is ok but not too much (we have neighbours), and don't like drool. 

 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* It's one of the most important things to us.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Don't mind too much either way.  

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\* Eager to please. I had a sighthound and didn't like it's independent/hard-headed traits.

 15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* Ideally just not care. Being happy to see them would also be fine. I do not want a guard dog.  

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* No.  

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* I want to avoid reactivity/aggressiveness.  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* Occasionally for a few hours. When we go out to the shops, movies, dinner, etc. Won't be left on a regular basis because I work from home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* My partner will be equally involved. Her preferences are the same as mine.  

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* No  

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* Yes  

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\* No  

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* Europe. No laws that I know of.  

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Temperate climate. Warm summers and mild winters.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

We live in a small country in Southern Europe where the range of breeds available through trustworthy breeders is much smaller than in the US/many northern European countries. So less common breeds are rarely available here.",t2_8sj8i8lj,0,Breed Recommendations?

745,dogs,"I have had animals my entire life.  Have been lucky to not have needed too many expensive procedures and have always had my pets up to date on immunizations, etc.

I have an older rescue dog (rat terrier mix) that has horrible teeth and could use a good cleaning and possible extraction (s).  So, just received an estimate from my vet and it was between $818-$1124 range….SERIOUSLY!  WHO CAN AFFORD THAT?

Also, when I was last there (two weeks ago where I spent $750…gulp) I got vaccines for her and our kitten that need a booster in three weeks that I agreed to, only to figure out AFTER that the booster was not included in the estimate when I agreed to the vaccine.  She even made a point of saying if the booster is not given than it was a waste and would not be effective.  SO WHY WAS THAT NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE?  I’m sorry, I understand that they are running a business but I feel like the prices are out of control and I highly doubt I will return.

So, I took the dog with me. 

 Long story short, I was in for a big surprise. Did not expect the dog to react this way.

I'm sorry if this post isn't allowed but I just wanted to share my girl's birthday. We had a really rough year in 2022, she had two surgeries in May and July and we weren't sure if she'd still be with us. 

She obviously pulled through the surgeries well, despite complications, and gave us all a scare! The vet diagnosed dementia recently, that's the term they used with us but I understand it's Canine Cognitive dysfunction. I posted for advice over on the dog advice sub Reddit and thankfully some of the tips are helping! She's doing great and sleeping at night.

Since it's her 13th birthday and everything she's been through, we are spoiling her today with different cuts of lamb(in moderation to avoid upset tummy) and making an extra fuss with her.

I love her to bits, I've had her since she was around 4-5 months old and I dread the time to say goodbye. For now though, I want to cherish every moment I have.

752,dogs,"\*\*\*\* DISCLAIMER: pls do not listen to my info on this rant, because it could be totally wrong, i just want to clarify if it is. I do not want to spread misinformation.\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I lOVE golden retrievers sooo much, but there are a couple things bothering me with the breed. The first thing is the popularity. I want a breed that people have to ask what it is, and a breed you don't really see everyday. Also with popularity comes, over breeding, which can lead to bad genes being bred into the breed. 

Another thing that bothers me is the health. I know ya'll might hate me for this but, some breeds are unhealthier than others, like a pug is no compare to the ACD, and golden retrievers happen to be on my list on not the healthiest. I think we can blame the bad health on irresponsible breeding tho. 

Finally the last thing that I'm worried about is their friendliness. I'm not going to talk about this one too much because again it might make people upset, but I'm kinda worried about bad temperaments being bred into the breed. I want a really, really friendly dog, and the fact that some can go really wrong because of bad breeders, scares me. I mean i overthink things a lot so that might be just me but again, still one of my worries. 

But besides my rant, is there any other breed that has a very friendly distribution like the golden, and has some of their size, and temperament, but is not too common, or over bred?

Thank you so much for reading the whole thing, and listening to my annoying, probably wrong rant!!

765,dogs,"We're planning on getting a puppy toward the end of the year and after much thought and research we've narrowed it down to one of these two breeds. If we go with an Aussie it'll be a female because we were looking for a small/medium dog and smaller would be better.

We've read all about their needs for physical activity, mental stimulation, having a ""job"" to do, etc. and they also seem similar in terms of being sensitive, preferring not to spend much time alone, etc. I have found good breeders of both who would pick out a pup that seems calm and suitable as a family pet. We both work from home and we run, cycle and hike regularly. We will train the dog daily, do obedience classes, puppy socialisation, etc. from day one. 

So with all that in mind, is there anyone that has experience with both breeds and can enlighten us a bit more on the differences? Or are they more or less equal in terms of a pet for an active family? I really don't know which one to go for because they seem so similar and opinions seem split on how they differ! I know Aussies are more vocal and have heard they are supposedly a bit more wary of strangers?

769,dogs,"Okay to start it off with some context, he started limping (front right paw) around 4 days before Christmas. I was snowed in and couldn’t get to a vet as nothing was open. I was also using the wait and see approach as to see if maybe he was being a bit dramatic. That seemed to work, he stopped limping before Christmas morning &amp; I was incredibly relieved. He’s an 8 year old chihuahua mix and is my best buddy. I came home from work yesterday morning as I work the graveyard shift to find him limping again, but this time it seemed worse. He will put some pressure on it while eating and while laying down he will stretch it out to lay on his side. It’s Sunday today or I would be at a vet because I’m not sure what could be the cause of this. I’ve felt up and down his leg putting mild pressure on almost every part of his front right paw and leg. He does not whimper or seem in pain over this. I’ve noticed his back toenail is sort’ve long so I plan on cutting that today to see if maybe the reason he is limping is because the nail is causing some discomfort leading the limp.

770,dogs,"Hey guys!   


I foster puppies for a nonprofit. Right now we have 13 newborns, the baby momma, and my actual dog.   
When baby momma first got here, we had another dog that taught my dog how to eat poop. Then my dog taught the puppies how to eat poop.   


Starting with the puppies - they eat poop ravenously. We have gotten to them within maybe 60 seconds of them pooping and they eat it before we get there. Other times puppies will puke up the poop and then they all eat it - again, before we can get there.   


My actual dog has become food-crazed. Right around the time that other dog taught her how to eat poop, she had been having wicked behavioral issues around food. She eats paint off the walls, cloth and wood from furniture, legos/toy soldiers, grass, Christmas tree ornaments, computer cords, towels, and lots of other bizarre things. She's very shy and submissive but lately she's been developing food aggression. She's not gnawing on them like some dogs do, she's swallowing and hardly even chewing. She learned that boxes and bags have things like chips or flavor powders in them so she's been going through our pantry and literally tearing them open to eat them. She's a shy and submissive dog and usually I can impress people with how discipline and well behaved she is, but she's been turning aggressive and consciously disobedient if she can get food. She's turned to eating poop, too. I think the only time she ever really bit me as a real bite was in the face when I took a log of poop away from her that she brought in the house. She got my lip/gums and I couldn't speak without spraying blood everywhere.   


We took my actual dog to the vet several times and they keep saying ""everything's fine"" and that she just does it because she observed another dog doing it. Their only advice is to watch her when we take her outside, clean poop up before she can eat it, and make sure we are feeding her enough. My dog is obese from eating too much. I'm also in the military and I take her out on runs with me to work some of the fat off, but it feels like she's getting fatter faster than losing weight. We give as much time as our schedules can spare to babysit her and make sure she doesn't do it, but she won't stop. She knows it's bad and the whole neighborhood has heard me yelling at her when I caught her, yet she doesn't care. She just keeps eating poop.  


Anyways, the puppies too are now poop-crazed, not food-crazed. When one of them poops, we've got like 30 seconds to clean it before the entire pile has been devoured by one and the others. When one pukes up poop, the others just come in and eat it up. They aren't even that food crazed. They just want poop.

780,dogs,"My in-laws wanted to celebrate Christmas with my husband and I today. We left at 4 and got back at 8 to a totally flooded bathroom and our dog just chilling in the sink. He’s 11 years old and usually he cries a bit when we leave and then settles down in his crate. Tonight however he opted to break out of his crate and ended up shutting himself in our guest bathroom. We never use this bathroom and in the year that we’ve owned the house, we’ve never used the shower/tub in it. I didn’t even realize that the drain had a stopper in it.  

He’s terrified of fireworks and what I think happened is that someone started celebrating New Years early. When this happens, he’ll literally climb my husband and I like a tree and turns into a 20lb shaking pile of terrified goo. There is no reasoning with this dog when he’s like this. No medication or treatment has helped and we’ve tried everything. He most likely was jumping in and out of the tub and turned on the water. Thankfully he just turned on the cold water and didn’t burn himself. Then he got sick of the water and just settled down in the sink. When I opened the door, he just looked at me with his big judgmental brown eyes like this was all my fault. 

I’m not sure if this happened when he was trying to get out of his crate or if he was biting the bottom of the bathroom door after he closed it, but he broke one of his front teeth. It’s at an angle and loose now. He let me touch it and wiggle it around so I don’t think it’s hurting him. He’s the type of dog who is super dramatic when he’s in any sort of pain (real or not lol). He once cost us $675 when I broke my ankle a few years ago. He saw me hobbling around the house and decided to imitate me. Our vet almost peed himself laughing. We don’t have an emergency vet available and most likely will not be able to see anyone until Tuesday. He actually just had a check up December 6th and the vet said to watch that front tooth bc it had a slight crack in it so I shouldn’t be surprised he broke it but man do I feel guilty. He’s been eating and drinking just fine and while I really don’t believe he’s in pain, I feel like a total piece of crap and like I’m a terrible dog mom.

What will happen if you do not have enough money to care for the dog halfway?

What if you need to go back overseas cause a relative passed away
Who will take care of the dog?

It says to foster a dog you will need to bring the dogs to pet adoption event but you don’t own a car to drive the dog there what do you do?

Can you be “fired” to be a foster parent?

To those that is fostering a dog with your family 
How do you get all of them to agree with you to foster?

And if you were to be in a serious situation where you need to put the dog back to the animal shelter 
Will you still be able to be a foster parent?

Today, for the first time, my 2 year old dog instantly became hostile towards another dog— a 10 month old mixed breed— as it entered the park (we had been playing for nearly an hour). Of course, the owner of the other dog became very displeased (telling me to get ‘that thing’ away from their dog) so I just took my dogs home. I was a little heart broken they saw my dog as some monster but I know my dog was misbehaving. What happened was: My 2 year old instantly got tunnel vision, ran towards the new dog, and jumped on them as if it was a threat or a chew toy; the other dog was growling and tried to get away but couldn’t run very fast, resulting in a barking-biting clash. I pulled my dog away. My 10 month old was unfazed (as if the dog was no different than any of the several others in the park).

802,dogs,"Does anyone have any suggestions about what a dog could see in a fully fenced suburban Australian backyard that could totally spook and stress him for a couple of hours afterwards?  

I took my 5 year old poodle cross outside for his morning routine, and while I was facing the other direction he started barking and running towards one corner of the fenced yard, absolutely petrified. 

I tried to get him around the back after it and he just went flat, cowering on the path too scared to move. 

There was nothing there when I turned around, and this behaviour is out of character for him so I can’t fathom what he saw! 
He often barks at birds and cats but isn’t scared and stops immediately. 

As I said I’m in suburban Australia in a tall, fully fenced yard so something like a fox isn’t really an option. A snake would be the most likely unwelcome visitor but I’ve never seen one in my backyard

I don’t even know if he would react to a stranger in the yard like that but that and a snake are the only thing I can think of!

I took him back outside later and he seemed petrified and actually whimpered on my lap when I held him. 

It’s been about 2 hours and he has just started to settle now but I think if I took him back outside he would do it again

803,dogs,"Hi all, I'm not too experienced with some of the more difficult dog behaviors so I'm hoping someone could offer some advice. 

I recently took in a 10 month old Yorkie/Chihuahua mix. He's wonderful and I love him so much. He loves to play but he's also such a snuggly guy, he just has a really sweet disposition. 

The only problem so far is his anxiety in new spaces around new people and his protectiveness of me. I've had him for about a month now, and know next to nothing about his past history. When I take him to new places (indoors) he shakes so bad when we first get there. And in the case of the vet yesterday, he barked at the vet/vet tech and would not let anyone touch him until the vet had done like a full five minute introduction. Even then, he still would not let her check his ears. Once he was separated from me and in the back the rest of his exam went flawlessly. 

Which kind of leads to the next issue, he seems to be so much more wary of people and barks at them a ton when he's around me. If I leave the house, my whole family can walk around the house while he's in my room and he'll be silent. But when I'm home with him in the room, he barks and growls at every sound even familiar ones like the door across from mine opening. 

My previous (and first) dog was literally a fully trained angel when I got her. She was always so sweet and welcoming to people, and she rarely barked, so this is something I'm not really used to.

807,dogs,"(PSA we do not want neighbor or vet advice. We are working on communicating the issues with our neighbor to local health and we are in regular communication with our vet. Our boy is doing perfectly fine…. Except for the leaky butt).

Two days ago our golden retriever vomited up pieces of wood, we immediately took him to the ER. We found pieces of a wooden stake in our yard, no idea how it got on our property. One of the theories is our neighbor who piles trash up against our privacy fence, we think the stake fell or was pulled through by our dog. We frequently have trash blown into our yard so this is the running theory- quite literally have no other ideas how this boy got a two foot long stake. 

REGARDLESS this dumb dog ate a stake. He’s good, radiology shows no perf or obstruction. He was placed on an antibiotic and anti inflammatory for the week and the “sick boy diet” of rice and chicken.

Que four hours ago and he starts ripping terrible farts. Then the explosive diarrhea starts. In the house and outdoors. My house smells rancid. Call the vet who says he is okay and he’s just passing the wood. Our vet is a 24 hour so they had we sing by not too long ago for some probiotics and puppy pads- these won’t be too helpful as we have a year old golden who doesn’t realize he’s leaking poop.

Last year my partner and I rang in the new year on New Year’s Day at 8am with a plumbing failure. There seems to be a theme here.

809,dogs,"I (just this morning) committed to a small mixed breed dog. She’s Yorkie and Pug, and incredibly sweet. 

I wasn’t told prior that she was peeing this way. I feel like it was known, I know plenty about the house she comes from. Any time I met her it was outside and it’s wet out now, so it went unnoticed both meetings. She was wet all over her underside, but she did roll over on her back to expose her belly and I didn’t recognize it. 

Either way, I’m willing to work with it. But here’s where I’m struggling. 

She’s 6 months old, and not really house broken. I was assured that she went on a puppy pad, and was willing to work with that to get her trained to go outside instead- a pad for emergencies is fine with me. But I don’t want it to be the go-to. 

I’m willing to recognize that today was a vey intense day for her. She was picked up from a chaotic rescue (of sorts) with about 8 small dogs. She’s in a new environment without her bff chihuahua, and has witnessed a cat for the first time. From a distance, but regardless it frightened her. 

She’s also never worn a collar or a leash until today, so there’s a lot of scary new things. She came from a fenced in yard, I’m in town with a small yard and plan to walk her. 

So I’ve got a sweet, cuddly, anxious little girl and she both isn’t house broken and she is 100% submissive peeing. She doesn’t do it with me since being at her new home, but it’s likely she had prior and I missed the behavior. My neighbor came over and was excited to meet her, talked too loudly (I didn’t know until it happened) and made physical contact fairly quickly. I also had an unplanned furnace service call and she responded the same way. 

She likes contact, when you call her she comes trotting over with a wagging tail. She’s incredibly snuggly and likes affection. But if engaged too soon, she pees. What I know is that you don’t shame or punish for that, you change the environment. You slow it down and allow the dog to feel safe. 

Where I’m stuck is she hasn’t even gone on the pad at all since getting here. I’ve taken her out- the leash is distracting to her. She has not gone to the bathroom outside once today despite multiple trips outdoors. Every time it was in the house when there was extra stimulation. And it was lots of pee- not all at once, but several times per situation in very quick succession, so enough to empty her bladder. 

How do I redirect if she’s not able to control it, and doesn’t appear to know otherwise, AND may learn to do it to avoid redirecting since she isn’t house broken?

Here’s what I’m thinking about when people come to the door- I want to remove her from the situation, at least for now. Put her in her crate. But where does house training fall in that equation when she’s completely relieved her bladder inside by accident all day?

She is very treat motivated inside. She learned to sit in about 8-10 tries. (It’s not perfect, but she’s basically got it.) Right now when she’s outside she’s so overstimulated and hating the leash that they don’t even register. She just asks to be held. 

I know today was stressful for her just by circumstance. It’s possible what I’m seeing isn’t totally the case. But if it is, I want to start out right and be consistent for her. Any advice is appreciated. She sees the vet Wednesday to get her second shots, rule out any issues, and to schedule her spay appointment.",t2_2zmeek06,0,"6 month old small breed, submissive peeing and not housebroken","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,1007un9,True,phenobarbiedoll98,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1007un9/6_month_old_small_breed_submissive_peeing_and_not/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1007un9/6_month_old_small_breed_submissive_peeing_and_not/,2477203,1672533543,0,,False,1672533553,1672533554,2023-01-01 00:39:03,,,,,,
810,dogs,"I was told he's a Maltipoo (mom's Maltipoo, dad's a Maltese). I've owned a purebred maltese so I figured his personality was more like a poodle. 

Lately I'm leaning towards a Havanese, especially during his puppyhood. He has a longer body and short legs and is much sturdier than my friends toy poodle or my maltese (much like a Havanese). 

He's a shy, shy dog almost like a cat. But he's playful and smart, easy to train. He's definitely a Velcro dog and is attached to me. If I'm not around he's ok with other family members but will stare down the door.

He's quite smart, will bark, sensitive to noise. He loves praises and is a lap dog. He hates the heat and prefers the cold.

Some pictures of him with short/long hair as an adult/puppy.

Well, the dog scratched my teenage daughter while they were playing, and she decided to do something about it by giving them a quick trim. 

My daughter got her sibling to help hold down the dog, and of course there was a struggle. The first nail that was cut was cut far far too short and it became a bloody mess.

817,dogs,"Symptoms:

In the last few months, my beagle has not been himself. He wakes us up multiple times in the night to pee. This is very unusual for him, as he usually sleeps through the night. In fact, it's often a struggle to get him to venture outside in the morning when he's comfy. He's been known to hold in a pee for hours if not fond of weather or environment. Also started drinking excessive amounts of water. It's unclear what came first; excessive thirst or urination.

Breathing is heavy like he's struggling to get air in. Overheats easily. Often panting. Stomach descended (although he was a bit pudgy to begin with. But certainly not obese). Always tired. Frequently falls asleep sitting up. His eyes are bulging. He has also started eating very slowly, and much prefers soft food. (Although this may be due to dental issues. We found him with quite worn down teeth, and he's lost a few in old age). Despite the change in diet and decreased appetite, he hasn't lost weight. If anything, he's put on weight.

Current Treatment:

Vet prescribed liver tablets. Due to tablets, he is no longer waking up at night to pee excessively. But he is still drinking water excessively and has all the other above symptoms.

Dry food didn't seem to be working for him anymore, so he now gets fed half portion dry food + half portion chicken and rice. He appears happier with this.

History:

Found him as a stray about 6 years ago. Vet assumes he's now around 10+ years old. Recently picked up on an xray that he has a sort of pellet gun shrapnel lodged in his leg (Probably not relevant to diagnosis, but including anyway.) It causes him no pain, and is presumed to have been there most of his life.

Xray was for his ""knee"" joints (cruciate ligament), which he needed surgery on two years ago. He has recovered perfectly, and has no problem running around since. Still gets super excited for his walkies. He has been neutered.

My boy has had a gazillion blood tests. The vet can't seem to find anything wrong with him. Says it's not diabetes or his heart. They're not even sure if it's his liver causing the primary issues of excessive urination and thirst. Please help out. I love him dearly, and hate to think there's something that's been missed.",t2_67st5bmv,0,Help diagnose beagle.

820,dogs,"Before I begin, I have a vet appointment and training session with our dog trainer set up next week but I want to solicit some information before I go in just so that I can be completely armed with the right questions.

I have a 19 month old neutered rescue goldendoodle. He came to me with resource guarding and we’ve been making amazing progress. He’s anxious and reactive so he’s been on Prozac and generally he’s been a pretty good boy aside from the RG.

The past 6-8 weeks, he’s been showing some dog to dog aggression which he’s never shown before. This doodle LOVES dogs so it’s super out of character. They’re not like “I’m mad at you get away from me” barks or snaps, he’s legitimately starting fights with a dog with no warning or prompt. In every scenario he had been playing super well with the dog previously and had met them all before. He will have been taking a nap or settling down and will just lash out. In each case the dog was NOT engaging with him. They were just near each other. No food involved except for one instance when I was holding a treat bag (which was my bad and I should have known better). The thing is, when this happens he’s just woken up and is sort of wandering around with a glazed look on his face almost like he forgot where he was or who the dog was. The dogs he has attacked are very familiar dogs who he has played with multiple times before (male and female). There is never more than him and one other dog (more than that and he gets overwhelmed).

Another thing is some human-dog aggression. When he’s waking up and still tired he will indicate he wants pets and engagement. He will approach you or lay on you for pets. As you do, what seems like out of nowhere, he will snarl and snap. When he’s wide awake he will usually give more cues that he’s done with pets like licking his lips, showing his belly, or turning away. 

These events are happening more frequently. With 3 of the dog-to-dog events happening in the past 7 days. We are out of routine since we’re not at home for the holidays but we’ve been so good about making sure he’s getting decompression time to avoid stuff like this. Could it be that he’s just stressed? I read that adult dogs aren’t as tolerant as they were when puppies so I wonder if it’s just that or if there is some health issues at play. I was reading and I wonder if the glazed look or the perceived tiredness before the attacks are epilepsy or seizure related. Has anyone experienced this before? I will take any insight or suggestions. He’s super complex so we have a R+ trainer that we see regularly and I will explain this all to them and his vet.

821,dogs,"So I think it's general knowledge that if you have an off leash dog than it it is your responsibility to keep that dog under control and if it approaches a leashed agresssive dog and something bad happens the blame is on the first owner.

However, I have noticed that a lot of owners of reactive dogs tend to believe that they are completely in the right in any given senario simply because their dog is leashed and honestly I don't believe that.

I work in a country park that is very busy and is extremely popular with dog walkers, there are usually anywhere from 100 - 200 dogs in the area at one time. It is made up of a few large open fields surrounded by woodland trails. 

There is a man that comes twice a day and exercises his extremely dog agresssive cocker spaniel on a 15ft line in the field directly in front of the main entre. There is an incident at least once a week where a dog approaches his and very almost gets bitten, and each time he gives the same telling off to the owner - except this is a very touristy area so it is always new people and doesn't really do much to help. 

At first I completely agreed with him, but after the 8th or so incident I began to really question if he ought to be a self richous as he was about it. At what point have you stopped advocating for your dog? At what point are you also at fault?

He only went to exercise and I never saw him do any training with the dog whilst be was at the park (as in socialisation, reactivity training etc.). The spot he chose was literally the busiest in the entire park, directly in front of the main path by the car park and near the cafe. There were plenty of other spots close by that were way, way quieter. 

I know it sucks when people aren't responsible, but if I was that owner I would have realized long ago that that area was not a safe space to exercise such an agresssive dog. Honestly if there ever is an attack I would struggle to be on his side, even if technically he is in the right. Even in the hour an a half he's there a day he is usually passes by 30-40 dogs. All it takes is one mistake.

I see a lot of the time that people side with the leashed dogs owner but real life is messy, you always have to factor in other people's stupidity. Why is this any different?

We just got an email from our HOA saying we need to pay our pet fee and get proof of vaccination and we happily agreed (didn’t realize we needed to). We couldn’t find the POV so I called the shelter my boyfriend picked him up from.
 When the shelter worker looked up his file, she asked if he was neutered. I said no, and she immediately sounded upset and said we HAVE to get him neutered within 30 days or the shelter will have to come and take him back. Of course, I immediately panic at the thought of being separated from my dog whom I consider a member of my family, and who is very much attached to us. My boyfriend hears me, comes in the room, and gets on the phone with her to be told basically the same thing. He signed a contract that specified he would get the dog neutered. And so legally he has to.
My boyfriend is very much against neutering because he feels it is abusive and our dog is already very well behaved. He said that they probably won’t do anything because they’re a few hours away and so he doesn’t seem to want to do anything.

835,dogs,"Sorry, this is a bit long...

I have a 4 year old, male labradoodle. Had him since he was a puppy. My old dog walked really well for me, but not this dog. He's never been great. It's pretty situational though. We live in a suburban USA neighborhood with a yard and invisible fence. He gets some exercise and outside time, but I really want to do more walks with him. I think they're really important.

When just he and I walk, he's good for about 5 minutes or so. At that point he protests about going any further. He will turn his back on me, and sit down. No amount of waiting, coaxing, treats/chicken/cheese, or stern talking will pursuade him. As soon as I give up and turn towards home, he comes right along as if nothing happened. I haven't tried being really rough with him or dragging him. That feels wrong. I always walk him with a chest harness and a 6 foot leash. I'm pretty good about keeping him beside me instead of in front. I walk pretty fast also.

He does it when we leave on foot from our home. He also does it if we drive somewhere to walk (main street in town, or in the woods/trail). He does this on leash and off leash. Any and all weather conditions. There was a time when he was younger that he would walk well for me, but it was pretty brief. I can't remember if there was a bad experience or something that has scared him. Definitely nothing big like getting attacked/chased.

When he walks with me plus at least one other person (my kids, wife, friends, etc), he is much better. There is no protesting. It's great. However it's hard to persuade anyone to consistently walk with us (especially this time of year).

When he walks with just one other person, he is also fine. My father in law likes to walk him and they will go for miles without any problem. I've also had a dog walker once or twice to see how it would go.

Looking for any suggestions why he does this, and how to fix this. The one thing that comes to mind is this is a dog that gets way too much affection. I wonder if that has something to do with it. Maybe he knows I'm a pushover. We did do some basic training classes when he was a puppy. Stopped just short of KGC, but the instructor really liked his progress. Overall he's a decent dog. Just a couple small problems like excitability when people visit the home, and stealing socks when he has the chance. I feel like he'd be better behaved if I could walk him consistently and get his energy out. But his protests prevent me from doing this.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? No, I have lived with dogs my whole life. And as for training I'm not the most proficient but I have taught sit and lay before XD
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? I would prefer a reputable breeder, just so I can have a better understanding of my pups health
3. Describe your ideal dog. An amazing couch potato who would love to go on walks with me, and is quite lovable 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? currenlty my favorite breed would have to be an AM bully, just because of how lazy they seem to be.
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? just the normal sit, stay, and lay. With additional off the leash training 
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? Nope just a at home living dog

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? if I'm not at work or school, then I would say at the very least 3 hours. But I would always be around them playing with them

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? I would let my dog out in the yard when it wants, as well as some short walks. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? I would be willing to pay a professional, but I have no problem grooming my dogs. However I'm not to interested in long haired breeds

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for? not sure about specific sizes, but medium to large would be good

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? cant stand a whole lot of shedding, so long haired dogs are a no, but barking and slobber are fine. but would like to keep slobber to a medium 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? in a unfenced area, I would love to keep them off-leash but I prefer to not risk anything so Fenced areas are perfect

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? snuggly dog, would be the best but one that prefers some personal space is okay too.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? I'm would love an eager-to-please dog but I'm not too picky as long as their not impossible to train

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? calmly, I don't want a dog being aggressive in the bit. However I don't mind the dog barking, but defiantly don't want them rushing at the person and knocking them over 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? I would absolutely prefer not to have an aggressive dog. don't want to risk anything to happen, so puppy training is absolutely necessary 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? Not to many, I have had a wide verity of dogs. So I can handle most behaviors. Just cant have them being very aggressive 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? I would say at the VERY most 8 hours. But someone should always be with the dog so that would be rare

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? minimum grooming seems to be the biggest concern along with not barking to much

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? I have another dog, a jack Russel. And that is it.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? eventually maybe, so a nanny dog would be a very good choice

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? Don't plan on buying dog till I have more knowledge about my home in the future. but currently I plan on renting in the future

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? I live in Florida and I'm not away of any laws banning certain breeds, but I'll check once I find a breed I love

843,dogs,"I’ve been a dog lover my whole life but didn’t own one until I got my boy 3 years ago. Before him, I’d never ever judge any dog based on their breed or appearance. Every dog was the best dog to me and I’d judge them only after meeting them and think dogs were all how they’re raised.

Now I have a dog of my own who I would literally protect with my own life, and I’m knowledgeable on dog breeds and genetic, you bet I am avoiding all breeds known for dog/animal/same sex aggression. And pretty much any dog significantly larger than my dog unless I know the dog/owner already.

I mean, I don’t let me dog interact with dogs we don’t know anyway, it’s just what I’ve found best for us. But if I see a shar pei/bully breed/huge mastiff/Doberman (and I LOVE lots of these breeds) I will just walk the other direction!

I feel so mean as a huge dog lover but before a dog lover I’m a dog mum and I won’t take any gamble!

850,dogs,"Please let me start by saying I don’t condone or support backyard breeding and wholeheartedly support rescues. I have a rescue dog and he is incredible, a perfect citizen! 
Now my question is, if rescues are saving puppies from backyard breeders and puppy mills, and you go to get a puppy from said puppy mill or backyard breeder, what is the difference if you’re getting the dog vs a rescue saving the dog? Yes I understand the fact that in exchanging money, it’s a level of support, but how are rescues different if they in a sense take all the puppies or dogs away? 
What is the difference if I got a puppy, saved him or her, and then reported the facility, and contacted a rescue to save the rest? 
I know this sound idiotic, but my only gripe with rescues is that it’s nearly impossible to get a dog, and if you want a dog, you can in a sense save one from one of the bad places by getting one. 
I’ve seen rescues ask for wills, for all sorts of personal information. It seems like you have to have no pets but years of experience, make six figures, never leave your house, and have a house with an entire fenced in yard. If none of those qualifications are met, no dog.
My dog is over 80 pounds, and we’ve had three dogs on acres of non fenced in property and they were trained in where to go, never an issue.
I understand it’s for the safety of the dog, but it makes it so hard for good people to save an animals life because they don’t have a gigantic house and a massive yard.

856,dogs,"Hello all,  
I am dog sitting a small, elderly, female dog that looks like a short-haired yorkshire terrier (I'm not completely sure though). For the past few days, I've noticed that she has very short and random moments where she sort of loses balance, goes into a sitting position, and begins to twitch, as if she's about the have a seizure. I've tried to capture the moment to show her owners and vet but these moments only last for a few seconds so I'm never able to get a recording of it.   
These episode last for at most 8 seconds, and she's back to her regular self immediately after. She does not collapse onto her side, but remains in a sitting position, she doesn't foam at the mouth, her eyes do not roll nor do they look glossy, it just seems like she twitches out for a few seconds and then snaps right back out of it. These episodes seemingly happen at most once a day, but I am not sure if she has these episodes when I'm not around/when I'm asleep, so I am not aware of how frequently these episodes truly occur.  
As for her motor skills, she is able to walk, run, and jump regularly, though I tend to carry her up the stairs or onto couches because I'm still weary of the fact that she is an older dog. Her energy levels seem normal; she sometimes plays tug of war with my socks, she runs if I run, and she's always ready to bark when she hears another dog barking or a doorbell ring haha. For most of the day though, she likes to recieve pets and take naps, so she seems like a very normal and healthy dog, which is why these twitching episodes worry me so much.  
I'm not sure if this may be a neurological issue or what, but I would love to know if anyone could have any clue as to what this issue may be because Google has not been extremely helpful with this specific of a problem. Apologies for the long post, I just wanted to put as much relevant info I could. Hope this post can bring some clarity so I could relay the info to the owners and get them to take her to a vet, thanks.",t2_6k5h50qp,0,Dog randomly loses balance and twitches?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,1000yj0,True,aneonmore,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/1000yj0/dog_randomly_loses_balance_and_twitches/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1000yj0/dog_randomly_loses_balance_and_twitches/,2477091,1672512915,0,,False,1672512929,1672512929,2022-12-31 18:55:15,,,,,,

I told SPCA that the dog was a friend’s that passed away, and I took the dog in but it became too much so I decided to surrender her. 

I gave the SPCA rep my ID and they put my info into the system for the surrender and scanned her microchip.

It was 3 am and I was tired and limited on options. I don’t own a flea comb so I tried using the Furminator brush I had (since it’s fine toothed).

864,dogs,"Hi, we had a situation on our afternoon walk. We came out of a small underpass and wanted to turn right on our route as we always do. About 200m in front of us was a man with his dog coming our way. The man had a hard time controlling his dog, who was pulling on the leash, aggressively barking, lunging towards us. The man shouted in our direction, something along the lines of ""don't go this way, we've been walking for ?? kilometres already"" or something like this, hard to understand over the distance and the barking... Our dog was barking too, she's usually friendly as long as the other dog is friendly, but will bark back at dogs showing dislike towards her.

We decided to still go the way because a. the other possible way our dog would try to run to another dog who would have been walking ahead of us, b. we had our baby in the stroller and the other way would have been slightly more inconvenient to push the stroller and c. that's where we wanted to go. Our dog stopped barking once we continued walking, when we passed she was maybe 50% trying to pull towards the dog and 50% paying attention to me. The man went onto the field/grass in-between two fields when we passed and shouted ""thanks for your consideration"" at us. He struggled to control his dog and still could not continue walking but ""fighting"" his dog to kind of calm down.

895,dogs,"I grew up with a border collie until I was about 11, and my whole family and I completely love the breed. I am now 24, in a fairly flexible job (9-6, no mandatory office days and probably open to having a dog in the office) and financially secure enough to afford my own dog. I also live with my partner who owned dogs growing up and can help out with responsibilities. The thing is, there is really no other dog breed that I am as enamored with as BCs but we live in a 1-bed apartment in London and I worry about this being unfair to the dog. 

On one hand, we have a shared garden out back as well as lots of parks and wetlands nearby (e.g. Richmond Park, Putney Riverside) so we could easily ensure we meet their exercise needs. We're also both keen on training the dog and finding fun toys and other ways of providing mental stimulation. If needed, my parents have already said they'd be more than happy to care for the dog whilst we're abroad or come up for the day to look after it, and we have live near friends who could also help out. Finally, we will hopefully be moving back to Edinburgh in the next 3-4 years where we can afford a house or much bigger apartment with private garden so the small space won't be a long-term issue.

However, I'm sure there will be occasional days when both my partner and I have to be in the office with no one to check in on the pup. If we are still able to walk the dog in the morning and evening, would it be cruel for them to be in a 1-bed place for that time? How likely would it be for the dog to become destructive in that environment? I'd happily find a local dog walker or doggy daycare, but it seems quite expensive in our area so I don't want to rely on that option in case our financial situation changes.

As a pet parent myself, I often wonder what if there is an app that provides: 

1. Graphs that track the progression of your dog’s reactivity to each trigger, and get personalised advice accordingly (you can add activities and reminders to your day like walking, training, etc.);

2. A GPS enabled navigation guide to: identify less crowded places and walking routes (with least amount of triggers) to take your dog(s).

3. A community to interact with fellow reactive dog owners, share experiences and learn from each other and also find groomers, walkers, sitters that are experienced in handling reactive dogs.

Would you be willing to pay for such a service? (Please be as honest as possible).

902,dogs,"Just a pet (haha) peeve of mine I need to vent about. 

I have an assistance dog. He comes to school with me, a school which is one to one learning with a teacher. As such, even the most basic tasks, like just giving him a drink, often prompts comments about how I'm his 'mum' or 'mummy' from a few specific people. One teacher in particular, who I thankfully won't have in January, did this constantly, speaking 'for' my dog as well and generally viewing herself as the Dog Goddess because she got a puppy a few months back and that obviously makes her more knowledgeable than people who've owned dogs for years.

I am not female. I am not comfortable with female terms. I don't plan to be called 'mummy' by my own kids, let alone my dog. 

Fine if others want to view themselves as dog parents and call themselves mummy/daddy/whatever, but I really don't think it should be assumed that EVERYONE does (especially when that person doesn't use gendered terms!). My dog is my equal, I take care of him and he takes care of me, I am not his parent and he is not my child. He is a dog. 

It just feels to me like people now think just 'dog' or just 'pet' aren't enough titles of love, and the dog has to be a 'fur baby' instead, because calling a spade a spade is somehow insulting? Or means you don't love them as much?

I got my first ever puppy home 2 days ago and is a beautiful Golden retriever.

Questions:
Sometimes he finishes the food, sometimes eats and plays around and comes back, sometimes doesn't seem interested at all. Is this normal?

He isn't very energetic, I know puppies sleep a lot but even when he's awake and going he would rather lie down next to me than run around.

I'm finding pooping schedule a bit tough to track down any tips?

He doesn't seem interest at all in his crate and would rather sleep in the tent I set up in his playpen is this ok or should I emphasize crate sleeping?

Is there a deoderizer that you recommend for the house to remove scent which is safe for dogs?

Should I start brushing his teeth right now? I bought dentasticks but closer examining the instructions, it seems he isn't big enough yet.

Did you keep water for your puppy all night?

Any other tips you could provide? He has his own double sized playpen with 3 beds, a fake grass potty mat (which he took to instantly when not outdoors), crate and a bunch of toys.

Around 3 ish days into the trip I got a call from them that said that he had started coughing and that kennel cough is spreading in our area, so it could be that. I took him to a vet after picking him up and it did indeed turn out to be kennel cough. The vet said it isn’t too serious, gave me some meds and said to make sure he keeps eating, which is exactly what he isn’t doing. It’s been 3 days or maybe even more since he’s touched even a morsel of food, I’ve tried everything, wet food, dry food, tried giving him chicken broth like the vet suggested but he refuses to even sniff it. He won’t even eat the treats that he used to go crazy for before. I doubt he ate much at boarding either with how much skinnier he’s come back, so I don’t even know how long it’s been since he hasn’t been eating. I’m so scared now and completely at my wits end and don’t know what to do at this point.

915,dogs,"15 year old GSD is starting to show signs of dementia. She has a stroke a couple years ago and has been getting worse since.

She generally sleeps all day and isn't in pain or aggressive. But at night she whines and barks at seemingly nothing. We let her out incase she has to go potty but she gets confused and just walks back in.

Recently she's seemed really uncomfortable at night but with no real indication of what it is. We took her to the vet and nothing is physically wrong besides arthritis. It's heartbreaking seeing how upset she is at nothing. 

She's also been spending a lot of time just licking the floor, or walls, getting stuck behind furnature, and doesn't seem to recognize her name anymore.

How do you make the judgment to euthanize (we almost did when she had her stroke but waited and glad we did) but it seems like over the last couple months she's been spending more time distressed than happy.

Whenever we all go on trips he loves them, licks them, leans on them, looks at them while we walk all together, he even sleeps on their bed. But whenever they are staying at my house (I live alone with my dog), he is always attached to me, he shows signs of being uncomfortable when they pet him, he doesn’t even seem to be after their affection. When I say uncomfortable I mean, whale eyes, licks his lips, slightly shows teeth. (It doesn’t help that my mom, being Greek she’s very animated with her hands and her voice goes up and down while talking.) If 10mins later we go in the car and he sits in the back with my mom, he’s all over her, laying on her, sleeping on her, everything. 

I thought we were past that but he’s still being possessive of me at home. My parents love him and they don’t see the signs I see, it’s a bit sad cause they adore him for making me happy and I really wish he was loving towards them not only when we’re on vacation but also when we’re at home. I’m also seeing signs of him trying to be “dominant” towards my mom, an hour ago she was sitting on a lounge seat that normally (when it’s me and him) he sits there, he went towards her, stood on his rear two legs and leaning his arms on her. She was giggling and she thought he wanted her affection, I think he wanted her to get off his seat. I can see why he’s being possessive of me and likely the whole house but I wish he’d accept them at this point.

920,dogs,"Howdy folks!  My girlfriend is a wonderful pet parent to a minpin/chihuahua mix.  He’s an older pup, about 11 or 12, and while he’s starting to experience the ailments that accompany old age, he remains in generally good health according to the vet.

However, he appears to be suffering from anxiety that gets increasingly worse with age.  According to my gf, he does nothing but stare at her, whine and shiver when she’s home with him.  She provides him with lots of attention and gives him plenty of walks, but he is utterly incapable of relaxing.  The whining is typically accompanied by suggestive glances to the kitchen.  He is particularly food driven, but he is fed an appropriate amount and my gf does her best not to give in to the constant begging by providing extraneous treats.

She used to be able to pacify the pup with a bully stick, but he is unwilling to chew harder objects these days thanks to those old age issues - he’s had some problems with his teeth as well as his neck.  Anything softer that we could get for him to chew on will be swiftly eaten, defeating the purpose.

She’s tried lots of things to try to calm him.  CBD oil does almost nothing.  Giving in by feeding him more doesn’t stop the behavior.  She loves her pup dearly and just wants him to be comfortable and able to relax - for both their sakes - but she can’t find any way to make that happen.

922,dogs,"I thought this might be interesting to share because I don’t think the general public really knows what goes on in the rescue world. I didn’t know until I started to work with and become a board member of a rescue and began learning from my mentor. 

This isn’t to shame anyone for getting your dog wherever you did - one of my dogs came from an irresponsible rescue that did everything wrong (including allowing his litter to be produced on their watch and doing zero vetting for adopters). BUT if you have an opportunity to vote with your dollars going forward, I really recommend choosing a responsible rescue! 

Irresponsible Rescue:
1. Does not vet adopters or do reference checks (vet and personal) or home checks to ensure a high level of commitment, safe environment and a good history with animals.
2. Does not include contracts to ensure spay/neuter and vaccination at an appropriate age to prevent more unwanted litters and illness.
3. Does not take back dogs that are a poor fit for whatever reason.
4. Lies about behavior issues, medical issues and temperament (you would not believe how much this happens)
5. Encourages outdated training methods and allows traumatized dogs to be “trained” by compulsion based trainers. Outdated beliefs about pack theory and dominance are extremely common in the rescue world. Many rescues are sponsored by balanced/compulsion based training franchises.
6. No behavior or training support after adoption.

Responsible Rescue:
1. Ensures safe and appropriate homes by interviewing adopters to find a good fit, checking personal and vet references and doing home checks. Dog hoarding is more common than you think.
2. Includes contracts to ensure age appropriate spay/neuter and vaccinations to prevent illness and future litters.
3. Provides all medical treatment possible prior to adoption for existing health problems.
4. Takes dogs back for any reason. 
5. Honestly communicates a dogs history, needs, temperament and any challenges.
6. Provides ongoing behavior support using force free ethical methods.

You’re putting money in someone’s pocket that allows them to keep doing what they’re doing. I adore my dog and wouldn’t go back, but I wish I could have given money to a rescue that really took good care of the animals they’re rehoming instead of supporting a shady operation.

Thing is, she has some neuroatypical issues that make driving her there so incredibly stressful for her.

It went really great until he ended up having leash reactivity, I cried so  many nights trying to help him get through it, the videos were so unrealistic about how long progress can take…I ended up rehoming him not knowing it was supposed to take super long. I just thought it was genetic and couldn’t be fixed. He’s with a really sweet family now so I guess it’s bittersweet. I want to adopt another dog but I seriously can’t stop getting anxiety when I foster a dog. I’m guessing it’s because I think of all the training and care and commitment?

I took him for like 5 to 6 miles of walks today and separated them, tried to put him in his kennel which he sleeps in voluntarily, with a chew stick and he barks non stop, threw his ball for him for an hour straight. Tried holding him while my dog sniffed around him and he got more wild.

I took her to the vet to create a diet plan since she is 12.5 years old and wanted to make sure I was doing it right.  The vet found the extra weight on her stomach was fluid and she had actually lost some weight.  We could feel her spine more easily, etc.

She hasn't been officially diagnosed yet since we are waiting until tomorrow for test results to come back.  But the xrays showed a large mass growing and her liver had shifted a lot.  The vet is pretty confident it is lymphoma.  This shocked me since I brought her in for a diet plan and now I am finding out she is going to have to be put down sometime soon.  She has been behaving 100% normally minus the rounder belly.  The vet said the steroid treatment + pills to lessen the fluid could buy her anywhere from 6-12 months at the very best.  I do not want to put her through chemo and plan on spending as much time having fun with her as possible.

I started measuring his water intake a few days ago, before that i'd just fill his bowl when noticing it was empty. He can go through 4L in a day. Probably less since he does spill a massive amount on the floor (he tries to run away with the water in his mouth..) but still.  


During events he would sometimes drink in those cat water bowls that fills themselves from a tank. On Christmas he peed twice on the floor without really any warning. Granted I didn't have full focus on him, I might have missed them, but still.

950,dogs,"My parents know somebody who needs to rehome a basset hound puppy (less than 1yr).  They know I've been looking for another dog and offered to pick her up for me if I want her.  I've never really looked into bassets as a breed so I'm doing a ton of research now, but I figured I would ask here for some human opinions as well.

&amp;#x200B;
**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No.  I've grown up with dogs my whole life, and currently own one. Some of my dogs were rescued as adults and some purchased as puppies, so I've run the gamut on training and care from puppy to end of life.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Not really relevant here.  I've been keeping an eye on local shelters, but this dog is being privately rehomed.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Small to medium size (under 50lbs), good with living in a small space (apartment), but with moderate energy for walks/play. A more friendly disposition towards both dogs and people would be great, but this doesn't exactly need to be a super ""nanny""/""family"" type dog (no kids, don't want those!).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* TBH if I were to buy from a breeder of choice I'd get a Keeshond, but that's not relevant to this situation.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience, maybe some fun tricks or puzzle games if the dog enjoys mental stimulation. I'm looking for a companion, not a working dog.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* See above.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I know that ""as much as the dog needs"" sounds like a bad answer, but I have a hard time putting a time limit on it.  I do want a dog I can have ""down time"" with that doesn't need CONSTANT stimulation (obviously this will be less so while the dog is still a puppy), but multiple walks, lots of playtime, consistent training, etc. are all part of the package and those things sort of spread throughout the day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* My apartment does have a fenced-in dog park as well as a public park with a walking trail across the street, so we have options for exercise.  I work from home so frequent smaller potty breaks or just attention breaks to get me away from my desk are normal. With no commute I have time for long walks.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* My current dog is a Pekingese. I am no stranger to at-home grooming between professional appointments.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I'm armed with a roomba for shedding.  Slobber is...eh, but I can deal. Barking is my biggest worry with this dog. I know hounds are very vocal and even though I work from home which is good to reduce separation anxiety and anti-bark training, I DO still live in an apartment so I'm really weary about that. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Never in an unfenced area.  Good recall for if I drop the leash or something, but I don't plan to have my dog regularly off leash in an unfenced area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm middle of the road on this one. Affectionate, but not neurotically in need of attention.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I feel like this is the same as the above question? 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A warning bark for the door and keeping distance at first are fine, as long as they stop once they know there isn't a threat at the door. For greeting people sans door no aggression.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. Full stop. Mostly because I have another dog myself, but also because I have family and friends with dogs we socialize together.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* The above mentioned aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Just to run errands and go out for fun, no more than a few hours at a time.  Like I said, I work from home, so the biggest chunk of time most people are gone I'm home for.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No other humans here. I'm single and live with no roommates.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* My other dog is a Pekingese.  I don't know how old she is (got her from a shelter), but I've had her for 6 and a half years and she doesn't have grey face or any other signs of aging so I'd put her between 8-10 years old.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent.  No breed or weight restrictions where I am now. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Urban Florida, USA. No laws that I'm aware of. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is in the mid/upper 90's, winter is usually 70's/80's during the day unless we have a cold front.  Almost all houses and apartments here have central air, and I keep mine set to 72F all the time. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

He had some rough separation anxiety at first, which makes sense, but we got through it.  He calmed down significantly after we had our son 5 years ago and has never had any other behavior issues.

My husband has always been his favorite since he took over most dog care while I was pregnant and in the first few months of my son's life.  But he was always perfectly happy around me, too, he just preferred Dad.  About 6 months ago, he stopped sleeping on our bed, preferring to walk out to the living room and sleep on the couch.  We thought it was weird, but he's getting old and going a bit deaf, so it wasn't a big deal.

Then at Thanksgiving, we left him with a sitter for a few days while we visited some family.  It was a new sitter, but he seemed perfectly fine there and when we picked him up.  But when he got home, suddenly he was actively avoiding me.  No major concerning fear behaviors (like aggression, barking, crying), but if I come in the room and sit down, he will get up and leave.  If I try to call him over, he'll look at me and either walk away or not move.  He'll come in where his water dish is, see that I'm in the room, then turn and leave.  As far as I can tell, I haven't made any significant changes to my behavior towards him, and I also took a pregnancy test to make sure he wasn't sensing some change to my smell or something (it was negative, so not that).  We're really not sure what sparked this sudden change.

The one thing the vet noticed was that he had lost a pound (he's been 20 lbs his whole life) and suspected his old anxiety might be coming back in his old age.  We started him on an anti-anxiety med which seems to be working in that he shakes less and doesn't *look* as scared when he looks at me, but he still avoids me.

Any advice on anything I can do to help him feel comfortable with me again?  I don't want him to be so stressed in his home, and I miss snuggling my little guy :(",t2_ej81s,0,Our dog we've had for 8 years is suddenly afraid of me,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zzh759,True,scarletmuse12,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zzh759/our_dog_weve_had_for_8_years_is_suddenly_afraid/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zzh759/our_dog_weve_had_for_8_years_is_suddenly_afraid/,2476835,1672448839,0,,False,1672448850,1672448850,2022-12-31 01:07:19,,,,,,

960,dogs,"[it sounds like this, not my video](https://youtube.com/shorts/s69SUGCs_AI?feature=share) its very, very loud as if it’s being played on a small speaker. 

My dog is usually uncomfortable and won’t eat. The gurgling noises do stop after a couple hours and most usually happens when he first wakes up / in the beginning of the day. It has never happened where it starts mid day or night time *unless I did not notice*. He has normal bowel movements: before, during, and after these episodes.

After skipping breakfast, he is usually eager and ready to eat dinner - of which this is a BLAND homemade chicken and rice porridge with only chicken, rice and water. 

This has happened 2 or 3 times in the last 1.5 years I’ve had my dog. Is this considered often? The symptoms only last for half a day~ and he is eating by dinner time. 

I really don’t know what could have caused his upset stomach in terms of food. He does get a lot of different foods throughout the day for enrichment and training, so it really is hard to pinpoint it to anything specific but I have a list of items he had previously. The weird thing is, if it WAS GI: wouldn’t he have diarrhea or mucus stool? Why is his stool extremely healthy in firmness, color and consistency/ shape? Including day of/ during the gurgling episode?

It almost makes me feel concerned it could be more serious than eating something bad especially with it happening 2-3x since I’ve had my dog. He is almost 2 years old.  

I tried calling my vet but they closed at noon today, and I didn’t feel like it warranted an emergency visit. Especially because I had gone through this.

975,dogs,"Hi there friends.

My 13 year old Cava-Tzu has recently been diagnosed with a very aggressive type of pancreatic cancer that has already spread to his liver.  We’ve decided to not try to treat it, as the prognosis isn’t very good, and I don’t want to put him through so much when we might only gain a week or two.

Since getting the diagnosis, he has gone downhill as far as energy and hunger.  We have pain meds, anti-nausea meds, and even an appetite stimulant we give him every day.  The most we can get him to eat is a small bite of chicken once a day.  He’s still drinking a lot of water, but doesn’t keep it down very well.

His day has become 95% sleeping, with a little bit of throwing up or going potty here and there.  We’ve been keeping up on his pain meds, and he doesn’t seem in obvious pain, but we’re at the point of wondering, is this worth it?  Should we start considering the final option?

I would love to hear your advice and stories as if you’ve gone through something similar.  He is my fur baby, and was my first “child” before having my human children, so I am struggling to see him so lethargic.  He has so much of my heart.

976,dogs,"Hi all, I'm hoping for some outside/objective perspective on our neighbor's dog who barks all day every day.  

TLDR: Dog is left out at an apartment porch nearly all day, every day and barks non-stop. This has been going on for a month since they've moved in. Is this something I should approach the neighbor about?  

I live in an apartment complex and work from home. Our neighbor moved in 1 month ago with their husky. When they moved in, I heard their dog bark everyday from morning to sunset. This includes some weekends. About a week after they moved in, they started putting their dog out on the porch during the day. The dog still barks nonstop out on the porch.  

I suspect the dog has to be left at home when the guardians go to work. The dog seems to have very bad separation anxiety (you can kinda hear the desperation in her bark).  

I'm thinking of leaving an anonymous note, saying something to the effect of: I'm not sure if you know, but your dog has very bad separation anxiety and barks all day.  

What do you all think? I didn't mind too much at first because I work with headphones on most of the time and our dog, Hodu, isn't too affected by all the barking (he doesn't love it but he can sleep through it). It was a little hard to hear the desperate barks all day, but I kinda just trusted that they were gonna work on it. I'm getting annoyed because they just kicked the dog out onto the porch. I'd like to approach them in person, but in the \~10 times we've seen each other, they've hurried away before I could introduce myself. I just don't want to overreact since I don't know all the facts and I don't want them to re-home the dog.

978,dogs,"I had a newborn baby this past weekend. I have two dogs. One is a 15lb American Eskimo that has resourced guarded his entire life. We’ve had him since he was 8 weeks old and we love him very much. He’s 6 years old and probably has 5 bites under his belt (two when he was under a year old, I had no idea how to manage him back then) — they were all single bites that he retreated from, and they were all shallow. But that doesn’t mean they don’t hurt.

He is generally an anxious dog. He’s extremely well trained and smart, but you can’t undo his resource guarding.  In addition to food, he protects areas of the house. Under a table, a chair, etc.

My wife and I can handle his behavior well. We work around him, distract him when we need to get him away from something he’s guarding, etc. We know his signs and his behavior very well. But we are always on guard to make sure nothing happens.

I don’t even know what I’m trying to ask here. I am a new dad by 5 days. I am trying to think of whether it will be feasible to keep him once the baby starts moving. I am also trying to understand if it would even be possible to rehome him if we wanted to, or if a shelter would even take him. If he’s being rehomed he shouldn’t be with kids or dogs.

When I got him he was always a bit iffy of the outside world but there was places he was most comfortable and places he would tolerate and places he would hate. I dont know why he hated some places (it was in town he hated he only likes a few places that dont give him enough exercise or new places to sniff) maybe something triggered him and he hated it since, I still dont know. He was alright up until October when he turned 5 months and he started to get REALLY scared of everything, this includes but is not limited to; people, dogs, loud noises, windows, flags, down town, manaquins, shops where they have large windows, people again because i can not emphasis enough how much he hates people other than a handful, men standing outside pubs, cars, buses and more that im probably forgetting. Nearly everything triggers him hes always on alert. He was never like this for the 2 months I first had him, We went to training classes, down town when he tolerated it, the park and many other places. Something just clicked in him when he turned 5 months and it kills me that I dont know why.

The place I live mostly consists of town (which is is very afraid of) he needs exercise so sometimes i have to take him down there. As soon as we step foot off of the street I live on he goes mental, belly on the ground pulling, sometimes whimpers, barking at people across the road, tail between the legs and always on alert. I cant bring him anywhere anymore without him having a freak out, he enjoys the small car park thats near my house and the small local graveyard near my house as well as the church near my house but thats it and even then if someone also happens to pass through one of them places he bark and lunges at them out of fear. Hes only ever happy when hes in one of them 3 places ALONE with me. I dont know what to do with him, I have blisters all over my hands from his leash pulling down town, im mentally exhausted.

His solution is to keep them sequestered in the kitchen nearly all day long. They have little to no human interaction and the interaction they do have is neglectful or aggressive. They are never groomed, have very little training, and I don’t even know if they are up to date on their vaccinations. 

He often leaves the country and leaves the dogs with my sibling who is in college and does not have the time nor the desire to care for the dogs. They end up relieving themselves indoors in their care. I tried to find a boarding farm with acreage for them to run around but they are not spayed. I would take them if I could but I already have 1 dog and do not have room for such big dogs. Nor the time to train them. 

I have booked them grooming appointments and am taking the dogs for the week while my father is out of town but I am looking for long term solutions. I went no contact with my father years ago but cannot continue to do nothing while these dogs are being abused. I am located in the US. He technically shelters and feeds them so there won’t be consequences if I report him.

I have a 2 year old male Beagle. He has always been picky with food. It was because we initially spoiled him with treats. 

Someone has to literally sit down with him and put some treats jn his food for him to eat it.

But recently, he has been eating nothing. He is acting okay, playing a lot, drinking water, sleeping well, pooping well. 

Vet said he is okay. Probably not eating because of the cold weather (his default reply to everything) some background- i live in a small town so there is just the 1 vet here who is also not the best. There is no blood test/xray facility here for dogs. 

Idk what to do. He eats chicken once a week but he has been rejecting that too. Some treats he will eat, some he will reject. Its been 2 days since he ate something.

There has been no response. 

We live in a studio behind my parent's home (main house). My parents have two small dogs (10-15lbs) and they always have their grandchildren over. Their grandparents, what do you expect 😉

Below is the info I received regarding the adorable pup. However, I have two questions.

From the information below, how do I 

A) Test to see how the pup does with small kids 

B) How the pup does with small dogs 


From the Lady that found the pup
  ""I honestly do not know for sure how he is with small dogs &amp; small children. My teenager and I took him to the BA dog park and he was super excited/friendly with a smaller terrier mix (20lbs-ish) through the fence &amp; we avoided the big dog area because one of the other bigger dogs was being a bit aggressive toward him &amp; I just wasn't 100% sure how he would track if the other dog got too pushy. 

He was trying to hide behind my legs before we left that area and went walking outside the smaller dog area - that's when he was being friendly through the fence. 

He's your typical 8-10 month puppy: goofy, a bit more to grow kind of clumsy. He's a lover for sure - total sucker for a belly rub and wants nothing more than to be touching you. 

He takes treats softly &amp; walks well on a leash (with that typical puppy need for a reminder to not pull).  He sits, and we are working on not pawing to say hello when he gets excited - he's pretty smart and has figured out that if I turn my back &amp; he sits instead of jumps, he gets some scratches &amp; a belly rub.""

For example, my dog is currently playing with a new kong with a treat in it. When she walked away from it, my brother’s dog started moving toward it. Immediately, our dog growled/snarled in what *sounded* aggressive but never involves actual biting or fighting. 

Is this a behavior we should try to correct? Because in some respects I understand where she is coming from. But it sounds much worse than it is and can unsettle others that are around.

995,dogs,"Hey all. So my fiancée is close to 3 months pregnant. We’re super excited to have a kid together. But she dropped the most random bomb on me the other day- she wants to get rid of our dogs because she can’t handle the stress from two dogs and a child. Let’s talk about our dogs… Our oldest is a 3.5 year old German Wirehaired Pointer. I’ve had him since he was 8 weeks old, and have owned him before I even met fiancée. He’s the best dog ever. Super friendly, goofy, cute, you name it. He’s a great dog. He’s pretty hyper but it’s a hyper breed. Now the other dog. He’s about a year and a half, he’s a Mini Aussie/Border Collie mix. He’s a great dog as well. He’s a terrible attention whore. He loves attention and won’t stop at anything to get it! They both do have their quirks, but what dog doesn’t? Winston (3.5 year old) is super hyper and spins and spins and spins when he’s about to go outside. He has scratched up our wall next to the front door and a little bit of the trim as well. I am getting it fixed this week and am going to work with him on being calm before we go outside. Whiskey (the little one) chews on everything if given the chance! He has chewed up our coffee table, some of our trim (he was a young puppy), and you can’t leave napkins or paper laying around, or else he WILL get to it. He actually chewed up a title to my truck once. True story.

Anywho. I recently got a new job which starts at 5:30am. Playing with them in the morning is a little harder now because of it, which is an unfair change to them because they are used to fetch and playing outside every morning before work. They also play for at least 15 minutes minimum after work. I wear them out. So they aren’t neglected by any means. Well the fiancée works from home more often than not, and just yesterday Winston started crying in his kennel. She freaked out over it and that’s when she told me “he isn’t happy, you should find him a new home.” This came as a huge surprise to me because we’ve always talked about how good the dogs would to our kids. She is now giving me the ultimatum. It’s her or the dogs. I find this super unfair to them, especially since they aren’t neglected by any means. If we were married I think it would be a different story because no man should ever choose a dog over his wife and kids. But alas, we aren’t married and to be honest we’ve been having a terribly unhealthy relationship for months now. She even threw her ring last night and broke it. So yeah not sure this would even last anyways, dogs or no dogs in the picture.

Has anybody else dealt with something similar? I want to speak to a therapist or some sort of professional because this whole thing is hurting my head. Any advice or kind words would be be much appreciated. Thank you.",t2_17dkdd,0,Pregnant fiancée wants to get rid of both dogs.

997,dogs,"Maybe it’s just the dog breeding, the way I raised him or both but my dog is determined to be by my side 24/7 every time I’m home. I can’t go anywhere without him following me or needing to be next to me, when I do leave him out the room he’ll go bark at someone else, wait near the door or go tear something up.

I just want to be able to have my space for a few hours or so when I come home from work to wind down then interact fully with him. For achieving this, Is it as easy as just leaving him out the room and letting him unattach home self?
