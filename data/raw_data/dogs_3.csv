3,dogs,"My best boy is gone. I am truly lost. He developed a cough around Thanksgiving so we went to the vet. Bloodwork and x-rays revealed weakening heart muscles. I was told this was normal in older dogs (he was 11). Fast forward to December 22 and we take him in for his checkup. He was coughing terribly in the vets office but she didn't do follow up x-rays. She did do bloodwork and it came back fine. We came home with 4 bottles of medicine. 2 hours later, we're back at the vet because Baxter couldn't breathe without choking and throwing up. The vet gave him 2 shots, one of which she said would make him have to pee. He needed to pee about 20 minutes later so I took him outside. He kept trying to get away from me, which was very unlike him. I picked him up and carried him back to the room. I got in the floor with him and told him how much I loved him. I thanked him for 11 years of unconditional love from him. I held his face and told him that I couldn't stand to see him suffer. I told him that if he needed to go, that as much as I hated it, I understood because I didn't want him in pain. I went across the hall to pee and left Baxter in the room with my mom. I was gone maybe 2.5 minutes. (Bathroom is directly across the hall from the room he was in.) I opened the bathroom door and mom was kind of blocking the door to the room. She said, ""he's laying right behind the door and I didn't want you to hit his paws."" I squeezed in the door, my sweet boy looked up at me, took a deep breath...and died. Right in front of me. I don't really remember anything after that other than sliding down the wall and screaming. 
It's been 8 days. 8 very quiet days. No clicking nails, no barks when the ups man comes. Just silence. And tears. So many tears. I have never had an animal this long. I had no idea how much I would love him. And I have no idea when or if this pain will ever end.

8,dogs,"My dog doesn‚Äôt like fetch. I throw something and 90% he just looks at me like ‚ÄúYea I‚Äôm not expending the energy to go get that‚Äù. 10% of the time he will go grab it but he won‚Äôt bring it back. He either wanders off with it or drops it after carrying it back to me only a few feet. 

I‚Äôve tried kind of successfully to train ‚Äúbring it here‚Äù. Where he gets a treat for bringing to toy back. Unfortunately half the time he thinks he doesn‚Äôt have to actually bring the toy back and comes back to me empty handed (empty mouthed?) for a treat. He is highly food motivated but doesn‚Äôt really care for toys. 

But I really want to teach him to play fetch. And play fetch enthusiastically. Not his current sort of lazy plodding to maybe go pick up a toy if he feels like it.

I found a video that married treats to toys. Having a treat in a toy to spark interest. Unfortunately my dog is a resource guarded and one step of this training is to have the dog bring back the treat laden toy to the owner and the owner takes the toy and takes the treat out to reward the dog.

9,dogs,"My dog is some kind of westie mix, 15 pounds, about 1 year. He is my first dog, so I don't know if this sort of thing is common. When running around off-leash, he will sometimes lift one leg (usually a back leg) and speed-hop on three limbs. He doesn't appear to be in any pain nor do I ever find anything in his paw when he does this, and he always goes back to normal after about 30 seconds.

I asked the vet about this during a (hopefully) unrelated visit about him suddenly being in pain with swelling around his hip (x-ray + blood came back normal and he gradually healed over the course of a week). The vet says that dogs sometimes luxate their knees while running, so they hop around a bit until it goes back in. Now, I only have two legs, but quite frankly I don't randomly dislocate one of my knees when I run about. So I am worried this might be a bit more serious than she's letting on.

* My dog would go after my old cat. That is most likely because he came into her territory without being properly introduced. My cat hated my dog going in and eventually became an outside cat due to peeing, due to dog cornering cat upstairs.
* My dog is a dog with a strong prey instinct against squirrels.
* Here's where it gets weird though. My dog has gotten along with some other cats in the past. We have a picture of him cuddling with our pet-sitters cat. He goes after some cats and loves others.
* My dog is pretty well collar trained and would probably listen if he's going after the cat

19,dogs,"I‚Äôm presently sitting in an ER parking lot looking towards a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill and distress of my dog due to a relative allowing my 10 year old staffie/shepherd mix to chew the cartilage ends off a slow cooked lamb bone while we attended a family get together. They were insistent they took it away after the ends were gone and only the bone remained but had I been aware of what was happening I never would‚Äôve allowed it in the first place.

After he ate the bone on Saturday night he was able to defecate that night and the next morning but by Sunday mid-day he was straining and producing nothing. This continued for another day until we took him to an urgent care vet who did an abdominal X-ray to confirm constipation, an enema to try and rehydrate the stool, and stool softeners to try and promote movement. Even after all this he was still unproductive and straining 2 days later which prompted an ER visit to a better equipped pet hospital on Thursday morning as I knew something was significantly not right - particularly as he did not want to eat anything and was vomiting anything he did. 

They had been trying the same strategy of serial enemas, stool softeners, and what little  manual manipulation digitally my dog would permit (apparently he did not like too much of this - and who would?). Still straining after an overnight hospital stay so at this point he has to be put under general anesthesia so they can manually remove the blockage sitting just a mere 2‚Äù in from his rectum.

The reason this occurred is due to crushed up bone fragments combining with waste matter to create an amalgamation of an almost concrete like fecal mass that he absolutely could not evacuate. Even though small chunks would break off not enough was happening. I even felt one of these chunks and it‚Äôs like a dried out hard calcitic feeling substance - almost coral-like in consistency but not as hard. It‚Äôs able to be broken up with fingers while immersed in water but harder small bits of bone are revealed after the other material dissolves.

34,dogs,"I have an 18 month old American Bulldog puppy, Agatha Trunchbull, or Trunchie.  She's my second American Bulldog.  My first was Athena.  I bought them both from breeders, though different breeders.  My first dog was a dream.  I understood she was a high energy breed, so we went on long walks and played lots of games.  I understood that a tired dog was a good dog, and understood that any behavior issues were my fault.  When she misbehaved, it was 100% of the time because I neglected to get her the exercise she needed.  I noticed at about 9 months and again at about 18 months dramatic improvements in her behavior, and from 18 months she was a calm, intelligent, trainable dog unless she went two days in a row without enough exercise.

With Trunchie, all these rules seem to have flown out the window.  I'm fortunate to be self employed and work from home, so I've been able to dedicate my life to both dogs in their puppy stages in a similar fashion.  I honestly think there's something wrong with her brain.  There is no level of exercise that will get her to be calm.  You can get a slight improvement from up to four miles of running, but if you push past it, she gets too tired, and her self control suffers even more.  She's careless and thoughtless about the world around her.  Being a catch dog, she has an instinct to go for ears.  She kept nibbling my ears, not too hard, but enough to make me yell.  Over and over and over again, you can yell as much as you want, she knows she hurt your ears, she doesn't care.  I finally tried biting her ears.  The first time I did it, she cried out with such shock and indignation.  How dare I cause her pain!!!!!  But she kept biting mine too.  I bit back, harder each time, and on the third bite, she learned.  She has not bit my ears since.

Another thing she used to do is lift her head up with all of her strength and skull smash my jaw up into my teeth.  I have permanent damage to my jaw from it happening so many times.  Much like the ears, the only way I was able to get it to stop was by doing the same thing to my dog.  It sounds brutal.  It is.  I hate it.  I love dogs.  It worked.  She stopped.  She hasn't skull smashed my jaw in months.  I don't know what to do.  I hate violence.  Out of desperation I have extended this method to other ways that she causes pain and now I have a dog who thinks when I trip and stumble her direction it's a punishment.  I'm sorry Agatha, I love you deeply, I don't want to hurt you, but I can't keep letting you destroy my body either.  I don't understand how she's so sensitive towards and terrified of any kind of physical correction, but yet takes great delight in causing pain and agony to everyone else.  She is on some level capable of making the connection, as demonstrated by the fact that she no longer skull smashes my jaw or bites my ears.  So why cannot that connection be generalized?

I have friends who hate her, who won't come over anymore, because she beats them up.  She beats me up too, and I hate it.  I'm 33 but I have autoimmune disease and I can't be having a dog beat me up.  She doesn't do it on purpose.  In fact, she's an extremely friendly and good-natured dog, which makes it that much harder.  A therapy dog evaluator that I bumped into by chance told me that I just had to get her certified, as she could tell by the way she looked at each person who walked by with adoration that she had the personality.  I agree, she is a giant bundle of love.  But if she can't understand that her actions cause people pain, she will never be a therapy dog.

She has less than zero chill.  She understands on some level now that I don't like getting beat up, but she can't help herself.  We'll be playing a game, having fun, then all of a sudden she tackles me and tramples me, or punches me right in the guts or the mouth.  She knows right away she messed up.  I almost don't even get mad anymore, because she knows.  I yell ow!! by instinct, I glare at her, she slinks away all apologetic.  Why do you keep beating people up if you know it's bad, you know we hate it, you know it makes play time stop?

The worst part is, I know that she does have self control that she can use if she wants.  There are other behaviors that don't cause pain that she struggles with as well.  She knows I don't want her to eat turds off the ground, go greet the mail delivery, so on and so forth.  Those behaviors can be stopped with a shock collar.  I don't even have to use it.  I've only pushed the button a few times.  If the collar is on, all of a sudden, the behavior magically is perfect.  She'll watch the mail come and go without moving an inch, if the collar is on.  It doesn't work for beating people up during play time, because when she's that excited, nothing in her brain works.  But it works for regular excitement.  The most frustrating thing is, she is an incredibly intelligent dog.  She's smarter than my last dog, who I swear spoke English. I taught Trunchie to turn in a circle in like three tries.  She's smart as a whip.  So WHY OH WHY can she not use this intelligence to stop causing pain to people she loves, doing actions that she KNOWS are bad?

Are some dogs just born with broken brains?  Is she going to be this way her entire life?  I asked the breeder and she suggested that she might calm down around 3 or 4 years old.  I might give the dog up by then.  I have a lot of time and money invested in Trunchie, and I love her deeply.  When she's not beating people up, she too is a fantastic dog.  We have so much fun on our hikes together, and I do believe she could make a great therapy dog one day.  My last dog and I went to nursing homes and it was a great thing for all of us.  I understand that every dog is different but wow.  If I just left her alone all day, I would understand, because her needs are not being met. But she gets hours of exercise every day, and is never home alone.

36,dogs,"I‚Äôve also stood by my stance that people should only get dogs in one of two ways: either from a reputable/responsible shelter/rescue or from a reputable/responsible breeder. I‚Äôve only had rescue dogs so when it came time to get my shelter dog a companion, I decided to go with a well bred purebred. 

I did hours of research on breeds and settled on a breeder who had an opening on her waitlist for a puppy from CHIC tested, AKC conformation titled parents. I double checked that parents,grandparents and close relatives all had passing OFAs and double checked titles. This litter piqued my interest as well since the puppies have a lower than average COI for the breed. The cherry on top was that the breeder also did Puppy Culture. 

When I got my puppy home, it was pretty apparent that she was very timid. This seemed odd since the breeder knew I wanted a show and therapy dog, but I put forth a lot of time, money and effort to get my new puppy more confident. About a month after getting the puppy, I started to notice that she would have terrible diarrhea, vomiting, then she‚Äôd refuse to eat for days. The TLDR version is that I spent 4-5 months and countless dollars before we finally tried a food allergy trial. This seemed to be the ticket since all the vomiting and diarrhea have disappeared, plus she very happily eats every day. The downside is her prescription food costs me about $150/month. But I didn‚Äôt let this get me down as I figured it‚Äôs one weird health issue and the temperament problem has basically gone away. I continued showing and training my puppy to pretty good success (couple of BOB and group placings under her belt). 

Two weeks ago, I was sitting in my living room and I noticed that my now 1 year old dog was laying down as normal. When she went to get up, she was suddenly three legged lame. It looked like a classic CCL tear, so I rushed her in to the vet the next day. The vet noticed her lameness but nothing came up with the drawer test. I was sent home with NSAIDs and told to come back for X-rays in a week if she isn‚Äôt better. 

It‚Äôs been a week and she‚Äôs still off and on lame. I can‚Äôt think of any event to cause the CCL tear as she basically is either crated, free running under supervision or working on FitPaws equipment with supervision. I have an appointment for X-rays scheduled next week but I‚Äôm an absolute wreck. I think I‚Äôm working my way through the 7 stages of grief. 

I just can‚Äôt believe I spent all this time and money researching and buying a well bred purebred to have it end up being the most expensive dog I‚Äôve ever owned. This feels like a complete paradigm shift, like my entire worldview has been challenged. Why not just buy a dog off Craigslist or at a pet store? 

I‚Äôm at a loss for next steps as well. If my dog has a CCL tear, I probably won‚Äôt be able to show her anymore as she‚Äôs a coated hand scissor breed that requires weekly grooming. She‚Äôll have to be shaved for the surgery and by the time her coat grows back, she‚Äôll probably be 2 or 3 years old. Also, I‚Äôm worried about leaving her intact if she‚Äôs already had this many issues before she‚Äôs 2.

37,dogs,"My dog recently turned 2, so I don‚Äôt think this question belongs in r/puppy. My dog has always been very needy (constantly begging for attention, constantly begging for play and stimulation regardless of how long he‚Äôs been played with, walked, interacted with, etc.) So when he‚Äôs with me alone, I try to encourage and reward calm behavior (hanging out, chewing on toys, getting calm and gentle pets.) I‚Äôm genuinely open to any and all suggestions. 

Since he‚Äôs turned 2 he has mellowed out significantly, but it still feels like the attention he demands is *constant.* I even wonder if everyone always stopping what they‚Äôre doing to shower him with undivided attention is adding to the problem? I realize that may sound callous, but there are 4 adults in my house and when one person stops pets or play, he will move on to the next until he makes another cycle. It is literally all day long. I just want my dog to be well adjusted. So far we haven‚Äôt had a separation anxiety issue in terms of destruction in the house, but when his humans come home after being gone he will whine incessantly/bark (even after being greeted, pet, and loved upon.)

51,dogs,"Hi!

I've been thinking about getting a dog for about 3-4 years now. I never really went on with it because I never had a dog before and I don't know if I'm a good fit to own a dog.

I work in IT so I CAN work from home 3 days a week, but most of the time I don't. Which means I'm not home from 7:30 to 16:30. I have a small garden (about 15m2) but this is not accessible from my living room very easily since I live in a ""belle-etage"" apartment (this means I have 2 floors in my apartment).

Anyway. I live alone, no other pets or animals. I have no pet-experience, apart from a fish and a bird.

If I would own a dog I would 100% go to dog school. I've been thinking about going to the dog shelter because those dogs really need a loving home, but since I never owned a dog it might be best to go for a puppy? I'm not sure which breed would be ideal for me, but I always loved the cuteness of a english staffy.

I own a campervan and I think it would be amazing to take my dog with me when I travel. I'm also very sporty so going for walks, runs or whatever shouldn't be an issue.

54,dogs,"Apologies, I don‚Äôt usually ask for advice but this is eating me up. 

TLDR; due to an extreme change in behavior I believe live my dog has been abused or scared at my groomer. 


He‚Äôs a 2 year old, 15 pound malti poo mix, and he‚Äôs absolutely my baby. We watched my sisters dog when she went to jail(unrelated, but she‚Äôs finally clean THANK GOD). While her dog was here she had a single puppy in my hamper, I was there with her with a line to the vet and cut the cord and sack. 2 months later dog mom went back to my sister and he stayed; he‚Äôs been my kissy little cry man ever since. 

As soon as he had all his shots he started at a local groomer, a single location mom and pop with good reviews. His hair doesn‚Äôt shed and never stops growing and he gets hot too easily if it‚Äôs not trimmed regularly, he goes every 4th Saturday at 12:30. Everything has been great until 2 appointments ago. 

The first time something was off we went to the car to go to the groomers and he was acting Wierd, like he didn‚Äôt want to go. We got to the groomers and he jumped around the car not letting me catch him. Wierd, but he‚Äôd been going there for a year and a half and he‚Äôs a drama Queen, whatever. Nothing seems odd when I pick him up.

The second time the appointment was a couple hours earlier for some reason I don‚Äôt recall so he gets in the car fine, but when we get close to the groomers he starts shaking violently and then goes and hides as far back in my 4 runner as he can physically get, giving me the most upset look ever and softly whimpering. Now I‚Äôm concerned, but I still take him in because like I said he really can be a drama Queen but this behavior is totally abnormal for him, and I do mention to them his behavior and how out of character it is. I drop him off anyways and plan on popping in In the middle of his appointment to check on him but the appointment was done half as soon and I didn‚Äôt get the chance. 

All is seemingly well when I pick him up, but then he refuses to go anywhere near the driveway for the next 2 days and we typically go on a lot of bye byes with his furry siblings on weekends but he‚Äôs just not having it, also super super uncharacteristic. He has little games he loves to play with the other dogs on the way out to the car and he‚Äôs not doing those, he‚Äôs hiding behind my father in law(who never takes him to the groomer). He may be dramatic as hell but twice isn‚Äôt a fluke. 

On to my dilemma- I‚Äôm torn. His next appointment is tomorrow as 12:30. The lady that owns this place is the kindest most gentle person, and so is her assistant. I had noticed the last few months a now hiring sign is always up and there has been a new person every time I‚Äôve picked him up. I don‚Äôt think the owner stays all days on Saturdays either, she‚Äôs almost always there when I drop him, but rarely when I pick him up. So she probably isn‚Äôt aware of the issue. He could be naughty and someone got on him for it, or idk but I don‚Äôt know if their legit abusing him but something is up at the very least. 

I was thinking maybe just switching him to a weekday appointment- a luxury I didn‚Äôt have when he first started going in hopes maybe it‚Äôs slower then and the owner will be there the whole time. But do I mention the issue? I know I would want to know if I had an employee I needed to be concerned about but I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm accusing or attacking her. Idk I feel slimy about the whole thing but what I‚Äôm definitely not going to do is nothing. This little guy depends on me to protect him. I don‚Äôt particularly want to switch groomers if I can avoid it.

Although I have asked them several times if he‚Äôs bratty and if there‚Äôs anything I need to work with him on to make their lives easier and they always say ‚Äúno he‚Äôs a doll, he just has a lot to say‚Äù. Then again they probably wouldn‚Äôt tell me my dog is the spawn of Satan but we have tried really hard to curate a open and honest dialog with these people and we tip pretty fat most of the time.

55,dogs,"Good morning. We have a 4.5 y/o Shepherd mix shelter rescue that we adopted 3 weeks ago - just myself and my husband. He is very sweet and has learned some obedience (like sit for a treat), but we are going to hire a trainer to work on other commands. He was found as a stray in a rural area and we have no idea how he was previously treated‚Ä¶ but he understands we go potty outside and he likes sleeping in his kennel at night. My question is‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs super hyper first thing in the morning. After our morning walk, he‚Äôll hop on the couch with my husband, immediately get on his back, and start mouthing at my husband‚Äôs hands. When this starts we try 1 of 2 things: 1) Redirect him with a chew toy instead of hands or 2) My husband will stand up and the dog will hop off the couch and follow him around. He has tried this with me maybe twice, but it‚Äôs every morning with my husband. The hubs is def the ‚Äúpack leader‚Äù. Is this playful behavior that means he‚Äôs happy/wanting to play and needs some additional training or is he telling us something is wrong and he‚Äôs uncomfortable with us?

Also, he broke free of his harness and collar twice on early mornings right before pooping‚Ä¶ makes us wonder if something happened to him previously that he associates fear with pooping? Or maybe he‚Äôs learning to poop on a leash? Both times he ran around the neighborhood for 15 minutes and then came back to our house‚Ä¶ scared the you know what out of us.

She's a 3 months old mixed breed, small/medium size, we got her 3 1 months ago and today she's 3.

She's still putting out teeths and she bites everything and that's almost fine.

She prefers cloths with our smell, sockets, shoes and is still ok.

We bought her bones, toys, puppets to have fun with.

She likes play with us, pulling the toys with her teeth and growling, but doesn't look like an aggressive one.

She likes to grab things and being chased.


The problem is this: she keeps also biting our hands/fingers when she's playing or when she's happy and she jumps on us. 

We had already 3 dogs during our life time and noone of them was biting. They were all Yorkshire breed, maybe her mixed breed is something that made her so ""aggressive""? 
I mean, she doesn't attack, she just use the mouth and teeths to play AND to show affection.

The strange thing is that when we take her outside and she meets stranger, she jumps on them and start LICKING them. I always warn them that she might bite but she never did.

Only with us she bites.

She‚Äôs deaf, mostly blind, can‚Äôt climb up and down stairs, stares into the distance and barks especially in the evenings. Has a hacking reverse sneeze/cough that has many episodes a day, crouches to eat or stand, and pees in the house several times a day even though we take her out often. She can‚Äôt go on walks anymore so we plop her in the stroller basket below our kid and she‚Äôs content there. 

Basically she just sleeps all day, or stands around watching us, or is looking out in the distance. She doesn‚Äôt play with toys like she used to, gets a little excited to see us but not in the way she used to, and overall just seems unhappy. 

I think because the vet told us she‚Äôs mostly fine apart from age related stuff, we never considered putting her down but lately there are more bad days than good and we feel like we need to make some decisions. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this where bloodwork doesn‚Äôt indicate anything wrong but quality of life is poor?  I feel guilty even thinking about putting her down but I also don‚Äôt want her to suffer and be miserable.

So we‚Äôre struggling with making a decision about our pup and summer travel.
Little background of our dog, she‚Äôs a vizsla, 1y in Feb, still working on her reactivity on leash, she‚Äôs getting better and better every day. She‚Äôs not the friendly type, she takes her time before trusting someone and she got very attached with us. Also, she‚Äôs not a big fan of traveling with the car(she‚Äôs lying down but not fully relaxing, not  sleeping).
We got her at 5months from our home country  and traveled 1m later to our current working country.
Usually during summer we are traveling back home for 1month and half. 
Our dilemma is if it‚Äôs better to take her with us or leave her with a pet sitter in our house for 2-3 weeks. On the way home it‚Äôs no direct flight, there is a stop in Netherlands where she will stay at a pet hotel and second day she will reach to us. Back it‚Äôs a direct flight.( note that our working country is in Middle East where summers are very hot)
We did left her few times with a pet sitter, but no more than a 10-12 hours and we could see that she is sad, whining at the door and not interested in playing.

Is it a viable option to walk him before/after work and train him to use puppy pads while I‚Äôm gone?

80,dogs,"So this is a long story I will try to make short. Baby girl is a rescue, found on the streets of Detroit, abandoned, in deadly cold weather. A saint of a person worked his a\*\* off to save her and find a foster that would allow her to find a good home and live. This was 7 years ago. We love my little baby so so much. Which is why this is so terrifying.

So she used to not be able to be left alone for more than say 15 minutes. We tried everything. She panicked and did such naughties and we would come home to a panicked panting dog. Just panicking. We had a family dog that stayed with us often that we realized made her much more comfy being alone. We were loved him dearly and we were heartbroken when he passed a short time later.

After a number of years, and our baby girl desiring doggy companionship, we felt we were in a place to get a brother! Everything was so so wonderful. He has his stuff, and it's been hard in some ways as have a much harder time having people over because he is the doggy police, but he is fantastic. They love each other very much, and separation disappeared with both! I cried like a baby the first time we watched the cams leaving them home for a bit, as they napped!

So it's been a year and a half, and all of a sudden she has started panicking again. It scares me to death. A few times we just assumed she was hungry, and justified her grabbing things off the table and eating or tearing. Today she was just.... she was so bad. I care mostly because I am TERRIFIED she is going to get into something or eat something that will hurt her. We cannot go on like this.

We have some ideas, but would REALLY appreciate any input from anyone who has been through this situation and has any ideas. We did negative reinforcement for the first time ever after we were basically in tears 10 minutes on the way home as we were sure she was chewing on a cam and terrified she would be electrocuted. Maybe this will help, maybe not, but we had to try. We have trazodone we are going to try, more exercise, and upping her prozac, and we will go from there, but if anyone could share what helped in a similar circumstance.... It would mean so much.

82,dogs,"I was hesitant to post but the material I‚Äôve found online doesn‚Äôt fully address what I‚Äôve witnessed &amp; experienced.

my 5 mo old red lab is my BFF in the whole world &amp; I love her to bits. 3 dudes in the house + me, and she has blown past that archetype of female dogs dumping on their human ‚Äúmom‚Äù in a predominantly male environment (our house). 

I‚Äôm in tech but work for a euro firm hq abroad &amp; since Covid have filled a retainer-styled position (renewals and add-ons for the clients and contracts I brought in‚Ä¶.80% of the company was furloughed &amp; things just vibed w what my kids need of me, so this works). Dogs have been a force in my life since birth - my father bred Alsatian shepherds for law enforcement and military in England; in the US we always had 3-4 shelter doggos at home; so while furloughed I revisited caring for dogs. Now my afternoon gig has evolved to taking a crew of 6-10 dogs that I‚Äôve trained to go off leash &amp; travel within my orbit on some bitchin hikes. We‚Äôve had some incredible adventures and w my 24 y/o baby brother dying a few months before pandemic lockdown‚Ä¶..this is the most soul fulfilling thing I‚Äôve known since late 2019. 

And then we got our puppy, who took that soul healing and is the best thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. Like‚Ä¶.I want her to live forever but 25+ years is ok; we‚Äôll be buried together; I‚Äôm lamenting the market absence of surgically embedded gps; and recently am aware that cloning dogs is a thing now.

TL/DR: I love my puppy dearly and recently have licked her face a few times &amp; each time she looks stunned. Not sure if that‚Äôs good or bad. She still gives me belly when in trouble. I know licking is often from sub to dom, but of equal value it also reflects affection. Only started this a week ago and yes 50% of the time she‚Äôs taken aback but regardless 99% of the time she responds by taking *her* kisses up a notch &amp; aggressively licking my face. I‚Äôm not suggesting anything inappropriate. She‚Äôs my baby and at this point pretty much will be my only daughter. I herniated my ribs carrying her around, she‚Äôs nearly 60 pounds already. She and I drove 3 days back home from Wisconsin when I kidnapped her from her breeder‚Äôs litter. I love her infinitely &amp; don‚Äôt encourage looking in mirrors, or chasing reflections or laser beams bc it breaks dogs brains. Is it ok to lick her face if it‚Äôs gone well so far, the few times I‚Äôve done it? üíö",t2_1xcvws9q,0,licking your dogs face,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zysqxl,True,grycentipede,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zysqxl/licking_your_dogs_face/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zysqxl/licking_your_dogs_face/,2476578,1672380075,0,,False,1672380086,1672380087,2022-12-30 06:01:15,,,,,,,

94,dogs,"Hello! 
I was hoping to get some advice on an issue I‚Äôve been having with my dog. In early December he became very ill and had to spend two nights at the pet hospital (turned out he developed a horrible allergy to chicken and wheat). 

He‚Äôs better now, but ever since having been away from us he refuses to sleep in the living room anymore. He used to sleep well on the couch or on his bed in the living room. Since being sick, he scratches at our bedroom door and will only sleep in our bed.

We‚Äôve tried a variety of things including bringing him back out to the living room (over and over), staying with him until he falls asleep (he just wakes up and comes back to our room), and moving his bed into our room. Nothing works. He will only sleep with my husband and I. 

We would really like him to not sleep in our bed but we are running out of ideas. Any suggestions?

I do have muttluks except the problem is‚Ä¶. Most likely they will fall off because of powdery snow, snow will get inside of them making them wet and cold‚Ä¶ 

I have mushers secret but I mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not going to prevent frostbite. I thought about the balloon booties ‚Äòpawz‚Äô or whatever for a tighter fit / less snow/ less chance of it falling off in the deep snow.. but again, not going to prevent frostbite.  

I have a *shiba* (his winter coat also is growing in and he‚Äôs very fluffy now, I have a small windbreaker for him as well) and he LOVES the cold and snow, he often chooses to stay outside in 15-20¬∞ weather and lays out there with windchills so it feels like below 10¬∞, but that‚Äôs dry with no snow. I have hiked with him in the snow before but temps were around 20-35¬∞ and sunny. 

I‚Äôm seriously concerned and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

There is a chance we can go hiking to that spot another day where it will be up to 20¬∞ but I‚Äôm not sure if we can make it because we are also leaving that day and checking out. **But if we can: is 20¬∞ OK?** I‚Äôm leaning towards yes since we‚Äôve already hiked in those conditions before and he was completely fine and extremely happy but I‚Äôd also like to hear from the general public.",t2_tdq701ps,0,"Taking my dog on a potential snow-y hike, how can I be safe?

My moms other two dogs would ignore her and made her stressed, and I fell in love with her when I visited from out of state so I took her home. She thrived in a less stressful environment, put on some weight, and has been so so happy. I‚Äôve had her for about a year and a half. 

Over the last six months she‚Äôs been having issues. Vomiting, becoming more aggressive with other dogs, and the main thing is the messing. She‚Äôs in diapers now but she still messes and it spills over, she‚Äôs so narrow that diapers don‚Äôt stay on her well, and she hates them. We‚Äôve tried that, things to hold them up, pee pads, taking her out more, training, crating. She is not peeing out of incontinence but behavior. And her pee is so hard to get out of the carpet, it takes us days of scrubbing and carpet cleaning but it will still be there. My other dog has now started messing in the house when she messes. She‚Äôs been to the vet and she is healthy. 

Whenever we go anywhere, even the store she‚Äôll mess. It‚Äôs at the point where we don‚Äôt feel we can go anywhere because we‚Äôre worried about cleaning up. We can‚Äôt trust her to be out of her diaper or even alone, and I feel she is unhappy in general with having to be in the diaper. 

My mom offered to take her back because we cannot handle hours of our day every day being about cleaning up multiple messes and the dogs. My mom now has a third dog who I do believe will be nice to Mabel.

He has a regular diet, regular exercises and overall a very good life.

The trouble now becomes that my roommates and I are no longer going to be living together soon. I‚Äôve tried a few other options in terms of living with people but no luck. I believe I am going to be getting an apartment by myself at this point. The only problem with that is that I‚Äôm worried for my dog. I work 10 hours a day, 4 days a week. Going to and from work will be 30 minutes going both ways living in the new apartment.

I work a job that doesn‚Äôt have any breaks necessarily and requires me to stick to a zone so I am unable to return home until after work. My dog will now have to spend 11 hours by himself. I also work overnight shift, from 9pm-6am.

That was really bizarre to me because the one I worked at was pretty lax. All you had to do was fill out the application and not be on the banned list (which was pretty hard to get on).

122,dogs,"Hi everyone,

So we found out about a month ago that our 12 year old pup has oral melanoma. 
We spent $2k in imaging and almost $700 just in vet/specialist visits. 
We got our estimate for the surgery which will be somewhere between $8,400-$11,400 USD. 
Since the cancer hasn‚Äôt spread anywhere, and it‚Äôs only on one side of her jaw were going to do the surgery. They say she will have a good chance of quality life for awhile. We are going to do the melanoma vaccine after. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure we will skip chemo/radiation just because with the surgery and vaccine she‚Äôs already going through so much. 
I just hope I‚Äôm making the right choices for my dog. She still has a lot of life in her which is why I won‚Äôt just give up on her because of age. 
My family has made a couple comments subtly trying to advise me to reconsider financially how much my partner and I are putting into this which makes me feel so disheartened. I see my dogs like my babies. The money doesn‚Äôt matter to me but her quality of life. That‚Äôs what im basing my decisions off of. 
I just feel really alone even though I share her with my partner. He‚Äôs doing what needs to be done but emotionally I feel like im going through this alone. 
A few years when we moved in together I asked if I could take her from my parents house since I was always closest to her. That‚Äôs when my partner decided to be her step dad (lol). But she‚Äôs been mine since I was 14 and she was just a little puppy. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm really just so scared something will happen in surgery. I‚Äôm also nervous that maybe I‚Äôm making the wrong decisions on her care. I just want her to be as happy and pain free with us for as possible.

my moms 13-year-old dog Rosie had diarrhea for a week a month ago. 

Vet said dog flu. Rosie took antibiotics for a week and recovered. The whole time she was put on a diet of strictly chicken and rice.

So a week in, Rosie began eating 1/2 science diet kibble and 1/2 her usual Rachel ray kibble.

Then her tummy issues came back. Vet said she had gastroenteritis. Rosie was put on antibiotics and hydration stuff for a week. During this time Rosie ate once again just chicken, rice, bland food. Well in this mix of bland food was venison. Now, Rosie is super picky. She will only eat boiled beef &amp; pate sticky rice.

131,dogs,"Hi! I have an almost 2 year old Boston Terrier that I am nearly at my wits end with. I cannot for the life of me get her to stop having accidents in the house.

I‚Äôve had her since she was 8 weeks old. From the first night we had her, she would pee and poop in her crate and not seem bothered by it at all. She would also pee every 15-20 mins, a little bit at a time. She also figured out when she was little that the best way to get our attention was to pee in her crate and roll around in it so we would come and get her because the other option was to let her sleep in her own filth. It took me nearly a year to get her to stop treating her crate as a potty area. It took a lot of feedings and short times in the crate for her to grow out of it.

Here are things I‚Äôve done:

1. Crate training consistently. She can be in her crate for up to 7-8 hours during the day without issues, and 12 hours at night. She still sleeps in her crate every night.

2. No puppy pads. The first 6 months I had her I religiously took her outside every 20-30 min during the day. Every 3 hours at night. We have a balcony with a grass patch for when she was young and then fully outside when she was vaccinated. She needs to be taken out, doggy doors are not an option since we don‚Äôt have a yard and the balcony isn‚Äôt fully enclosed.

3. I take her out once every 4-5 hours now, on a schedule, and reward her EVERY time she urinates outside.

4. I scrubbed every surface she‚Äôs had an accident on and treated with enzyme cleaners

5. Medical reasons have been ruled out

6. I thought maybe since she‚Äôs spayed she may have a little incontinence, so I bought her bladder control supplements but those haven‚Äôt made a difference.

7. She signals when she needs to go - she stands at the door and when I don‚Äôt notice she comes to get me. We‚Äôve tried the potty button but she wasn‚Äôt understanding the idea of it

8. She has a ‚Äúgo potty‚Äù command and I stand outside until she‚Äôs fully emptied her bladder

9. She naturally doesn‚Äôt drink a lot of water so I don‚Äôt restrict her intake 

10. She‚Äôs never been punished for an accident. We interrupt and then take her outside 

11. We don‚Äôt let her see us cleaning up her messes

12. I monitor her constantly. She‚Äôs never left alone if she‚Äôs not crated

13. We don‚Äôt clean with ammonia

14. Every time she has an accident we go back to more frequent potty breaks and gradually stretch it back out

15. I‚Äôve taken her to several trainers who all only had suggestions I‚Äôve already tried

16. Vet also didn‚Äôt have suggestions

17. I‚Äôve tried tethering her to me, and she did fine, but when I started trusting her again she went right back to it. This isn‚Äôt an option long term since I can‚Äôt tether a dog to me every minute I‚Äôm home for the lifetime of the dog

But for some reason, about once a week or every other week, she will randomly have an accident 1-2 hours after she‚Äôs gone outside. The other day she had an accident in her crate, something she hasn‚Äôt done in a long time. 

She doesn‚Äôt have anxiety, and when she has an accident she doesn‚Äôt signal, she will just randomly pee somewhere in the moment I‚Äôm not looking. 

This is mainly with urine, she‚Äôs been very good about her poop. I know she KNOWS she‚Äôs not supposed to go inside the house because she stops herself midstream. She will do this at all times, even if we have no visitors, no changes in the house, she‚Äôs not being ignored, and our schedule has been the same.

I just can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs not clicking for her. Everyone else I‚Äôve spoken to has said their dog was a breeze to train and they NEVER have accidents whatsoever and can be left at home without problems for the entire work day

I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything outside of crating her for 8 hours during the day to ‚Äútrain‚Äù her bladder, which seems cruel to me since she spends about 9-10 hours in there at night already.

Am I just stuck with a dog that cannot be trusted alone? Everything else about her is perfect - she doesn‚Äôt chew on anything that doesn‚Äôt belong to her, she doesn‚Äôt even touch anything that‚Äôs not her toy, not reactive to dogs or people, but this one thing I can‚Äôt get her to understand.

She tries to destroy things, crawl under or behind stuff and try to be close to people but scratch and hurt them in the process. Her eyes are wide open but unfocused. She starts breathing heavily and she makes weird huffy howling noises.
My parents had to buy a cage, so they could sleep some nights. but she destroyed it in a bad panic attack. We then bought a smaller one made from better materials and she responded well to that. She feels safe in it and sometimes she even calms down when they put her in the cage.

The panic attacks got alot better since then, but now people are starting to use fireworks and she is having some of the worst panic attacks yet. She tries to break out of her cage with such force, that im afraid shell hurt herself. I even saw some blood on he cage that must have come from her biting into it to hard.

148,dogs,"Hey r/dogs!

My family is looking at adopting a golden retriever puppy, we are considering a few different picks of the litter but one is a puppy they are calling ‚Äúlucky‚Äù he was the first one born and was born when the breeder let the mom out to the bathroom,  the mom came back holding ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and gave birth to him in the cold.  The breeder claims the puppy was in the cold for 5 minutes and his tail froze and is shorter and significantly shorter then his litter mates. 

The breeder got it checked out by a Vet and got a clean bill of heath and the Vet said no problems down the road should come up due to the frozen tail.  

Just wanted to get some opinions on if you guys think the frozen tail could lead to early health problems (ie arthritis) or if he was in the cold for long enough for his tail to freeze would anything else‚Äôs to freeze that would be a health problem

149,dogs,"I have an 11yo lab/gsd cross who got into the bag if kibble and (unsurprisingly) ate too much. He was very bloated and full and vomited a lot, so I put him on chicken and rice for a few days. After 2 days he stopped wanting food, and after we persuaded him to eat he puked again. Ofc I took him to the vets ASAP and after a thorough check they told me he damaged his stomach lining a little by being a greedy brat and had developed an infection. 

He's been on antibiotics and a special food for the last week, and he's doing better. No more puking, seems in a good mood. Pooping okay. But he seems a little constipated/bloated. We took him back for a checkup today and they said he's mostly fine but would like to see him stay on the vet food, and to have another round of anti biotics. I mentioned the bloating and they checked that, reckon it's a mix of antibiotics and new food messing with his gut, and prescribed anti gas drops. 

Now he seems mostly fine, he's happy for his dinner, still pooping daily (although it's definitely smaller and denser than normal), but I think his tummy is a bit uncomfortable and it seems to be messing with his sleep a bit. I'd like for him to get more rest and be comfortable so I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do to gently reduce the gas/constipation without interfering with his meds? 

Tl;Dr: Lab cross ate too much and hurt his tummy. He's under vet care and is mostly fine, but he's still on meds and special vet food.

152,dogs,"Hello, first time poster here, first time dog owner (of my own, have had family dogs before I moved out). 

Some background, I live with my fiance and I work from home while she does not. This means I am home effectively all the time, and it is not uncommon for her to leave to go to work daily, or nearly daily (as of right now we are off work for the rest of the year, but she will still do things like go to the store or whatever).


As for the question, I have a 15 week old puppy who has been living with us since 12 weeks. She's settled in pretty nicely and things have been going quite well for the most part. Within the past few days though, she's developed a behavior that I'm not sure how to go about dealing with. Essentially, sometimes I will take the puppy with me into my office so that my fiance can get stuff done, and sometimes vice versa as well. For a while this was fine, however recently she has started very much whining if my fiance leaves the room. Not only this, but she will start trying to claw at the door and stuff like that. It should be noted she does not do this if I leave the room, only her. (Note: it doesn't matter what room, this seems to happen anywhere).

Both of us treat her essentially the same, we take her out roughly the same amount of times, feed her the same amount, play with her the same amount, etc. She is a very people-oriented dog (she absolutely loves everyone and loves to be held). So when my fiance leaves, it surprised me how different her reaction is, over if it was me who left.

My best guess is, she gets upset about her leaving and not me, because I rarely actually leave to go anywhere, and I'm always home. She also loves to try to sleep on top of my fiance at night, and is fine just laying in bed with her for hours.

Currently, I'm just kinda letting my puppy whine it out until she calms down, but I'm curious if there's a better way to go about this, or if there's something else I should do?

165,dogs,"This is not a loaded question -- I'm genuinely curious.

I volunteer at an animal shelter and often see folks surrender dogs that have clearly served only one purpose in their life: to be a guard dog or security system.

When people surrender them,  they show no emotion, no remorse, no love for the animal -- the transaction itself is so nonchalant it boggles my mind; like they're dropping their busted up car at a junkyard.

The dogs often come in either malnourished or so poorly socialized they can't be around other dogs early on in the rehab process.

As a lover of dogs, I'm curious how people who leave their dogs chained up and outside all day long   rationalize their behavior.

And it‚Äôs getting worse as he gets older! He‚Äôs a husky, he generally gets 2+ miles of walks a day, he gets to play in the backyard with his sister (who also eats random things but isn‚Äôt as bad). 

It all started when we went from free feeding to schedule feeding. My girl was getting overweight, so we had to switch. Soon after, he ate a damn toy (literally out of my sight for the time it took me to stand up and chase after him). The toy was stuffed with fabric, we didn‚Äôt know that he had eaten it. He got a blockage and had surgery. We‚Äôve had other incidents since with both dogs. We do everything we can to keep the house clear and safe. Inside the house isn‚Äôt as big of an issue. 

We tried switching back to free feeding, they were literally going to make themselves sick. It wasn‚Äôt going to work. I give them a ton of veggies with each meal (3 meals a day). They‚Äôre fed enough to maintain their weights. They get treats. They get tons of attention. They‚Äôve had recent blood work. We can‚Äôt switch food easily because of food allergies and sensitive tummies. Someone is always home with them. But they‚Äôll just grab something and start chewing. 

I‚Äôve stopped them, I‚Äôve tried redirecting, I‚Äôve scolded, I‚Äôve pulled stuff out of their mouths, I‚Äôve picked them up before they manage to eat stuff. They listen with just about everything else. They‚Äôre so smart. This? Nah, fluff it they‚Äôll eat it all. 

My boy is going to kill himself. I really don‚Äôt want to have to muzzle him. Especially just to let him outside. We just moved to a new house. My husband and I both went around the yard and picked up everything we could find that had blown in. The yards now covered in snow. He still found something and was chewing.

This is 100% on me, but when she was a pup I was very focused on desensitising ears and feet that I neglected mouth - first time dog owner and wont make that mistake again. She is in no way aggressive when you handle her mouth, but she turns into the world's squirmiest worm, and it's near impossible to see anything.

I don't want the vet or any techs to have to deal with that. So far I've just been taking it slow, little finger in the mouth and then a treat once she accepts it.

175,dogs,"That's how long I've had dogs and over that time I've only ever had bitches. In April of this year, I adopted a 4 year old male (3 at the time) Romanian mix called rusty.  Rusty seemed very fussy with his food from the get go, turning his nose up at almost anything except chicken and the occasional bit of sausage. Putting kibble in his food did nothing, he would literally move it with his nose, eat the chicken and walk away. Over a period of months, about every two weeks, he would vomit. Nothing granular but liquidy acid vomit. This kept happening and kept happening. On one occasion, he vomited a couple of times and didnt eat for 30 hours, no matter what I tried. I decided that enough was enough. I took him to the vets practice that I've been using for decades where he had one of many physicals, bloods drawn, anti sickness jabs and I had a long discussion with the vet. The colour of his poo also bothered me for a long time. It was always dark with a coating of mucus and somewhat firm. When all of his bloods came back clear, the vet and I decided that the only thing it could be that is triggering these episodes was in fact the chicken. I stopped the chicken and got him onto an hypoallergenic diet of Burns Duck and Brown Rice kibble exclusively, nothing added. Since he has been on this diet, weve only had one small episode of vomiting which the vet was not concerned about because it was only once he had vomited but if he continued he would indeed see him again to give him some anti sickness jabs. I should mention that for a few months now he has been on a daily course of omeprazole to try to combat excess acid.  He was initially diagnosed with bilious vomiting syndrome and the vet suspects he may also have IBS. I am finding that, on occasions, getting two meals a day down him is literally impossible. He will have one meal and then seems quite content even though his other meal will be waiting for him about 5 hours later. I have also mentioned this to the vet who is not concerned if he only eats one meal a day because he is maintaining weight and is in a good condition.

178,dogs,"How much peeing is incontinence? I have a German Shepherd who is nearly 14. My basic rule over the last year or so has been to go out with him about every three hours. Lately, if I leave him alone for three it's likely that I'll find a small piddle. I think most of those are from excitement. He has to go, sees a dog or delivery person out the window, barks and pees a bit. I've had a couple times recently when family obligations kept me away for almost four hours, and he left more substantial pees. He generally does okay overnight, and will only go in the house if the day's schedule  was disrupted some way.

So, is there some line between having accidents and incontinence? We've just given blood and urine samples - kidneys and liver are pretty good for his age.

179,dogs,"Hello!

My toy poodle is 16 with heart disease. For the last 1.5 years, I've taken him three times to the cardiologist at their suggestion for tests and x-rays. It is about $800 each check-up, and I'm quickly learning that is not sustainable for my budget and income.

Each time, the cardiologist tells me he's doing great and to keep doing what I'm doing (which are giving his meds--vetmedin, amlodipine, benezepril). From my understanding, the x-rays are to track the size of his heart until it gets too big, and from there, the cardiologist told me they would be able to tell me when he'd have approx 6 months left. I have his annual check-up coming up, but I don't know if I want to pay another $800 just to hear the same thing(or the opposite, which is how much time he'd have left...).

Needless to say, they are different dogs, mine being a little bit more calm lol. 
For exercise: Mine goes on long walks in the mornings in the city and then longer walks after work (so total about 2+ hours walking) and his goes for shorter runs throughout the day.

Recently, the GSP is acting up where he seems to be claiming bed space and peeing in the house. My boyfriend has let him sleep in the bed since puppy which I don‚Äôt mind if there are no behavior issues but the other night at MY apartment, his dog snapped at mine for jumping on the bed when he didn‚Äôt even go near him. I can understand if my dog stepped on him or whatever else, but he didn‚Äôt even go near him and he snapped.
After that, we weren‚Äôt allowing him on the bed, and kept him out of the room. He then peed in the living room. He‚Äôs also done this a few times at my boyfriends house, peeing on the rug in the bedroom and the snapping at my dog as well. 

He‚Äôs a bit possessive of toys, to the point he got into a fight with my dog over a toy (this was after mine issued a warning growl, but the GSP didn‚Äôt take the hint). 

Asking for help and your take on the situation because I‚Äôm really not sure what to do here. I‚Äôm trying to not make my bf feel like shit about this but the GSP needs training.

Just today, I have found another one residing in the top right hand corner of her chest area, 2x smaller than the original one, three days after we went hiking.

193,dogs,"I really admire and adore LGD breeds and as  an idea, I‚Äôd like a pretty small farm. Like really small, just a handful of livestock or whatnot. I‚Äôm aware that LGDs are innately tempermental, so I wouldn‚Äôt ever dream of getting one unless I gave them a job to do to exercise their innate behavior. I am not so experienced in having larger, more aggressive breeds though. I still want a dog well socialized and good with strangers if I bring them to the vet, to walks in public, invite strangers on my property, etc. 


Major downside is I‚Äôm not sure if the dog can determine the difference between acceptable contact or a threat. I don‚Äôt want a fierce dog attacking the mailman. I‚Äôm not against intensive training and socialization as a puppy, I‚Äôm just not sure how effective or feasible or realistic that is. 


I wanted to see if anyone is experienced. I have seen one anecdotal post about someone having a fairly good Ovchartka/Central Asian with no major tempermental issues, seems like a rare exception however. 


The breeds I‚Äôm most interested in are central asian, Anatolian Shepherd, akbash, and Maremma. I know the pyrenees is extremely popular for great temperments but not a fan of the thick coat.

195,dogs,"I began dogsitting for an acquaintance yesterday morning. The plan is to dogsit through Sunday, and then someone else will watch the dogs for the remainder (as I had other plans). I had taken care of these dogs with no issue earlier this year. For anonymity, I will call the dogs A and B.

A is 14 years old, a smaller dog who has definitely slowed down in her old age. She did not like the cold weather we received last weekend, and when I picked up the house key earlier this week, I was told that it was possible A would not make it to the first day of dogsitting, so I could only be watching B.

B is 7 years old, is fine.

I arrived at the house yesterday morning to find A in her crate, covered in feces and some spots of blood. B was fine, but A clearly had a bad morning between her family‚Äôs departure and my arrival. I saw that some of her stools had blood. I cleaned her up, threw her bed in the wash, and tried to get her to eat her food; she showed some interest but threw most of it up. B mostly looked concerned for his sister. Contacted the owners, and they said they only had an emergency vet, no current vet for regular visits. I had to leave for a few hours, and when I put A in her crate, she bit me (skin didn‚Äôt break, and she had a rough morning, so I‚Äôm not upset, just sad she had a rough start to her day).

Yesterday afternoon, both dogs appeared alright (outside of B escaping his crate), A ate her dinner with no issues, had more pep in her step. I didn‚Äôt see any signs of bleeding. Took the dogs out around 9:40, and when I woke them up this morning at 7:00, I found that A once again had two-three accidents through the night (luckily did not lay in it). I also found the cause of the bleeding- her nose is very scratched up. It should be black but a third of it looks like it‚Äôs been rubbed off.

199,dogs,"TL;DR: Heavy 50kg 9 month mastiff puppy joins other fighting dogs and clamps his jaws and locks on, this can get us in a lot of trouble, and so currently looking into how to stop it - currently bought break stick and citronella spray, though considering e-collar (discussion about controversy below) and muzzle in hope to stop bite occurring. Please provide advice on other methods of training or prevention etc.

Hi All Thank you for this wonderful sub Firstly some more context on the issue, I have a puppy named Henry who's 9 months old, he's a mix between dogue de Bordeaux, boerboel, and Neapolitan mastiff, so is already 50kg. We go to a dog walking group, though in reality some 5-15 owners stand still and talk while their dogs run around playing. He gets on well with these dogs, will chase small and big dogs alike, then turn around and let them chase him etc - and has not shown aggression to any singular dog or attacked another dog. Though when any two dogs in the group start fight, be it resource guarding over a ball etc. (unfortunately there are two dogs there that does this often), Henry runs in from wherever he is and jumps in to the fight and bites down on one of the dogs, locks his jaws, and does not release - this can cause real distress for the owner, as it may have been a small fight that would have been short and have an obvious winner with little fallout, though now there dog is caught in the jaws of a very large powerful dog. He fortunately does not shake or try to cause any further destruction - just locks on. He has done this 2-3 times now, first time i managed to prise his jaw and this last time i had to stick my finger in his bum - not something me nor him wish to repeat. Currently my plan is to buy a break stick and citronella spray, with the approach of spraying it into his mouth with the hope that causes him to release, and if not use the break stick to force his mouth open. Then allowing me to pull him away, calm them down, and reintroduce them as to try an remove the chance of further future aggression. Though this is not sufficient, as this happens after he has already bitten them, i would like to stop it before it occurs. Currently I have the fallback of muzzling him, though i would like to avoid that as him and his brother like to wrestle, he likes to fetch, and they like to tug sticks - so use of his mouth is a large part of such play. Further to this there is the option of electric collars, while i understand these are controversial, my hope is to give him a warning noise when he first notices the fight and a zap if he proceeds to run towards it, as to create a negative association with other dogs fighting - i understand there could be misassociation, though this seems far less detrimental than what could happen if he is brandished dangerous, as the ultimate end is that he has to be castrated or put down. Though as he does not attack a dog that is not already in a fight, this seems to be an unfair outcome. I am against the general use of electric collars, though think there is a place for them, some breeds are very large and powerful and sometimes you must outwit the dog because you cannot physically control the dog. Though the owner must love the dog and use it judiciously, understanding that it is small and temporary pain to hopefully mean that greater pain such as castration or being put down is not necessary. Though I would be keen to hear how other people recommend i deal with the issue proactively, hopefully stopping Henry from ever getting involved - please give me your feedback.

202,dogs,"So we recently took home an 11 year old Bearded Collie because his owner passed away.

We‚Äôre also quite lucky that he doesn‚Äôt have any health issues and is super healthy overall. But there‚Äôs two main things I would like some advice on.

1. Since he‚Äôs an older dog, and he‚Äôs clearly grieving over the death of his owner, how can I best make him feel comfortable in his new home.

203,dogs,"I recently rescued a 2 yr old Great Pyrenees mix and it has been a month-long ride. She's my first dog and I've been dealing with separation anxiety, diarrhea, barking, pacing. I know physical exercise would help, but I can't exercise her too hard yet because she had heartworm treatment a few months ago at the rescue and we have wait a while for another test. I honestly can't wait to take her out hiking and for runs. But she gives me life in spite of it all and it's all so worth the wait and work. I had to put her on a bland diet for the diarrhea and the vet has given me trazodone to help with the anxiety and we are doing much better.

After she started the bland diet, she hadn't pooped for a couple days and I had such mommy brain. I was the one with anxiety for three days (while she was just hanging out and playing) until she had a poop that was so beautiful and healthy today. I never thought I would care this much about a dog's poop. 

Since I've gotten her, I've made so many mistakes (none super life threatening...like too much): I've accidentally given her chicken stock with onion (she was fine even with a call to the vet and animal poison control), the leash snapped once so I had to chase her around the block (we're definitely going to do recall training in January),  and she's put a small hole in my wall from anxious chewing (since sprayed the area with chewing repellant mix and working on getting her to chew her own toys).

Every day I hope I can give her the life she deserves and every day I'm like am I doing enough? I just wanted to share how happy I was about my dog pooping this morning and the progress we've made.

204,dogs,"**TL;DR** my 2 1/2 year old border collie/heeler has been displaying increasingly aggressive behavior towards only my girlfriend and seems increasingly more possessive of me as we have gotten closer as a couple. He‚Äôs starting to growl at her, lunge at her, and herd her. He can‚Äôt seem to settle around her unless I‚Äôm right next to him. I have no idea what to do, and need advice. 

So I‚Äôve had my dog for almost 18 months. He‚Äôs a 2 1/2 year old border collie/heeler mix who I adopted when he was 1 year old from a family that needed to rehome him because of his inability to get along with their other dog (an older blue heeler). My dog and I clicked instantly and I quickly became ‚Äúhis person‚Äù. 

6 months after I adopted him, I started dating my now-girlfriend. She has two children (7 and 5) who love playing with my dog and he very much enjoys the energy and activity he gets with them. My dog took a while to warm up to my girlfriend (like another 5-6 months, after we started dating really), but he soon came to love her and depend on her too and get excited to see her. She helped train him a lot too, helping teach him to be ‚Äúgentle‚Äù when taking treats and to not jump on people and to patiently sit down if he wants us to put a leash on him to go for a walk. 

Throughout all this time, however, he would be really possessive of me. When we all get home, I‚Äôm the first person he wants to say hi to and get pets from before he will greet anyone else. When my girlfriend and I sit on the couch to watch TV, he tries to squish his way in between us and has, on a few occasions, even tried to literally kick her off. 

If we hug or kiss, he runs over and jumps on her and tugs at her with his paws, like he‚Äôs trying to get her off me. When we all drive together, he pushes his snout in between us and lays it on the center console to try and get between us. We joke often that he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe ultimate cock-block‚Äù.

But recently, i moved into a new townhome. My girlfriend and the kids are moving in as well (in six months when her current lease is up). Things were fine at first, but over the last week or so, when we have both largely been spending a lot of time at home with the dog because of winter break, my dog has been displaying increasingly aggressive behavior - but only towards my girlfriend. 

He growls at her when she walks into the room. He paces around and can‚Äôt settle down with her around. He herds her around the house. It came to a head yesterday when she was sitting down to put shoes on and asked him if he wanted pets. *He* walked over to her, she started letting him and he started growling. She stopped and then suddenly he lunged at her face. I grabbed him and said ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù And put him in time out to try and keep them separated for him to calm down. Later, when I brought him out, he continued the growling and pacing and herding. This morning, I was in the shower (so he wasn‚Äôt even around me to try and ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me, which is what it previously seemed like he was doing)...and I get out of the shower to find out he was following her around the house and then randomly bit her hand. 

It‚Äôs really gotten quite scary and I feel bad because my girlfriend does so much to help take care of him and I don‚Äôt know what we can/should be doing to improve this. 

She always has asked him if he wants pets before she touches him, and always lets him approach her first. We have started separating *me* from him when he acts like this. If he tries to push in between us when sitting on the couch or if we hug, I say ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù, cross my arms and leave the room. To see were both suggested to me by a dog behavioralist we met with three months ago when this possessive behavior was continuing. 

But nothing seems to work and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to break his possessiveness of me. Is it a form of separation anxiety? He never whines or cries when I leave him. I don‚Äôt know why he is only displaying this aggressive behavior towards my girlfriend. He never does this to her two children, her roommate when we visit, or any of my immediate family members when we go to their house or they come over. 

Can anyone offer me any help? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to leave my dog, I don‚Äôt want to leave my girlfriend. I made commitments to both of them. But I don‚Äôt want my girlfriend to feel unsafe or unwelcome or uncomfortable in our home and around the dog. I also would hate for any of this behavior to ever extend towards the kids and risk someone getting hurt. 

I would be so grateful to get some advice, some encouragement, some words of comfort or explanation. Please, please, anything would help me right now. I love my dog so much, and he‚Äôs been with me through a lot and I feel like we have both helped each other in so many ways.

I feel so defeated and destitute and scared.",t2_iwm89,0,"My Dog is starting to display aggressively possessive behavior, but only towards my girlfriend.

207,dogs,"9 months ago I adopted the perfect dog. 

I doesn‚Äôt pee/poo in the house. He doesn‚Äôt destroy any of my stuff (even though I leave my stuff everywhere). He is friendly with all animals dogs/cats/rabbits and all people elderly/children. 

He doesn‚Äôt bark. He doesn‚Äôt instigate problems, when other dogs act aggressive to him he ignores it, except for the few occasions some tiny mutts rush him, he only gave a warning bark back. 

His only cons are that 1. He sheds a bit but I can manage 2. Washing him takes hours (he has a thick coat, takes approx 1 hour+ to wash and 1 hour+ to dry) 3. He is very independent/ not good motivated so it‚Äôs a bit hard to teach him tricks. 

As he is reaching close towards maturity we are planning to get him fixed. However I would love to get a second dog just like him. I don‚Äôt want to return to the original Breeder because I am suspecting she is an irresponsible breeder. I have see her making post selling different litters of puppies multiple times this year.

Name: Eggsy and he is chipped. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO SUE, GET PAYMENTS, DROP NAMES, HOLD ANYONE LIABLE. WE JUST WANT A PEACE OF MIND AND TO GET OUR DOG BACK IN ANY WAY. Pls call/text 516-402-0925 and 917-808-9347 for any info/ help, any is appreciated greatly. After posting on citizens app, we retrieved videos from eyewitnesses driving down Madison Ave where Eggsy ran to after running out of the hotel where the people who tried to help him brought him to. At the end he was seen laying on his side at East 34th St, Madison Ave at 8:45 P.M. 12/25/22. This person who sent the video also mentioned that a car stopped ahead of him and could have possibly picked him up but was not sure. Another person also reached out and said they were walking to Empire State Building and marked where they saw Eggsy which was the same spot of the video at 11:15 P.M. on 12/25/22. That person also mentioned that someone picked him up and placed him on the corner. Multiple people have reached out and contacted us saying they made 311 and 911 calls and reports hoping they can notify the owners who were possibly looking for the dog but we‚Äôre always redirected to sanitation, 24 hr animal emergency hospitals, or ACC, ASPCA. However, when we called and went to these places they all claimed that no one made a report or brought in a dog with Eggsy‚Äôs description. We went to the closest 24 hr emergency vet which my cousin also contacted previously located at 735 6th Ave and they said they got a call that same night on 12/25 about a white dog that was hit by a car in the same location we described and looks like it unfortunately didn‚Äôt make it and was not moving.  Another worker there confirmed that the call was about a Shiba Inu. We then called Dept of sanitation and they stated that when regular garbage collection resumed after the holiday (which was Tuesday) and they came at that area around 12 P.M., Eggsy‚Äôs was not there. With the possibility that they were lying and the workers didn‚Äôt file a report or said they didn‚Äôt see Eggsy and just threw him in the trash and cleaned the area just so they didn‚Äôt have to go through that process, Eggsy might be in a dumping location right now. We were able to see DOT footage of that area since there was a camera above but we were not allowed to see it directly. The DOT told us from what they saw an ambulance pulled up eventually and they didn‚Äôt know if they moved Eggsy‚Äôs body. We asked nearby stores to check their camera footage and they keep telling us ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking into it and will get back to you if we find something,‚Äù or ‚Äúcome back tomorrow/ next week when my manager/ property manager is here‚Äù. A lot of people like police, store owners, etc would say they‚Äôll help but just clearly don‚Äôt care or take it seriously where they might as well say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a dog‚Äù. 
      Someone might have taken Eggsy and tried to save him on the way and chances are he might be nursing back to some form of recovery or they were not successful and might have buried him. Either way, we want to make it clear that we are not looking to sue, get names, liability, anything. We just went a peace of mind and to hopefully get our dog back even if it‚Äôs his body because he at least deserves to be buried at home. Not in a random place or even worse, a dumping location. So please if anyone has him, or has tried to save him, or even dump him somewhere, please just let us know so we can get him back. We will not try to sue, get anyone in trouble, or drop names. Please spread this as much as possible. We are speaking with professional pet trackers and looking into ways to get this covered on news outlets and hopefully on TV right now.

So to start off, I always wanted a dog, and I used to remind that to my parents frequently when I was younger. Fast forward a few years later, my sister is born, she grows, she wants a dog too. Again fast forward, we got the dog, and from the start, shit is tumbling down. As per my mother's request, the person who primarily pushed my father to make that decision, the dog would be untrained, both to save money and to have it as a true member of the family. As you can already guess, that was not a good idea, but I, or should I say we, were too dumb to thing about it. The dog comes around, and we do treat it as member of the family. We give it love, food, hugs, kisses and pets, and the dog gave that love back. But a puppy isn't always going to be a puppy. The natural good behaviour of our dog started to slowly but surely fade, with her unusual intelligence, size and narcissistic behaviour steadily growing. Fast forward to the present day. My dog is a monster that, if not instructed by an adult it fears or loves will not do anything. Me and my sister are literally not able to touch it with both of our hands, because it thinks we are going to put it on a leash and get it on a walk, which it hates. A slow, steady growling will emerge as your hands approach her, which will evolve in a devastating flurry of vicious bites enchanted with pure hatred landing on your sorry skin.

213,dogs,"My 13 y/o neutered male Great Dane mix has been through a really rough year. In May, my husband left and took one of our 3 dogs with him. Then, in September, our other dog passed away very unexpectedly from a brain tumor. My husband worked from home full time before he left, so my sweet old boy went from 2 dog pack members and a human keeping him company all day, to being an only dog home by himself for hours at a time, all within a very short period of time. 

He went through a depressed few weeks shortly after his brother passing (I'm still beside myself), and has become very clingy to me. He's always had a little separation anxiety, but when we rescued him 6 years ago, he did really well being at home with his brother as his companion. This new version of clingy seems sadder and less about fear of being abandoned. He also is still in great health and shape for his age, but seems to be morose and has lost some of his personality (which was always a little high strung, easily excited, etc.). I'm struggling to identify this as grief/depression, loneliness, or signs of more rapidly aging after a stressful year. He has seemed excited when we've visited my parents and their dog. I also feel like I FINALLY saw a tiny spark of his old personality yesterday when my preteen son had a friend over. He went running down the hall after the boys and spent the whole day following them around with his tail wagging. It made me so happy to see that!

I refuse to get a puppy because my old boy does not need THAT kind of stress, but I'm considering adopting another adult dog to bring some joy and companionship back into the house. I am also looking at dog walkers in our area that could do home visits once a day (he would NOT go on a walk outside the home willingly with someone that is not me, but might enjoy a visitor... or maybe that would stress him out more - I have NO CLUE right now).

215,dogs,"Sorry upfront for formatting. I am also desperate for advice. So I moved in with my long-term boyfriend over a year ago. Things were great. Up until about three months ago. Baby started biting. Me and only me. According to boyfriend, this has never been an issue. Full story: boyfriend adopted Baby as a rescue. She wasn‚Äôt on the floor of the facility due to the fact that she was considered a ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù dog, but he wound up meeting her, and she responded to him better than she had ever responded to anyone ever. He had to take a class before they adopted her to him. This was about nine years ago (fwiw, age was not known when she was homed, but for sure very young). He and her were alone for the first couple years, but then he got into a serious relationship with a woman, and that lasted six years. They broke up. I met them afterwards and we started our relationship. She LOVED me. Super excited when I entered the apartment. Always cuddling. Then one day something changed. She is still always eager to see me. We snuggle and I give her pets and I give her treats. But she started tearing up all of my underwear. Then one day, she bit me. Not super hard, but still. She did it two more times in relatively close succession. Then she stopped for a bit. But tonight, right before I started typing this post, she did it again. For full context, she was in my spot of the bed, and I was coming in from another room, so I said hi to her, and I pet her and talked to her a little bit (‚Äúoh hi bb! You look so comfy! I‚Äôm sorry, I gotta scooch you over a little bit‚Äù). This is by no means uncommon. She likes to lay in the spots that are where my bf and I sleep. We have a California King, and she sleeps with us every night. She will literally lay on our pillows, so we move her and lay in our spots, then she comes back over and lays anywhere she wants. Even if that is on top of us, or where our legs are. Anyway, there‚Äôs some background. Tonight though, I went to the kitchen to get some water, and when I came back she was in my spot. So I tried to do the sweet thing where I moved her over in a comfy-for-her way, and she bit me. Pretty hard, to be honest. Not bleeding, but bruising for sure. This is the fourth time. And she‚Äôs started taunting, too. Where she bares her teeth, and growls, as though if I get any closer then there will be consequences. Idk, I‚Äôm just scared. I love Baby, and she is bf‚Äôs bff. I have had dogs all my life. She is a pit bull boxer mix, and I have had boxers like 95% of my life. She has never been hostile towards any human other than me. What do I do?

216,dogs,"We're in Canada, and our girl has petite feet, which means her feet get cold after a certain amount of time outside in the snow. She LOVES the snow, and she doesn't mind her hurta jacket when it gets cold, and doesn't mind her booties either usually.

We've started off with muttluks, which are great and all, but the top opening is big on her and the snow falls into her boot. We want to avoid the snow touching her as she excessively licks her feet due to allergies. We have ruffwear shoes for the times when the pavement is hot in summer, as well as little socks, but again the same issue of the snow touching her leg, which then she excessively licks when we get inside. We tried WalkeePaws... but since our girl is a mutt, the little boots were too big and baggy on her, and the smaller size wouldn't have fit her height. 

So now we're back to ground 0, and I'm looking at other boots to try!

218,dogs,"Hi all. On Monday, my 13 year old dog had a vet visit &amp; we were told he most likely has melanoma in his top gums as a ~1inch lump. Weve been told theres not much we can do except pain management till its the end ( prescribed inflammation &amp; pain meds )But hes been having trouble breathing through his nose at night &amp; its a hit or miss if he sleeps well. I feel so terrible for him- i havent been able to fall asleep until he does. Tonights the first night he wasnt able to sleep much at all; I bought a humidifier for him but I cant tell if its helping. His nose lightly drips watery blood throughout the day &amp; rarely he‚Äôll sneeze up some more. He eats pretty good but started slowing down on his meals a little bit yesterday.

Hes still a very happy boy considering the circumstances. Always wagging his tail &amp; getting the zoomies. He drinks a lot of water too. No problems with urinating or shitting either. Doesnt seem to be in pain with or without the meds so I give a low dose of his Gabapentin every 12hrs just in case because I know its hard to tell if some dogs are in pain.

I guess my question is- how will I know when its time to put him down? How can I tell if hes suffering?

My dog is 7 (nearly 8) years old and shes been on very very little walks throughout her life. She‚Äôs sick and hates the outside world, she‚Äôs scared of anything and everything outside and hates the feel of grass - she pulls the lead away from it and wont stand to go onto it, she has fibrosis and vets have told us to limit her running or it can be a health risk. Before her sickness got worse, she still hated going out and often hid to try to stay in bed, she has no trauma of the outdoors and loves to travel but she hates actually walking. My dog gets completely spoiled 24/7 and is kept as healthy as we can get her, she absolutely loves her life even if she‚Äôs not active and has a condition limiting her, it‚Äôs not constantly hurting her and I‚Äôve denied vets from putting her down.

225,dogs,"After 9 months of trying with a dog I rescued, I just couldn't do it anymore. I adopted ""Riley"" back in March, and he was so mild mannered in the shelter. But when I brought him home, he was an absolute nightmare - excessive barking, chewing up everything I owned, playing biting, and just wouldn't leave me alone. The behavior started getting better, but then after I came back from a week long trip, it got worse. I tried training, taking him to a vet, meds, special toys, exercise... nothing was making his behavior better. There was some progress, but by that point, I had nothing left in my emotional gas tank and was running out of money. And every time he would bark, it would fry my nerves. I also have 2 herniated discs, so that didn't make things easier.

I kept persisting because I loved him so much. He loved people and other dogs. He'd do a little frog squat and want to play. 

I started to a special training with him every day. But I'd still cry every day. But it was taking a huge toll on my mental health. I wasn't getting any sleep because of the barking. My whole life was devoted to Riley. I couldn't watch tv, cook, do anything without him starting his barking. I'd hide in my bathroom a lot. Sometimes, I'd hide in my car. I think I even slept there one day. 

My family sat me down and told me they could see what it was doing to me. They told me I'm clearly not ok.  So I finally made the call. 

I returned him to the shelter, and it wrecked me. At first, the people there were a little judgy and didn't seem to understand. But they could see he was well taken care of, and this was my last resort. And that he was a good boy deep down inside. And yet, when we put him in the kennel, I started crying and regretting my decision. I asked them if he'll be ok and if they'll take good care of him. The lady said he'll be ok.  As I walked away, he looked at me with his floppy ears, scared and confused. I sobbed in the car and came home to an empty house. He was a nightmare, but he was MY nightmare. 

So I'm wondering if anyone else went through this. I feel like a shitty person. I also feel like I'm going through a breakup, which coincidentally is also happening. Right now, I feel so alone.

226,dogs,"Basically my cousins have had their dog, Mina, for a few years now, 3 years or so. She is really cute and is a Jack Russell, she's never grown up with other puppies or dogs or anything like that so... When I got my puppy Kaya, a mini poodle, I thought she would have a lot of fun with Mina and they would play and stuff. Instead Mina attacks Kaya whenever she even gets near the toys, let alone play with them. Doesn't even let Kaya get near Kaya's own toys OR food bowl, having to go out in the hallway for Kaya to peacefully eat. Kaya is just kinda laying around all day and I feel kind of bad just seeing as Mina is playing around with all the toys and Kaya is watching. It's not like Mina doesn't want to play or be friends with Kaya either. When Kaya is bored and has nothing to do she runs around and stuff and Mina would chase her around and try to play, but since Kaya has been attacked by Mina, Kaya would kinda back away because she would be too scared. (Note: We're staying over at my cousins for one more week so I can't just go or wait)

238,dogs,"Hello everyone. First off, a short story.

I just got a booster shot (Speeda) now due to a scratch that I got from my own dog last Friday (23 December 2022) when I was trying to feed her. No bleeding, just reddish marks. It was gone now. The nurse (if you call them that) at the animal bite center that I visited and whom I got my first shots (yes, I already got vaccine shots for 6 times now) said that even though there were no signs of open wound, and despite me telling her that the dog isn't acting weird, I still should get a booster shot. The dog that scratched me had her last shot on September of 2021, and still hasn't updated her vaccination status. Although, the dog is caged and our place is on a subdivision, where there aren't a lot of dogs outside. My country is in the Philippines if it helps, and we are located in an urbanized area (Manila).

There are some bugging questions in my mind though.

1. From what I have read, infected dogs (or any other animals infected for that matter) are the only ones who can transmit the virus to humans. My first question is, can a dog that doesn't exhibit any signs of the virus transmit it? 
2. My dog only scratched me, and it isn't even an open wound. My second question is, can the virus be transmitted even though there were no open wounds, only scratches? 
3. This last (double) question is only brought by my own paranoia. Can the anti-rabies vaccine (the small amount of inactivated rabies virus) cause rabies to the person being inoculated? Also, can a rabies virus be inoculated?",t2_emiskm07,0,Bugging questions in my mind with regards to the rabies virus and the anti-rabies vaccine,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zy1a48,True,simon_026,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zy1a48/bugging_questions_in_my_mind_with_regards_to_the/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zy1a48/bugging_questions_in_my_mind_with_regards_to_the/,2476290,1672306561,0,,False,1672306575,1672306575,2022-12-29 09:36:01,,,,,,,

241,dogs," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs

* I‚Äôve had dogs my whole life 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

*Prefer rescuing dogs but I usually get dogs from reputable breeders. I do know a Labrador breeder and a cane corso breeder. I also have a relative who is a toy poodle breeder that has puppies that are almost ready for adoption. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

*Affectionate, trainable, fluffy, low shedding if possible, etc

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*Toy poodles and papillons. Both have traits I want in a dog. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*Basic dog commands like sit, lay down, paw, roll over, stay, leave it, and spin. Also potty train them and any other needed training. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

*No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* As much time as needed. I have a lot of free time 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

*Depends. I‚Äôm fine with walking a dog daily, maybe an hour for that. I‚Äôll also often play with the puppy. I don‚Äôt know about dog parks since I‚Äôve heard bad things about them, but my aunt has a good dog park near her house so I might take the dog there.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* As much as needed. I do plan on learning to groom dogs at home since dog grooming can be expensive and we don‚Äôt have any good dog groomers nearby. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

*More on the smaller side

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Im looking for a low shedding dog. Barking is annoying but it‚Äôs not a huge deal. I prefer less slobber

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Its very important for me. I will do off-leash training with my dog

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Aside of potty training in the cold why people prefer to have puppies in the summer?
 Isn't it that the worst scenario when socialising a small puppy? - lots of stimuli, cyclists, parks are full of people and dogs and then you have the 7-10 month teenage phase when it's snowy and cold and you can't take your dog for very big walks etc. 

Would it be better to wait for fall/winter puppy so we can start socialising slowly (anyway also the puppy will need less physical exercise outside compared to when it's 9 month old) and then puppy grows to its crazy stage right about when spring/summer comes so we can spend more time in the park etc?

Hi guys, not sure if this violates any rules. I just wanna tell my best boy's story. Content waring: gun violence and animal cruelty 

2 days before Christmas, my door wasnt shut all the way. My door has an automated lock. The wind was terrible, and we think it wasnt shut all the way, so we are pretty sure it got blown open. 

My dogs of course got out. They arent really dog aggressive. Draco, my pittie, is the most loving dog ever. All he wants to do is say hi. My other dog, Shadow, is very protective of Draco. She isnt dog agressive but will defend him if necessary. The my dogs saw two other dogs in a fenced in yard. It is unclear if they were trying to attack them or just play with them, as no one saw them. 

When my boyfriend woke up and noticed what happened, he jumped in his car and drove around the neighborhood. Seeing shadow, he opened the car door and she jumped right in. A person with a gun banging on a house door saw this and approached him. When the guy found out shadow was was ours, he told my boyfriend he had shot Draco. My boyfriend was able to quickly locate my injured dog and rushed him to the ER. Later we found out the guy called animal control on us for our dogs being off leash. 

Ultimately, the wound was best case scenario. The bullet went through cleanly. It missed any bones and organs. Draco is alive and healing. 

I fully believe Draco got shot rather than Shadow because he is a pit. He is big and loud. And this guy had no connection to the property the dogs were trying to get onto. He also told animal control that my dog charged him. This doesnt make any sense because my dog got shot on the side of the back leg.

Now, I need help. The initial ER visit was 2600$ alone. We are drowning in vet bills and want to pursue legal action. I dont need anybody to donate to us. Im asking for resources.

262,dogs,"My dog is an 8 week old, 16ish pound rottweiler mix puppy. we live in ontario with two cats and one other dog
My grandmothers purebred rottie has ran off and gotten pregnant for the second time now. Since it was the holidays, ive always wanted a big dog, and we were looking for a guard dog anyways, we decided to take one in. 
I like to plan things out in my notes, so ive been writing stuff down i might want/need to do with him, things to buy him, etc. which has naturally brought up a bunch of questions. Ill ask my vet these things when i go, but for now im asking the internet

1. his size/diet. how big will he get? his mother is huge, like easily over 100 pounds, and his (suspected) dad is a little thinner/taller. he has a really blocky head, and most strays here are GSD/husky looking, probably 70-100 pounds. he likes to stand up and put his paws on my shoulders, and when he does that hes nearly eyelevel with me (im 5') I ask this because i bought him royal canins large breed puppy food but i checked on the back of the bag when i got home and it says its for dogs with an estimated adult weight of 57 to 97 pounds. Should i switch to the giant breed puppy food? and is royal canins puppy food good? should i just give him their Rottweiler puppy food???

2. neutering. when will he be fully grown? google says rotties can take 3 years to be fully grown. does that matter in regards to when we neuter him? 

3. embark products. should i get a breed and health test? they also have supplements, should i start giving him those preemptively or wait to talk to the vet or wait to see the health test? 

4. activities. ive been looking at agility, weight pulling, hiking, weighted vests, bitework, spring poles, and dock diving. i probably wont end up doing half of them but in case i do, when can i start? are these things safe for him to do? 

5. coat care. what kind of shampoo should i use? deshedding shampoo, flea and tick control, etc? rn we just have mane and tail. how many brushes do i need? i see these videos of people using like 3 brushes. slicker brush, equigroomer, metal comb, etc. should i get those? how often should i brush him? for how long? also should i get nose and paw balm? i dont want him to dry out. and should i brush his teeth every day? with what? should i just take him to a groomer?

6. what collar? there are so many. i was looking at fur savers. mom was looking at prong collars but those make me nervous. theres also choke chains which are scary, but would it be fine to use one once hes fully leash trained and doesnt pull? they look kinda cool. also those ones that only get a little tighter? is nylon better than leather? i also want to get him used to head halters, harnesses, and muzzles.

7. chewing. what chews are best? a lady told me i shouldnt give him pig ears while hes this young. also we have anti chew spray, which seems to be working, is that alright? i just sprayed our shoes 

8. outside dog. my mom wants to keep him outside once hes bigger, at least while im not home. is this okay? should i convince her to let him stay in the house? at least once he has better manners? our smaller dog is allowed in the house. if we do end up doing that, which way would be best? invisible fence, real fence, chain, or those aerial tie out things?",t2_lvwh3lsr,0,new puppy questions,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,spoiler,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,True,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zxwpaq,True,heavenlypal,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxwpaq/new_puppy_questions/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxwpaq/new_puppy_questions/,2476244,1672291122,0,,False,1672291133,1672291134,2022-12-29 05:18:42,,,,,,,

264,dogs,"My next door neighbor has had a dog for the past 3ish years. It‚Äôs a small poodle crossed with who knows what, and it is neglected. My neighbor came over last night and asked me if I would let his dog out for a few days as he was going to be gone. I said sure, as me and my neighbor have been friendly since I‚Äôve lived here (4 years at least). He told me he lets him out every 8ish hours for 10 minutes. 

I found out that besides potty breaks, this dog is locked in a cold, cement basement that has no light. The owner feeds him CAT food. The dogs hair is so long, curly and matted that he can barely even see. The dog is not neutered, and I‚Äôm unsure about his vaccines. Obviously my heart breaks for him and I want to help. I‚Äôve known the dog since my neighbor got him because we shared a backyard at that point. It seemed like he was taken care of OK in the summer because he is outside 24/7 but I never got to really see him during the winter. The dog loves me and is so happy when I go to let him out. I can‚Äôt bare to have him locked up in a basement like that. (We also live in MN when it‚Äôs been 5 degrees the past week, and cement basements are cold as hell!) 

My dilemma: my boyfriend wants to ask the neighbor if we could keep the dog. Tonight we brought it over, trimmed its face, gave him a bath, and he‚Äôs sleeping in a warm bed. (My neighbor would be completely fine with this as I‚Äôve had the dog over before.) Problem is, we already have 3 dogs. 2 shitzu mixes, and a 6 month black lab. We do have a fenced in yard, but the house is already chaotic as it is. I know that a 4th dog is going to be too hard for me to handle. I‚Äôm primary caretaker for the dogs since my boyfriend works longer hours. But I desperately want to help the dog. My boyfriend is in love with the dog, and already says ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt keep the dog, I‚Äôm calling the police!‚Äù I know the police can‚Äôt do anything about it. The dog has food, water and shelter.

I've always dreamed of having a pup, but thought it would be better to wait until our kids are older so it would be less stressful.

Our youngest is great with her grandma's dogs (pitbulls) and uncle's dog (corgi) so I'm not worried about her being too young to be respectful with a puppy.

Reasons he's protesting:
1. They die. His parent's dogs and cat passed away and it was hard for him. Made him not want to ever own a pup.

2. Fear of poop being scattered all over our 1acre backyard.

3. Money. Doesn't want another mouth to feed, worry about vet costs and additional expenses.

We're a one income family and I'm a student. 

I plan to graduate with my bachelor's December 2023. That's it for school for me. 
If I get my masters it'll be some years from now. 

We have a house with a fully fenced yard. We have a trail behind our house that is 1 mile, perfect for walks. 

Our house is 70% wood floors, 30% carpet. 

Our upstairs bedrooms are all wood floors. 

I'm an online student. 

Also have a remote internship and am hoping to land a permanent position with the company I am interning with, which would be full time but fully remote still!

My kids all really want a dog too. 

I plan on adopting from a rescue so spay or neuter surgery is covered. 

I grew up with 2 dogs and they were my best friends.
The hardest part about moving out was not having my little shadow with me constantly (family dog stayed at my mom's) and not having a pup to greet me with love when I came in the door.

My hopes:
Get a puppy when I graduate next December, or a little earlier. I have about $6000 saved now and plan on having at least $10000 saved by then.

I am looking to adopt a puppy Dachshund and have found a breeder localish to me in Utah but I am afraid they don‚Äôt pass all the ethical breeding checks.

None the less, I have already reached out to the breeders on that list that are on the western side of the US. 

While I wait to hear back about their upcoming litters I found this local Utah breeder. On their website they appear to have a great story and tons of detailed information about their health and vaccine regimes for their puppies. But when looking at a potential pup to adopt I noticed two things. One, only the mother has pedigree documentation posted, and two, they only list the parent‚Äôs Embark DNA test results. There is no mention of anything relating to OFA exams, which is what I‚Äôve come to understand as the gold standard for ethical breeder health testing.

269,dogs,"Long story short - is buying a second dog a good idea or is it better to have only one dog at a time??
 
My partner and I own a one year old mini poodle. He is a pretty good dog - exceptionally high energy but well behaved for the most part and very loving. He definitely gave us a run for our money as a new puppy though haha! 

We had been toying with the idea of getting a second dog next year (2023) and had reached out to our breeder in October to express interest about a possible puppy from a future litter. She let us  know our current dogs sibling (from and older litter) had just had puppies that would be ready for their homes early December - she picked one she thought would suit us best and sent lots of photos for us to consider. We spent a lot of time discussing it but ultimately decided to not go ahead. 

Over Christmas we looked after a friends dog and it went very well, our dog seemed to love the company and was pretty sookie after they left. My partner and I were feeling pretty regretful that we didn‚Äôt buy the puppy.

We went to several vets and the hospital, they have prescribed several medicines, all to be given to him via saline/inject in his veins, this incident has caused me a lot of distress emotionally and mentally, my dad was closest to our pet Lhasa and he has been extremely disturbed and saddened by this incident, this has caused arguments and fights between us, my dad wasn‚Äôt there when this incident happened, it was only me and my mom. 

We are not sure about his vision recovery from the eye that got hurt. This is very painful, since my dad is blaming us, which is justified, I was distracted while I was closing the car door and didn‚Äôt even notice he was there present near the door.

271,dogs,"Our oldest dog has been showing her age both physically and mentally for awhile now, but recently I've become concerned for her safety at night. To the point of sleeping on the floor downstairs to be near her.

She has cataracts which has resulted in night blindness. I've noticed that she becomes confused and disoriented at night, part of this is due to her limited vision but her vet also suspects some form of dementia. 

She will growl, bark, and occasionally run at both people and other animals in low light. She is also prone to snapping when first waking up and will not respond to her name or commands during an episode of confusion (she is now on medication but I find it makes her groggy and saps her energy during the day). We started keeping our other dog and cats seperate at night, talking calmly when we come downstairs, and I've installed nightlights around the house for her. I'm not sure if they give her any better visuals of us, but it allows her a path to follow between her bed and water dish at night (though she still occasionally runs into the doorway or trips over something).

I recently had to remove our rugs due to her having night time accidents. Her back end has nerve damage which prevents her from holding her waste when she has a spasm or is sleeping. She will wake up, but that just means she is walking while defecating. Unfortunately removing the rugs presented another issue: she is petrified of the wood floors. She panics when walking on them which then causes her to slip and slide all over the place; crashing into things, knocking her bottom around, falling over... It is pitiful. When she is particularly sore I will carry her between her bed and dishes or the back door now, but she is a 50lbs dog and does NOT like being picked up... I tried putting down a line of door matts but she sometimes drags her back leg, which then gets caught on the matt and causes her to trip and panic.

Despite this, she is still a surprisingly active dog and has recently (for the first time ever) began escaping from our yard at night by jumping the fence and not coming when called. We have a dealership near us with a large flood light and she ... just goes and stands under it? She has never done this before and I'm terrified she will get hit by a car. 

During the day she is happy, playful, accident free, and sweet. But at night I fear for her safety and others. I'm hoping that if anyone else has any experience with this they might have tips for making my home safer for everyone and more comfortable for her?",t2_japiwbpd,0,Senile Senior Proofing Home?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zxvrd2,True,Mama_Bear-Love,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxvrd2/senile_senior_proofing_home/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxvrd2/senile_senior_proofing_home/,2476221,1672288402,0,,False,1672288415,1672288415,2022-12-29 04:33:22,,,,,,,

I got my boy almost 2 months ago, off the bat we connected. He‚Äôs 4 years old and he‚Äôs an aussie chow. 

For the first month and a half he‚Äôs been the happiest/cuddliest boy ever. When I turn off my light to go to bed he hops on it because he knows its bed time. He lays on the mat while i‚Äôm using the bathroom. Etc. 


Strangely, this past week all of it has stopped? 

He still follows me everywhere but it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt want me touching him, he lays at a different location in the same room. 
He doesn‚Äôt lay in the bathroom with me anymore however he does check up when i first go in there but he immediately turns around. 
His tail seems to be wagging less? 

These past two nights he‚Äôs been laying under the bed (thats his ‚Äúspot‚Äù) and not hopping on to my bed when its bed time and when i peak under the bed and say ‚Äúcome here November‚Äù he gives that avoiding eye contact uncomfortable look dogs do.. 
but while I‚Äôm sleeping, he hops on the bed?‚Ä¶ 
And speaking of ignore, hes been doing that suddenly lately as well in general. 

Am I over thinking it? I‚Äôm getting a bit sad, he just seems really annoyed of me now..

290,dogs,"Hey all! My wife &amp; I are spending a substantial amount of time researching breeds that would work well for our lifestyle and current living situation, and would really appreciate some input to help steer our decision making! Thanks in advance :) 

 **Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   1. Wife's first dog, but I grew up with a black lab. My mom and I did puppy training classes, but she ended up being primarily responsible for training (I was \~9 at the time). 
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   1. We have a strong preference for a reputable breeder being relatively new dog owners. 
3. Describe your ideal dog.
   1. Family-friendly (we have a baby nephew)
   2. Moderately-high activity level (live in 2BR apartment but like taking long walks, have multiple dog-friendly parks nearby, and regularly go to the family cottage year-round) 
   3. Medium or med-large breed (fairly small apartment, but love larger dogs) 
   4. Less inclined to bark 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   1. Labrador Retriever - I'm biased due to experience, but also stellar reputation as all-around family companion dogs 
   2. Mini/Standard Poodle - Have taken care of a poodle &amp; boarded a mini bernedoodle together and have really enjoyed the experience 
   3. Wheaten Terrier - recommended by a friend, and the few we've met have been very agreeable, but seem to have a reputation online for being high-maintenance
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   1. Most interested in really solid fundamentals (recall, sit/down/stay, fetch, heel) but could also be fun to continue with tricks down the line. 
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   1. No particular interest, nor any experience. 

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   1. We both WFH and can pretty regularly take breaks to train, play with, or go for potty breaks. I'd estimate this as 3h devoted time, with one/both of us frequently being around the house. 
2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   1. Minimum 1h/day, in practice (when boarding/dog-sitting) more like 1.5-2h per day. Mix of walks/runs on leash plus \~30 mins at dog park (social time, fetch, etc.) 
3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   1. I'm accustomed to weekly brushing and ear cleaning (with my old lab) and we'd be open to learning any additional grooming techniques, but we'd be willing to pay a groomer if it were necessary. 

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?
   1. Medium to medium-large breed 
2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   1. Good with shedding, would prefer less natural inclination towards barking &amp; slobbering. 
3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   1. Would eventually love to let the dog off-leash at the cottage, but that's something we'd really want to work towards as a reward for mastering recall. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   1. We would quite enjoy being able to snuggle with a dog, but it would also be ideal if they were okay with some alone time (especially while we're working). 
2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?
   1. We definitely lean more towards eager-to-please/responds well to training and games. 
3. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   1. It would be best if the dog didn't go crazy when someone came in the door.  We would like them to be comfortable around strangers/visitors as we like hosting, but want to train them not to jump up on them.
4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   1. We want to socialize &amp; train our dog not to be aggressive to other dogs, as we would like to take them to the dog park, on hikes, etc. 
5. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?
   1. We want to avoid excessive barking, and would like to socialize &amp; train them not to be aggressive towards cats as my wife's sisters both have cats.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   1. At least one of us will be home almost every day, though we may both be out perhaps 3 times per week for 3-4 hours each time. Eventually, it'd be nice to have a 6-8 hour window. 
2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   1. Just my wife &amp; I! We understand the importance of consistent training/care and will both be significantly involved. 
3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
   1. We don't have other pets and don't plan on getting others, but we do get together with my wife's sisters once a month or so, and they have cats.
4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   1. Similarly, while we don't have kids, there are babies in the extended family, and we live in a family neighbourhood.
5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   1. We are currently renting and expect to be for the foreseeable future.  No restrictions on the lease though, and there are other dogs in the building.
6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   1. We live in Toronto, Canada. Our province has a pretty broad pit bull ban. 
7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   1. Winters average around -5C (23F), and summers average around 22C (73F), though we see occasional bouts of extreme cold (-20C/-4F) or heat (32C/90F) .

292,dogs,"We have a four month old aussie puppy which is double merle so he is deaf and partially blind. Not only am I getting a cert in dog training but we also have private sessions with a dog trainer for him. He‚Äôs extremely smart. He does have some separation anxiety but only when it comes to me and resource guards food and bones which I have been working with him on and he‚Äôs gotten to the point where he doesn‚Äôt resource guard with me and sometime with my husband.

My husband and I also have a three year old. Now I have always been the type who is strict on kids and people in general really leaving dogs alone when they‚Äôre eating or have bones/chews regardless on if they resource guard or not. My thought process is that they‚Äôre still dogs and are capable of biting. My husband is less strict on it. I think he‚Äôs partly spoilt by our other dog who doesn‚Äôt resource guard at all and he thinks he has a sense for if a dog is going to bite or not. It‚Äôs always been a source of conflict between us because I am well aware how quickly a dog‚Äôs behavior can shift.

Well, I needed to clean my daughter‚Äôs room so I had my husband in the living room with our two dogs and our daughter watching cartoons. Part of encouraging our puppy out of separation anxiety is by rewarding him when he‚Äôs quiet and calm when I‚Äôm not around. I explicitly told my husband to watch our daughter and puppy closely and to not let her near him and to feed him the treats (in this case just kibble) from him hand, not to toss them on the floor. I come out from the room and my daughter is on the floor near our puppy while he is snacking on some kibble. I scold my husband for it and he replies that our puppy has been very calm. Right as I was telling him to separate them, my daughter leans in closer and gets bit in the face. She got a gash on her upper lip that needed stitches. 

At first, in the heat of the moment as we‚Äôre gathering our daughter up in the car to bring her to the emergency room, anger is clouding my husband and all he can do is blame our puppy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was angry at our puppy too but I also don‚Äôt blame our puppy. From the get go, in the car I‚Äôm sobbing and just asking my husband why he doesn‚Äôt just listen to me. I work with dogs. I‚Äôve worked with aggressive dogs and I‚Äôve worked with dogs that resource guard. I‚Äôve worked with dogs that are injured and stressed. I would have to say that I probably have more knowledge on puppy training and dog behavior than he does. At the beginning emotions are running high and all he can do is be angry at our puppy and was even offended at me asking him why he doesn‚Äôt listen to me. 

A few hours into our hospital visit he starts to calm down. Even though I was asking him why he didn‚Äôt listen, I wasn‚Äôt going about it in a way that was meant to guilt because accidents do happen and I told him such. My daughter‚Äôs hurt herself before because I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention. My husband had time to think and he did apologize to me and said he should have listened to me and that he will always now when it comes to dogs. 

The whole time at the hospital was horrible. My daughter is getting stitches and will always have a scar on her face and I‚Äôm telling my husband not to talk to me because in the moment I feel like I‚Äôm backed into this corner because I love this puppy but all I can see now is my daughter‚Äôs face being bitten and thinking ‚Äòwhat if it had been her eye? what if he was fully grown?‚Äô. So I felt like I was being put in this impossible position of possibly having to rehome my puppy because my husband didn‚Äôt listen to me. I was genuinely thinking that I had to despite the fact that the bite wasn‚Äôt my puppy‚Äôs fault. But my daughter comes first always. I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to protect my daughter because I was on the other side of the couch. 

Surprisingly my husband is the one who said we should keep our puppy. He admits the bite is fully his fault and that he feels terrible because I told him to keep an eye on them and be careful and told him twice just seconds before she got bit to move her away from him. I don‚Äôt want him to carry guilt over this because accidents truly do happen but I am relieved that I‚Äôm not being pressured to give our puppy up. 
 
But I am still wondering if I am making the right choice. I am fully aware that our puppy isn‚Äôt at fault and laid down stricter rules that I am sure my husband will follow after this but those what ifs keep running through my head.

I‚Äôm not going to say this to my husband because I genuinely don‚Äôt want him to feel worse about the situation but I am so angry that I‚Äôve been put in this situation.",t2_7ymhe173,0,Angry and scared,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zxrooh,True,cvttle,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxrooh/angry_and_scared/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxrooh/angry_and_scared/,2476189,1672277469,0,,False,1672277484,1672277485,2022-12-29 01:31:09,,,,,,,

294,dogs,"hello all! 
i have a puppy (9 months old). when i got her i had a loft bed (i have a very small room, a curtain for a door, no window, can just barely fit a twin sized bed,  i had the loft bed so i could fit a proper desk in my room while still having space when i had online school). Puppy since day one was sleeping in my room. i had set her up with pee pads and her bed on my floor, first few nights i even slept on the floor with her!! next month or so i would sleep with my head hanging out the side of the bed so she could see me and sleep. after a month of me getting no sleep because i was constantly getting up to make sure she was okay i decided to get a bed on the floor, as well as a smaller desk since i‚Äôve graduated and have less use for one. she stayed sleeping there for a bit until she discovered my mothers room, which is much bigger than mine with a giant window she likes to stare out of. she‚Äôs been sleeping in my moms bed ever since. we‚Äôve tested to see if it‚Äôs the person or the bed (we just had to lol) by switching rooms for the night, puppy remained in moms bed for the night with me in it (looked a little confused but got in bed and went to sleep regardless). every night she comes to my room after i go to bed and looks at me like she wants to sleep in my room and then leaves, and every morning gets out of bed and comes to cuddle in my bed. my mom is also sick of her sleeping in her room too. i think my question is what is her problem üòÇüòÇ is the room too small for her? she‚Äôs not big she‚Äôs 20lbs, how do i pinpoint why she doesn‚Äôt like my room and if it‚Äôs something i can fix?",t2_4te86mw0,0,dog doesn‚Äôt like my room?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zxrc4a,True,asardinesandwich,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxrc4a/dog_doesnt_like_my_room/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxrc4a/dog_doesnt_like_my_room/,2476184,1672276579,0,,False,1672276597,1672276598,2022-12-29 01:16:19,,,,,,,

He howls even if I keep him locked in the house. Needless to say, this has been disturbing neighbors and the people who live below me. Any ideas how I can stop the howling?

300,dogs,"**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**
this will be my fourth dog. my childhood dog was an American Eskimo, who i had from age 5ish to 20ish when he passed away. i then helped train and raise my parents' two shelter dogs before i moved out. (we got them as puppies, they are large mixes. we think one is aussie/gsd/spaniel and the other is a small bit pit bull/jack russell/retriever, but we aren't sure at all) 


**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**
prefer going to a breeder; love my parent's shelter dogs, but we were definitely caught off-guard by how challenging their unpredictable temperaments were.


**3) Describe your ideal dog.**
my ideal dog was my American Eskimo, but i struggle to consider the breed again as i only see him when i look at them, and it breaks my heart. he was small, smart, loving, funny, gentle, a little bit noisy (but respected being instructed to stop), and in his adult years was very laid-back -- he matched the energy of the household. (as a puppy, bundle of energy!) 

my ideal dog would be similar! i have a lot of patience for puppies, but i can't handle longterm destructive behavior (that's to say, with my persistent and consistent training, and with regular exercise, i need my dog by 2 years old to be able to be trusted home alone for, say, 4 hours on a date night.) i also live in an apartment, dog friendly with pretty thick walls, but you can hear the neighbor dog barking when he's right at the door. we will probably be in apartments for the foreseeable future, so while i don't require a quiet dog perse, i do want a dog who has the capacity to be trained to cease barking on command when needed. 

my partner and i both work from home and are home bodies, but we also are fairly active. he runs every day and i tend to exercise at home. we are adaptable to breeds that need daily runs, but we would also prefer a breed that slows down a bit in adulthood. 


**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**
so, my partner is not very dog breed knowledgeable. i was a little obsessed as a child, on the other hand, so there's many i adore but know the temperament wouldn't work well with me. he seemed to keep naming beautiful but notoriously challenging spitz breeds, like huskies, shiba inu, jindo. i veto'd these because i know we would never be able to handle the amount of energy they come with.

i like cocker spaniels, westies, pomeranians -- small dogs with sweet faces, who can be a little lazy with me every now and then. but these were veto'd as he doesn't like the hound or terrier faces, and he's been biased against poms per seeing so many yappy untrained ones.

the compromise we are looking at now is the Alaskan Klee Kai. the size is much preferable to me against huskies or jindos, they have the look that he loves... but, i read conflicting notes on their temperaments and exercise needs. it's important to me that my dog is able to be calm and laidback over time. it's ok if they need rigorous exercise for a couple hours every day, and i 100% would play with my dog every day, but in between i need my household to have some peace. i would describe this as a dog who does not initiate play the second they are awake from every little nap, all day long. and, a dog who is capable of entertaining themselves if i decline to play, and won't manifest that energy into destructive behavior. knowing this is majorly connected to how well we train that dog, will a Klee Kai be capable of relaxing? 



**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**
cease barking on command, basic obedience (sit, stay), train against food aggression, train to not jump on visitors, housebreaking (my boyfriend wants to train the dog to use an actual toilet... haha, maybe!), and would also like to train the dog to do some fun tricks (rolling over, shaking, play dead, the usual suspects)

this is a companion dog, and not a working dog! 


**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**
no experience with any of this. the dog will not be used for work, but boyfriend has interest in agility training. this is not a priority. 


Care Commitments

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**
we are good for at least 3 to 4 hours of dedicated training, play and exercise time per day. we are at home all day, so this is highly flexible and we're ready to dedicate a lot of our time to the puppy. i think, as the puppy matures, the *dedicated* time might lessen to 2 - 3 hours, however. 


**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? **
always, at least 1 hour per day. sometimes, up to 2 hours in a day. we are planning to take the dog with us on runs and walks, and take them out on trips to socialize. whether or not that includes a dog park.. maybe depends on the dog's temperament? i hear Klee Kai have bad recall, so perhaps not. i don't have much experience with dog parks. 


**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**
open to all of the above, and would love to do these things myself at home if possible. if not, i have a great relationship with the groomer my parents use and would go there. 


Personal Preferences

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**
small and light. i don't have a great reference... Mini American Eskimo might be a good comparison here too. around the average size of those, but smaller is ok as well. too small would be chihuahua sized. 


**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**
can handle a lot of shedding. barking is tolerable in short spurts, but i prefer to minimize reactive barking (coming home, leaving, someone knocks or passes by, etc). i love dogs who will chat with you, however, and enjoy dogs who bark a bit during play. can't do slobber. 


**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**
not at all, prefer to keep my dog leashed when out. i can't think of any instance where i may prefer otherwise. 


Dog Personality and Behavior

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**
both; a dog who will hang out with me on the bed or couch watching a movie, but who will also do their own thing (or just lay around nearby) when i am working. 


**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?**
both, leaning more independent for sure; but, still trainable! 


**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**
a couple barks to alert me is ok, but i don't want my dog to go ballistic until i open the door. dream scenario is, the dog keeps their distance from the door until my guest is inside and greets them. doable is, my dog comes with me to the door but does not bounce on or bark at my guest (or attempt to bolt) 


**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**
no. i am ok with either friendliness, tolerance or total disinterest.


**17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?**
again, can't deal with a dog who has no off button on play time, or who channels playful energy into being destructive. 


Lifestyle

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**
hardly ever, i am almost always at home and my partner works 75% from home. we go out once a week to try new restaurants, usually back in 2 or 3 hours. every other week we may have a movie date night or some other special occasion, that might look more like 4 or 5 hours. 


**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**
i maybe should have read the rest of the questions before i started answering, lol. my partner and i are pretty aligned on preferences, so controllable barking and manageable energy levels are high on his priority list too. he would add, that he really doesn't want to pick up poop. i advised him against big dog breeds for that reason. i've been encouraging that it's really not that bad once you've done it a few times, but he is really interested in breeds that can be litter trained or literally toilet trained... i don't mind picking up small dog poops, and this isn't a priority for me. 

we've had a lot of talks about what raising a puppy and caring for a dog entails, and he is feeling confident that he can take just as much ownership in care as i will. he's this way with maintaining our apartment and other responsibilities, so i feel confident too. 


**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**
i do not


**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**
no, not in the immediate future, but we do plan to have children eventually, maybe five years from now. 


**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**
we rent; 50lb weight limit and no breeds on the standard restricted breeds lists. 


**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**
we live in Central Texas, i am not aware of any such laws (but haven't looked into whether there are any as i am fairly sure the breeds we are interested in wouldn't face any restrictions) 


**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**
lol great question. anywhere between 80F - 110F in summer, anywhere between 70F - 10F in winter. 


Additional Information and Questions

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**
we are almost set on the Klee Kai, but i have seen some testimonies from owners regarding destructive behavior, energy levels and uncontrollable barking that is making me want to get additional opinions! 


**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**
if you don't feel the Klee Kai is right for us, do you have any recs for breeds that would match us? i would say temperament is most important for me, and looks is most important for my partner. he likes spitz-like breeds with smart, sharp appearances and pretty coats. (hound faces are a deal breaker, unfortunately ü•≤) i like many types of dogs appearance wise (i just love bright, happy, even round faces), but want a smart, trainable, funny, playful dog who can also be laidback and relaxed when we're winding down for the day.

I wonder. As he got older, I decided to avoid accidents in the house by taking them out on a fixed schedule.

309,dogs,"Hello! My dog is a two year old cocker spaniel, and boy oh boy did i mess up. 

i‚Äôll own up to it: i was stupid. i was 18 &amp; thought i knew everything about how to raise a puppy, so i didn‚Äôt think i needed to REALLY research. my first &amp; biggest mistake. 

 i took him to obedience classes as a puppy, but after that, i stopped keeping up with the training. and then covid happened, and i didn‚Äôt socialize him near as well as i should‚Äôve because living in the middle of a city, i thought long walks and dog parks were a bad idea. rather than doing research on how to socialize a dog in a pandemic, i just took him on two thirty minute walks a day and then he stayed in the house with me the rest of the day (besides bathroom breaks.) &amp; as we know, that lasted a year. the entire first year of his life, the time i should‚Äôve been doing everything i could to train &amp; socialize him. now he‚Äôs almost three. he has separation anxiety. he barks when i leave &amp; he‚Äôs territorial so he barks when he hears anything outside. and i didn‚Äôt change for the first six months after. it‚Äôs probably the thing i‚Äôm most ashamed of, as grayson is my entire world.

I‚Äôve changed my behavior in the past year. I‚Äôve read books, watched Caesar Milan‚Äôs shows, and gotten him back into obedience training &amp; keeping up with it at home. I‚Äôve been taking him to doggy day care as often as i can in the past year, and taking him on longer walks more times throughout the day, and i take him to the dog park for a few hours once a week, but he‚Äôs still very shy around new people to the point he‚Äôll bark at them for five minutes when someone he doesn‚Äôt know comes in the house whether i‚Äôm there or not (he doesn‚Äôt bite, he‚Äôs just very afraid) &amp; barks at outside noises. and he‚Äôs extremely anxious. he also anxious pees, and while i know that‚Äôs common among cocker spaniels, i‚Äôve been told that that can stop once the dog is more confident.

i know this is completely my fault. i should not have gotten a dog without doing research. but now i AM trying my best to be better. and he is doing a lot better! but the anxiety &amp; barking is still there. i don‚Äôt know what to do. i move in with new roommates in a few weeks &amp; im worried about how he‚Äôll handle living in a new environment + me being gone four hours a day with school. i don‚Äôt want him barking everytime my roommates come home, but more than that, im really worried about his anxiety with this move &amp; that is could affect his health. i need to hire a dog walker so someone can take him on walks while i‚Äôm in classes for four hours, but i can‚Äôt because it takes him so long to trust new people. i want to be a better dog owner &amp; make up for my mistakes, but i‚Äôm at a loss. also, i‚Äôve heard that giving a dog a job helps a lot, but being in a city, i can‚Äôt think of any job that would work for him, no matter how much research i put into it. does anyone have any advice?",t2_cxx9l5cv,0,need help with separation anxiety after i totally messed it up when he was a puppy,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zxpfre,True,BedroomDeep1627,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxpfre/need_help_with_separation_anxiety_after_i_totally/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxpfre/need_help_with_separation_anxiety_after_i_totally/,2476155,1672271955,0,,False,1672271972,1672271972,2022-12-28 23:59:15,,,,,,,

She developed a fear of loud noises and in the past 2 years if we are out and a thunderstorm happens or there are fireworks going off and she is terrified and will try to escape her kennel. Currently we have a wire crate and I‚Äôm not able to replace it immediately with a different kind. This last time she succeeded to get out but snapped wires and bent metal and honestly I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt hurt herself worse than her nose. (She‚Äôs fine) I‚Äôm usually vigilant when we leave and try to stay home with her during storms or firework seasons so she is with us in the house. She‚Äôs fine as long as she‚Äôs with us. Sometimes I can‚Äôt predict when it will happen and the firework season varies every year in my neighborhood apparently. I can‚Äôt control that but I can make sure my dog is safe. She respects boundaries and her kennel has two doors. The damaged door is safely secured and won‚Äôt be used. I need something that to her seems she‚Äôs fully secure and I don‚Äôt think she will force her way out. She only does it in panic.

315,dogs,"My 11 year old Shih Tzu was abruptly diagnosed with congestive heart failure last Friday. He spent the holiday weekend in the pet hospital in an oxygen tank. I am distraught, especially after learning that his life expectancy may only be 1 year. I was told some dogs enter heart failure again in months or even weeks. I cannot imagine my house without my buddy. Although he's a lazy boy, his presence alone brings me so much joy. This is my first and only dog, and I really cannot imagine life without him. I have been filled with so my stress this last week, worried about his condition and how much time I may have with him. After coming home from the hospital, he has not been himself. His energy has been low and he does not have an appetite. I can't bare to look at old photos/videos of him as I'm reminded by how things used to be. I am so distraught, and I don't know how I will cope with the grief his passing will bring. He loves me and my family unconditionally, and I love him so so much. My heart aches so much. Growing up, I was never a dog-person, but this little guy has changed me. I've never loved so hard and had so much joy. What matters the most to me now is having him live out the rest of his life comfortably. I plan on taking him on many picnics as he loves being outdoors. I really hope my buddy responds well to the medication, lives comfortably, and is able to be with me for longer than expected. 

I've seen some advice on here that getting another dog can help. However, this is a heartbreak I'd only like to go through once and can't bring myself to have another dog. My buddy means the world to me, and after his passing, I really hope that we can see each other again one day.

317,dogs,"I have a 7 year old GSD and a 1.5 year old Malamute mix. The GSD has about 20lbs on the Malamute but the malamute is constantly bullying the gsd through her superior intellect. It started when she was a little puppy and her big brother would steal all her chews. I'd give them both a chew toy and generally he would walk over and take hers when I wasn't in the room.  So she started to find the tiniest piece of cardboard she could find and act like she was having a blast with it so he would take it from her and leave the chews unattended. Then she grabbed both and put them in a spot only she fit. 

As she got older she learned any time she wants to get the older dog in trouble all she has to do is flop on the ground and shriek and I'd instinctively yell at him. So it became... oh he's chewing on a toy she wants... *flop and cry*. This resulted in quite a few interesting conversations with neighbors that think I'm torturing a puppy.  I've gotten wise to it but she still tries it regularly. It just doesn't have as much effect when she's a full grown dog shrieking like a puppy.

Most recently her tactic has been the phantom bark. If she comes in from outside and she sees he's comfortably sitting on the couch next to me in the spot she wants, she'll turn around and go to the farthest corner of the house or backyard and start barking at nothing. Then as soon as she hears him running over to investigate she sprints back over to the couch and steals his spot. Doesn't always work out for her though. He's still bigger than her. Sometimes he just sits on her.

We left our pup with my in laws over the last week while we had to travel for Christmas. He had a blast with them and they took very good care of him but we did notice a change in his coat shedding/texture upon bringing him home today. Usually his coat (about 1 inch long) is very smooth, has a conditioned feel to it. He's had minimal to no shedding all winter, presumably to keep his thicker winter coat.

Today when we brought him home his coat is feeling rougher and brittle, he had some dander and a major increase in shedding. Areas where he has little cowlicks feel spikier, if that makes sense. This is a major change in his coat texture. It's never felt like this before.

What could cause his coat to change so quickly? Stress from us leaving? It was bitter cold this week and he was taking walks close to the beach (but not right on the water) so could it be increased dryness?

323,dogs,"My family bought a 5 month old Golden Retriever puppy yesterday. We had heard that the breeder had a pretty good reputation, they've been breeding pure bred retrievers for over 15 years and many of there dogs have show titles. We were told that the litter was much larger than they were expecting, which is why there were still puppies left that were so old. We met the litter, and chose a puppy that seemed outgoing and confident. We met the Mom, she seemed a bit shy but warmed up to us after a minute. That should have been a red flag.

The car ride home was tough. The puppy hid under the seat for the 45 minute drive. When we got home, everyone left the car except for me, I was going to wait until he came out by himself instead of dragging him out. I waited almost an hour, softly talking to him and he hid and panted the entire time with little signs of calming down. Eventually, his breathing seemed a bit wet, so I decided to just drag him out and carry him inside. He immediately went into shut down mode, hiding in the corner not moving for the next 2 hours, neither food or treats seemed to have any effect. Eventually, he slowly started to explore. By the end of the night he was cautiously walking around the kitchen (the room we had gated off as the puppy room) but we was still refusing to go outside. Every time we ever open the door, we runs and hides. We live about a block away from a major road, and it was dark and pouring rain, so we thought that might be the problem. We eventually carried him outside and waited for about 20 minutes but we was clearly scared and didn't pee so we eventually gave up. He slept in a penned off area with blankets in the corner, I slept on the couch within his sight and smell. He did okay overnight, only whining for about 3 minutes, and did have an accdident which we expected.

In the morning, nothing much changed. He is still terrified to go outside, even little bits of chicken or bacon can't tempt him. He is still very cautious, he doesn't seem excited to see people, just nervous. We called a trainer with the aim of making an appointment, and after hearing all about this she recommended we send him back. She said that the breeder we got him from used to have a good reputation, but these days breeds too many dogs and doesn't do enough socialization. In her words, she would be happy to work with us, and he would likely improve a lot over specific fears, but after 5 months he is likely to always be a nervous and fearful dog.

328,dogs,"My 13 year old rescue, some kind of Lhasa Apso/Tibetan Terrier mix, has just been diagnosed with a liver tumor. We still do not have pathology, and the only way to test it is to have it fully removed (with margins) because of the nature of this tumor.

It is the kind of tumor that is full of pockets of fluid, and at risk of rupturing and bleeding out at any moment, which will kill him if not removed. We only found out about this because he was running around, having the time of his life at the dog park last Monday, and ended up in the dog ER on Tuesday with a bad limp (we thought he went too hard at the park LOL). Somehow we went in for a limp, and left with the news of a liver tumor, that was filling his belly with blood and fluid. We now know today, after a follow up with his usual vet, that he is lucky to be alive after what turned out to be a less severe rupture likely because of his time at the park. I consider this his saving grace. He is completely asymptomatic otherwise.

The vet gave us the ""he's 13, so is he realistically going to live that much longer, to make it worth operating on him?"" and I am like, heck yeah, I'd rather he not bleed to death internally if thats whats going to get him. If he just has this one tumor (so far ultrasound and x-ray show no sign of spread) and livers are quite remarkable organs that can regenerate with up to 80% removed without serious issues, I would hope that he can live to his full potential once it is removed!!!!

He has so much life left in him, and the vet was remarking today that everyone in the office could not believe his age. He said he is puppy like, and besides the liver issues, he is in incredible shape. This makes me think that if caught early and the tumor is removed, he could live a longer life. He is so loved by everyone who knows him, even the vet tech was on the verge of tears.

I just want to hear stories of hope, and know that there are dogs out there who beat the odds, or have similar stories that ended positively.

331,dogs,"Hi all, thank you in advance for taking the time to read!

My SO and I moved recently to Queens, and we were talking about the possibility of adopting/rescuing a dog in a year or so. We live in a two-room apartment and both work from home.   
‚Äî 

**Introduction**

1.  *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?*   
This will technically be my first dog, but my SO has grown up with two lovely Goldendoodles. He has experience with training, and I am more than willing to share responsibility with training/owning. I have also dog-sat for many neighbors and people throughout the past few years for periods as long as a week. 
2. *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*  
There is no strong preference, but I would prefer to rescue since there are a decent amount of shelters nearby and would love to give a rescue a home. I do understand, however, that some rescue dogs come with trauma or potential behavior issues; I am not experienced with such dogs and understand it will require a lot of learning on my end to rescue one.
3. *Describe your ideal dog.*  
Preferably a friendly, calm, playful and affectionate dog that loves to cuddle or lounge on the couch during parts of the day/night. Independent and not super vocal since we have neighbors. My SO prefers medium to larger dogs like Goldendoodles, but we understand that a two-room (not super cramped, though) apartment may not be the best for a bigger dog. 
4. *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*   
Honestly, no commitment to any specific breed but they must have hair instead of fur (due to SO allergy - he's mildly allergic to fur so we would prefer to minimize that). Perhaps a mix breed. I really love the patience and friendliness of Goldendoodles; like I mentioned in the last question, we're interested in a versatile temperament of affection, calm, and playful that enjoys lounging with us on the couch. My SO, however, doesn't want a super tiny dog. He adamantly prefers larger dogs but is willing to get a medium-sized dog.  
5. *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*  
All of the basics (come when called, sit, lay down, stay, drop it, etc.) as well as socializing with other dogs.
6. *Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport or use your dog for a form of work?*  
No, just looking for a lovely companion :) 

**Care Commitments**

1. *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  
Regarding training, I would be able to do so daily (or at the least every other day) because I work from home. An hour or two of walking/playtime per day would be great, and I would love to consistently interact with them throughout the day since we're both working remotely.
2. *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*  
As mentioned above, I would be able to do a 45-minute to an hour long walk daily around the neighborhood. A small park is near us where we can walk through easily, but there are dog parks that are a 30-minute walk away, or a 15 minute drive, and we could occasionally go every weekend or so. But we mainly plan just for the walks being the most frequent form of exercise.
3. *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it professionally?*   
Because we do not have grooming experience (nor do we want to mess anything up lol), we are budgeting to take the dog to a professional groomer every month or two (depending on the breed and once it's decided we will follow the recommended time frame).

**Personal Preferences**

1. *What size dog are you looking for?*  
Medium - not too small, but not too big to be miserable in a smaller apartment. 
2. *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*  
Looking to avoid heavy shedding, loud frequent barking (we have close neighbors), and high slobber breeds.
3. *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*  
Not as important since we live in an urban area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

1. *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*  
A combination - can occupy themselves with toys or etc., but loves affection and lots of snuggles when we're relaxing. 
2. *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that's more eager-to-please?*  
Eager-to-please!
3. *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? Greeting strangers or visitors?*  
I would prefer our dog to be friendly and curious when greeting strangers and visitors. They can be cautious at knocks or if anyone enters the property, but no excessive or obsessive barking. Overall calm and nice.
4. *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*  
No, since we plan to socialize them with other dogs.
5. *Are there any other behaviors you can't deal with or want to avoid?*  
Any extensive special diets, human/dog/animal aggression, overly slobbery.

**Lifestyle**

1. *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*  
As said, we work remotely so we will spend the majority of our time with them. The most amount of time wouldn't be more than 6 hours if we happen to go out on a weekend night, go out for dinner, or any other situation. We also have family/friends living near that can easily (and willingly hang out) if longer or we run late.
2. *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*  
My SO and I will share even responsibility for the dog. He prefers a larger/medium dog with the same qualities I've detailed throughout the post. Because of neighbors, again - minimal barking. 
3. *Do you have other pets or planning to? What breed or type of animal are they?*  
We are not planning to have another pet anytime soon as we want to focus on the one. Occasionally, we will pet-sit his family Goldendoodle who is a very friendly and calm senior dog. And (way less often) his brother has a small, curious and social Maltese. I can only think of them interacting if we bring the dog with us for holidays when visiting family. 
4. *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*  
Not daily. Occasionally (a few times of year), I visit my nephews who are all under the age of eight. 
5. *Do you rent or plan to in the future? Are there breed or weight restrictions on your current lease?*  
We currently rent, but there are no current restrictions. 
6. *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*  
NYC/Queens, no.
7. *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*  
Summer: 78-90 degrees   
Winter: 15-40 degrees

**Additional Information &amp; Questions**

* This will be my first dog and my SO's third.
* Are their certain breeds that sound like a good fit for our situation?

Thank you, and I would love any feedback or advice!",t2_8ih8108n,0,"[Breeds] Young Couple in Queens, NY","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üìùRecommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üìùRecommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,zxm3x5,True,ms_sn00ks,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxm3x5/breeds_young_couple_in_queens_ny/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxm3x5/breeds_young_couple_in_queens_ny/,2476119,1672264175,0,,False,1672264190,1672264190,2022-12-28 21:49:35,,,,,,,
332,dogs,"This past August, my wife and I suffered the very sudden and unexpected loss of our beloved greyhound due to an incident at our regular veterinarian here in Madison, WI. We‚Äôre trying to determine what our legal options may be.

The short version is that our greyhound died after escaping from a vet technician when being let outside to potty after a routine dental procedure. Rue ‚Äî a 9-year-old greyhound in great health ‚Äî¬†collapsed just before staff were able to get her back to the clinic, and couldn‚Äôt be revived. The clinic owner fully admitted fault and that the tech didn‚Äôt follow the clinic‚Äôs procedure when taking Rue outside, **which we have an audio recording of.**

The months since Rue‚Äôs passing have been extremely difficult, as Rue was a major part of our daily life. We‚Äôre trying to find out what we could potentially stand to gain from taking legal action against the clinic and determine if it‚Äôs worth pursuing. If you think we indeed stand to gain something from taking action, please let me know.

‚Äî

The long version of the situation is explained below. Besides the dates and info about Rue, the following details are according to the clinic owner and veterinarians there:

On August 17, our 9-year-old greyhound, Rue ‚Äî who we had for 5 years ‚Äî had a routine dental cleaning at our regular vet clinic. It involved extracting a couple of teeth. After waking from her anesthesia, a vet tech took Rue outside to potty, which the vet owner explained is their standard procedure. 

According to the vet owner, While outside, the vet tech dropped Rue‚Äôs leash, and with her ‚Äòstranger-danger‚Äô temperament, Rue fled. That vet has no outdoor fencing, so Rue quickly got far. The clinic called and informed me that Rue had escaped and asked for me to come to help corral her. My wife and I left the house a few minutes later, and while en route to the clinic, we received another call from the clinic saying that they got Rue back and that we should arrive as soon as possible. 

Upon arriving a few minutes later, we were directed to what we learned to be the vet's grieving room, where the owner informed us that Rue had passed away just before we arrived. He explained that after multiple vet techs pursued Rue, a good samaritan in the neighborhood was able to get a hold of her, and one of the techs got her into a car, and Rue collapsed shortly after. Resuscitation efforts were performed when they got her back to the clinic, but to no avail.

The owner explained the timeline of events, repeatedly apologized and admitted fault. He said the vet would cover the cost of Rue‚Äôs procedure that day, the cost to have her cremated, and to have a paw print and lock of fur kept for us, which they did. He also said the clinic would make a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô donation to the Greyhound Pets of America-Wisconsin‚Äôs Blue Fund, which we later found out to be $1000.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that explained, we're trying to figure out if legal action is worth pursuing, and any advice if so. We audio recording gives us clear proof of the vet admitting fault, but we're still not sure what could potentially be gained.",t2_4ddwc7yy,0,Vet Malpractice Legal Options,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zxlt84,True,LetsAllCalmDown_,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxlt84/vet_malpractice_legal_options/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxlt84/vet_malpractice_legal_options/,2476118,1672263467,0,,False,1672263482,1672263483,2022-12-28 21:37:47,,,,,,,

337,dogs,"Hi! I‚Äôm looking into options for training a psychiatric service animal. My mom has four dogs who I have grown up around, and my allergies have been pretty severe despite consistent medication and allergy injections.

Because of that, I‚Äôm looking into low-shed breeds (and I am aware that all dogs shed and that none are truly hypoallergenic.) I‚Äôve narrowed it down to either a standard poodle or a giant shnauzer based on my needs. Ideally, I would like to train from a puppy/young dog because it‚Äôs what I have experience with.

The problem is that I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here. I‚Äôve been looking into rescues, but I‚Äôve read conflicting opinions on whether I need to know my dog‚Äôs lineage or not. I live in Texas, and have fostered for a local rescue, so i‚Äôm very wary of breeders. 

Id really appreciate any advice on whether I should go the rescue route or if anyone knows any reputable schnauzer/poodle breeders in the Dallas/East TX area.

338,dogs,"My family and I own a 3 year old golden retriever. His name is Loki. We got him during 2020 covi season, so he isn't very good at meeting other dogs and ignoring them on the trail; since he wasn't used to seeing other dogs during the isolation. 

He grew up with another dog in the house, so he knows how to play well, and he is good with a dog once he has already met them. He has a few dog friends from other families that come over and play with him, and he is perfectly well-behaved with those dogs.

I just want to get him to be less skiddish upon first introduction and to be less defensive when we pass other dogs on the trail. Sometimes, when we pass dogs too closely, he will lunge or bark at a fence. 

I am going to try new strategies, like giving treats to him while dogs pass us on the road, using a loose leash, keeping myself relaxed, etc. But any other tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have a 1 year old Canaan and he likes to do a nightout once or twice a week. We live in a village so there's not proper wall to keep him inside the premise. He's quite vigilant at night and prefers to sleep outside to guard the house. He's a big and strong dog by the way and is known for it around. I sleep late so I always give him treat around 11-1 am and he's always happy to see me. Some nights he'd scratch my door but some nights he's just not there. He just won't sleep in the house and prefers to stay out. Even though he's friendly towards people and other dog of the premise, he's quite aggressive towards stray dogs.

I've tried to keep him inside the room but he gets uncomfortable and starts barking. He just won't let me sleep.

I don't want to get him neutered unless he becomes agressive towards human because as of now, he's not weak and can take care of himself very well.

For the swings, we can‚Äôt even sit on it or he‚Äôll start whining. If we start to swing he‚Äôll jump up on us and prevent us from swinging.

357,dogs,"Hey there again.

You guys might remember me as the girl making her first post about her husky with terminal cancer and her neighbors.

I came to WA to let him play in the snow for the last time, as well as get some help from my boyfriend's family. We did a roadtrip up (always our favorite activity) and he spent so much time seeing friends, family, and getting to do fun things. 

In less than two weeks, he had his biggest decline yet. He was only 6 but everyone thought he was 11-12. Cancer is so horrible. On my birthday, he stayed out in the snow for hours with me calling and begging him to come back. After he came in, I knew he was ready to go. I did the worst thing I've ever done, and brought him into the vet. 

He looked so at peace when he died. I could tell he wasn't in pain anymore. He died with cheese whiz on his paws and a smile on his face. 

I haven't been able to do anything but cry and hide from everyone since. He was my ESA and I have struggled my whole life with severe depression, chronic pain/illness, and PTSD. He brought me out of my darkness and gave me so much light. I miss him more than I can even begin to write.  Doing things like eating, taking care of myself, or doing work seem like insurmountable obstacles. I am seeing my therapist and psychiatrist weekly to help cope.

358,dogs,"Moose is our dog we adopted about 2 months ago. Breed is unknown but we think he has Golden and Rott in him (about 40 lbs) and the age the shelter told us is 5 but we think he might actually be 2. 

We need some insight into keeping Moose entertained. We‚Äôve looked into different enrichment videos and posts, as well as tries different things, but Moose has two specific ideas of fun. 

1. He loves to tear things apart. The only toys that really pique his interest are ones he can destroy. But everything else bores him within minutes. When he has a plush, he will spend the next 20 minutes absolutely destroying it And loving every minute of it. We were at a family members house and moose got into a rawhide toy, which I know is not great for dogs, and he doesn‚Äôt have that at home, but he loved it because he could destroy it. I think he likes feeling accomplished when he destroys thing. We have Kong toys and benebones and get the aggressive chewer box from chewy, but most things that involve food, he really doesn‚Äôt care too much about. He doesn‚Äôt like his puzzle feeder and if we feed him in the puzzle or feed her, he just won‚Äôt really eat as much as he needs to.

2. Moose loves being outside. However, he also really likes digging holes. We have a fenced in yard and he does a lot of running and that helps get his energy out. But we cannot be outside with him every single time he goes out. When he is unsupervised, he digs holes. I am currently working on filling those holes with his own poop and Cayenne pepper so that he does not do it. I am working on trying to correct that behavior as well. But I‚Äôve heard that, what the issue is is that he is not being entertained enough outside. We try to teach him fetch and he is not great with dropping the ball but he‚Äôll run after it.

Note: we take him on walks when we can, but lately the weather has been so cold it‚Äôs not safe for him. We take him in the car and to the store when we can so he gets out of the house. We pay so much attention to him when we are home. He sleeps with us at night. The only time he ever goes in his crate is when we were at work because we know that he will destroy things. We are home most of the time because we are homebodies.

Are there any suggestions that you guys have for a ways we can keep him entertained in the backyard that aren‚Äôt too crazy expensive. Additionally, do you have any suggestions for toys for dogs like to tear apart things and feel accomplished?

364,dogs,"Hi. Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered. 

I have a two year old dog and she is amazingly behaved. The last time she had an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù in the house she was 4 months old. She is also in perfect health. 

My issue is that at night I am waking up 1-2 times to take her out to pee. She can hold it when we are not home but when she knows we are it seems that this changes. She does not drink excessively before bed and I take her out for the last time at 11:30 pm. She gets an hour walk before bed (and two other 45 minute walks throughout the day). This generally tires her out as shown by her falling asleep afterwards (clearly not from boredom). I do snore at night and move around when asleep. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why she may be waking me up so often at night and how I may be able to fix this? Would a dog bed work and if so, how do you recommend I transitioning her from my bed to the dog bed so that she can get a better nights sleep (maybe even eventually having her sleep in another room)?

368,dogs,"Dog refusing to eat‚Äî tried battle of wills to the point where he‚Äôs losing too much weight too fast. REFUSES to give in.

14 year old beagle (rescued 2 years ago) has been on hills science K/D (early stage renal failure) for two years. A few months ago he decided he did not like his food anymore. He‚Äôd done this before so every few months I‚Äôd just change the flavor/brand and it was fine. This time, nothing was helping‚Äî I‚Äôd switch to a different flavor/brand/type/texture/temp and nothing worked. I‚Äôd literally lay out a platter of options and nope.

It‚Äôs pure stubbornness. He wants to eat, he has an appetite. On top of him becoming absolutely ravenous with hunger and becoming a bit of trouble at home, he went from 37lbs to 33 in about a month and is noticeable skinny to where neighbors and sitters are asking me about it. The most he‚Äôd give in is maybe a quarter cup *every other day*. 

About a month ago we worked with the vet and BalanceIt to homemake his food with the prescription supplements he needs for his kidney disease. He ate very well up until about a week ago‚Äî we are now back to him not wanting to eat it.

The vet is instructing me not to try different food or recipe because when we do that is ‚Äúgiving in‚Äù and encouraging his pickiness.

Yes he is aged but one would never guess it. The diet has kept his kidney disease well under control to where it is not affecting his overall health so it‚Äôs not yet a matter of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs old/sick give him whatever he wants‚Äù because as we‚Äôve experimented in the past, when he starts getting too much regular food or even just treats his levels skyrocket which *does* accelerate the renal failure significantly.

369,dogs,"Hi, I got back from vacation and noticed my dog was breathing funny/harder than normal so I took her to the vet same day. The vet agreed and did an xray, said she did notice some fluid in her lungs and it was mild, she wasn't concerned about her oxygen levels or anything like that, really didn't have any major concerns at all. She wanted to send it off to a radiologist for a second opinion and then emailed this in the morning:

The radiologist agrees that there is a mild lung pattern present consistent with either a pneumonia or an inflammatory/infectious bronchitis. The treatment for these are different, but the radiologist recommends continuing with antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and assessing the response. We can recheck her chest x-rays in 7 days to see if the pattern is clearing and if her symptoms are improving. For now, stay the course with the medications prescribed.

As far as the remainder of the x-ray report, there is no evidence of masses or tumors anywhere and her organs all appear normal. Her heart is normal size with no concerns.
___
That said, my dog's behavior hasn't changed other than a bit more sleepy than usual, and she is still eating and drinking normally. After 1 dose of the medications she started breathing slightly better already but after Googling pneumonia in dogs, everything looks fucking terrifying.

Is there any advice you all are willing to share? Or does anyone have any positive words or stories for encouragement. I'm so scared now that I googled but I don't want to project it because I think it stems from my aunt passing of pneumonia as well, and I don't know how long my girl has had it because we were out of town for 2 weeks. We also don't know how old she is but we think around 9/10. She's a yorkie-mix.

370,dogs,"14 year old beagle (rescued 2 years ago) has been on hills science K/D (early stage renal failure) for two years. A few months ago he decided he did not like his food anymore. He‚Äôd done this before so every few months I‚Äôd just change the flavor/brand and it was fine. This time, nothing was helping‚Äî I‚Äôd switch to a different flavor/brand/type/texture/temp and nothing worked. I‚Äôd literally lay out a platter of options and nope.

It‚Äôs pure stubbornness. He wants to eat, he has an appetite. On top of him becoming absolutely ravenous with hunger and becoming a bit of trouble at home, he went from 37lbs to 33 in about a month and is noticeable skinny to where neighbors and sitters are asking me about it. The most he‚Äôd give in is maybe a quarter cup *every other day*. 

About a month ago we worked with the vet and BalanceIt to homemake his food with the prescription supplements he needs for his kidney disease. He ate very well up until about a week ago‚Äî we are now back to him not wanting to eat it.

The vet is instructing me not to try different food or recipe because when we do that is ‚Äúgiving in‚Äù and encouraging his pickiness.

Yes he is aged but one would never guess it. The diet has kept his kidney disease well under control to where it is not affecting his overall health so it‚Äôs not yet a matter of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs old/sick give him whatever he wants‚Äù because as we‚Äôve experimented in the past, when he starts getting too much regular food or even just treats his levels skyrocket which *does* accelerate the renal failure significantly.

He is literally starving himself into bones but if I give him other food or even something like broth it makes his actual health worse and hurls him towards death that way.

375,dogs,"Not sure where to post this but hopefully some advice helps. 

I have a 4 y.o chihuahua terrier mix and 2.5 y.o chihuahua terrier mix. Both females are spayed. Had the 2.5 y.o as a pup, 4 y.o has been fine with her and the 2.5 y.o has been fine with her. The 4 y.o is a bit more of a grump, usually the one that is more of a bully and will usually just chill at the corner.  2.5 y.o is more of a ""happier""dog, nicer and more submissive. They got along fine, they would play together at times and sleep in the same bed with me at the same time. 


Recently though they seem to not like eachother much. It seems to be more on the 2.5 y.o which is more surprising because usually it would be the 4 y.o that's a ""meanie"" (one that I'd assume would start the fights) and 2.5 y.o is more submissive. They have fought 2 times already (luckily no injuries in both) the first fight was when one accidentally stepped on the other on my bed and they started to fight. Second fight they were just chilling on my bed ready to sleep and I pick up the 2.5 y.o to get my blanket and somehow being picked up triggered her to fight the 4 y.o on my bed. Today I wake up the morning with my 2.5 y.o with me in bed then my 4 y.o enters the room to sleep in my bedand I noticed the younger one perk up her ears and tense up (I could tell this wasn't going to end right) so I picked her up and she started to growl. At this point I took her outside (she needed to potty anyway) and let my 4 y.o be in my room in the meantime.


Other than that, they will be fine, they will tussle around and play or just co exist together. But lately they have seem to tolerate themselves a little less, (or at least in my room they haven't, other area in the house like sleeping together on couch they will be fine)  and I'm concerned because they are both spayed and have never had a problem since then and have gotten along before.

I have 2 dogs, which I love a ton and today was looking like any other day. After our routine walk, I let one of my dog roam in front of the house while I took one of the more energetic one to walk a bit more. 

I should've paid more attention. I know my dog was near the fence. When I tried to close the main gate, his tail was on the gate rail. 

He yelped and ran inside, which almost gave me a heart attack and blood was everywhere he went. I didn't really know what happened at this time so I assumed the worst. My anxiety was at the worst level for years.

I brought him to the vet immediately and the vet said it wasn't too bad, after a syringe and spray wound he was sent home. 

But I still can't get over it. He probably forget about it already, but It's my fault. If I just paid more attention or use less force, he would've not been in pain.

We have a 9mo old mini Aussie doodle, who‚Äôs a real wildman. 4 days ago, he chewed up and swallowed one of those small plastic clamps that cinch the elastic at the bottom of a jacket. It was only about 1/2x1/4 inch. We know he swallowed it because he did it when we were trying to get it out of his mouth. Little shit.

3 days passed, and no plastic in his poop nor any sign of discomfort (normal energy, appetite, etc.), so we didn‚Äôt think much of it. 

However, this morning (almost 4 days later), he threw it up! Vomit was clear with no signs of blood. I have no idea how the mechanics of this would work, other than it somehow getting stuck in his stomach prior to moving in to the intestinal tract. One worrisome thing is that the plastic was quite sharp from him chewing on it.

386,dogs,"We have a 9.5 month old female German shepherd/malinois that we got at 10 weeks old. She is the most destructive dog I've ever encountered and I am at my wits end... please help!!

I want to start off by saying that I have experience with high energy/high drive dogs as I also have a 5.5 year old Vizsla that I raised from 10 weeks as well. As you can imagine, my V needs tons of mental stimulation, affection, and lots and lots of exercise.

My V has never ever destroyed anything in my house even as a puppy. He was never crated and has always had free run of the whole house. I could even leave a plate of food out on the coffee table all day while I'm at work and he'll never touch it.

Our female dog, the GSD/malinois is barricaded in the kitchen by a series of baby gates when we aren't home. She is now able to jump up on the counters and reach into the mudroom and grab things when we are gone. She is an INSANE chewer. She has chewed baseboards, the drawers of our island, and literally anything she can reach and get into her mouth. On average, she finds and destroys 3-5 things a day. In the last 24 hours, she has chewed a brand new $150 pair of running shoes and a $200 bike helmet which she was able to get by pushing the baby gate and standing on her back legs. She knocked the helmet off a top shelf on a hall tree that she was able to shake with her front paws. You might be wondering why we don't just move everything out of reach. Well,  we do! The other day I came home and she had wedged her head under a baby gate, opened up our pantry and pulled out a 10kg bag of rice that was chewed open and alllll over the floor. Another day she had chewed her own dog bed. Another day, the frame on the garden door in the kitchen. 

She gets an hour off leash trail walk in the morning, my partner then plays fetch and does training/obedience exercises with her for about 30 minutes before we leave for work. Someone comes home at lunch to let both dogs out and plays with them some more and do training/puzzle games. Then we leave her with bones, toys, antlers, puzzle toys... you name it for the afternoon. When we get home from work, the dogs go for a 1-2+ hour off leash hike in pretty rugged terrain EVERYDAY rain or shine. Then they come home and it's more puzzles and training or scent games until they finally crash at about 8pm. Which is when we can finally start making our dinner.  The dogs dictate our entire lives and our schedule. There is no way that we could physically get these dogs more stimulation or exercise if we tried without taking them to an all day doggy daycare which, with a baby on the way, is not really in our budget right now but it's not off the table. 

I'm currently 8 months pregnant and I cannot deal with the destructiveness of this dog. She has cost us thousands in damage and she's not even a year old. I want to start crating her while we're out of the house but my partner is 110% opposed to crating. He is not even open to the discussion. He thinks she'll grow out of it with age and that it's just a phase and it's not a big deal. From what I've seen, it's just getting worse and worse and now she isn't teething, she has all her adult teeth. This level of chewing is not acceptable to me at all.

I've had dogs my whole life and never seen anything like this before. I don't believe it's separation anxiety because I've set up a recorder and she doesn't howl, bark, or cry when we leave. She usually is asleep when we leave for work and then as soon as she wakes up or is bored a couple hours later, she starts chewing and looking for trouble when no one is around.

The craziest part of this entire situation is that my partner's parents have a sister from the exact same litter. Their dog (the sister of ours) is left alone in his parents' house all day for 9+ hour stretches with free run and their house is filled with baby toys and lots of junk left out. She doesn't touch a single thing and never has. They let her outside to go pee in the morning and after work... the dog is RARELY walked and when she is, it's a few minutes on leash just to get her to poo. I'm talking maybe once a month do they ever take her on leash off of their property. She is tied out on their deck but she has never once been walked off leash, taken on a walk longer than 20 minutes on leash, and has never hiked, played a scent game, can't fetch, knows no commands, etc. They are VERY old school and don't interact much with the dog so no mental stimulation at all. Whenever we visit, their dog is just sleeping beside their sliding door and is always pretty mellow.


Are we overdoing it and causing our dog to be bored? We are investing on average 6-7hours DAILY of our own time and energy into this dog and thousands of dollars on chews and fixing damage caused by this dog. It's so exasperating to see this chewing behaviour just ramping up instead of gettint it more under control. With a baby on the way, our budget is getting too tight and we can't afford to replace some of these things she's destroyed and it's heartbreaking.

Also worth noting - my partner and I both attended puppy classes and obedience classes with her this summer. She was FAR and above the worst behaved dog in all the classes. The trainer even said ""hmm seems like a very anxious dog"". She would bark and whine and howl for the entire class and not respond to us at all even with high value treats.

She is not at all food motivated. But neither is my v so I was not really surprised by that. However my V is very praise-motivated and might be one of the most well trained, best tempered, and obedient dogs you'll ever meet.

This new dog has completely thrown me for a loop. I cannot take it anymore. In the eyes of my partner, she is perfect and can do no wrong but I'm on the verge of a breakdown. Please help!!! All insight is appreciated. 

Will she grow out of this? What can we do in the meantime? Do I have a case for crate training? Should we budget for doggy daycare??

397,dogs,"When I got my puppy at 8 weeks she was the runt of her litter and very small for her breed (toy Manchester terrier) and the breeder said their vet cleared her to go home but had a sprained front leg that she was holding up. The breeders vet said it would heal up and would be fine (documented on records). Three days after I brought her home I took her to my vet and they noted her holding up her leg and that she had what looked like a bump on her back. Due to her size (less than 2 lbs!) we decided that we could do x-rays to find out what was going on when she was a bit bigger. My vet had an offer with Trupanion to sign up at the first vet visit and the initial waiting period would be waived and it was free for a month so I signed up. I looked into other pet insurance since it seemed like my puppy could possibly have issues due to her size. Trupanion stated in their advertising that they cover congenital and genetic hereditary issues where other companies did not state this. All of the companies said they do not cover pre existing conditions. Trupanion specifically says they do not cover pre existing conditions that ""showed signs"" before enrollment. I still decided to stay with them because of their advertised covering congenital issues even though to insure her breed it was 100$ per month with a 250 deductible. Trupanion sends me an email stating that they will not cover anything to do with her lameness or bump on her back because it showed signs at her first appointment. I gave them a bad review after this email since she had not been formally diagnosed with anything at that point other than a sprain from the breeders vet and general lameness from my vet. Trupanion customer service called me and I asked them if they would cover other issues related to her leg in the future such as an actual break/cancer etc (lots of things can happen to her leg) and the rep said they would look at each claim and our vet can discuss with the claims specialist etc. I also specifically asked what their definition of congenital was vs pre existing condition and the rep could not answer me and said that a claims specialist would determine it at the time of a claim. By definition congenital means from birth or during the process of birthing. Any issue that would be considered to be from birth would also be considered pre existing since noone would have insured their dog before it was born. Again they could not answer my questions in any way. You would think that if you have it in your advertising then your customer service would understand the definition and be able to answer your question accurately. We find out later after doing x-rays she has a severe congenital spinal deformity and a congenital defect in her right shoulder blade (she doesn't actually have a joint). When we tried to submit a claim for her diagnostic x-rays that determined this they denied the claim saying it was pre existing. We weren't even trying to claim anything else beyond this since her condition needs a specialist and her spine probably cannot be fixed at this point. They then send a super condescending email on how to submit claims and what they don't cover while saying they hope my puppy is doing well. My vet appealed the decision and also had the same questions for them about what congenital means and basically they were also talked down to ""we know it's confusing but..."" And said it was pre existing. When I looked at other insurance other companies were cheaper and covered things like exam fees, consultation fees, taxes all of which Trupanion does not cover but I went with them because they stated they cover congenital issues and genetic issues. I could have gone with another company that also would not have covered her leg/spine issues that would have been cheaper and covered more things. For example we did have to take her to emerg when she was 4 months because she had a seizure. Trupanion covered 130$ of a 700$ bill since they do not cover the exam/emerg fee or taxes and after my deductible (250$). Another company would have covered the taxes and fees. Now I am stuck with them because they did cover her emerg visit for her seizure and a subsequent vet visit for another seizure and those would be pre existing with another company. I understand that my puppy will require alot of care and will cost alot and I'm not even arguing against insurance. I feel that trupanion advertising they cover congenital issues but not specifically stating only ones that are not visible at your first appointment is misleading. They should just remove that they cover congenital issues from their advertising and stick with saying they don't cover pre existing conditions. Since if you can't see a congenital issue at your first appointment then it wouldn't be prw existing and they would cover it. I insured my puppy as soon as I could and it did not matter in her situation.",t2_40uobh80,0,"Trupanion needs to remove that they cover ""congenital"" issues from their advertising or clearly define what congenital means for their policies","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zxabsv,True,Outside-Argument-540,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zxabsv/trupanion_needs_to_remove_that_they_cover/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zxabsv/trupanion_needs_to_remove_that_they_cover/,2475994,1672236150,0,,False,1672236161,1672236161,2022-12-28 14:02:30,,,,,,,

400,dogs,"My family has a 6-year-old dog who is very social with people and loves playing with certain dogs, but is overall dog selective and does not get along with all dogs--I'd say it's around 50/50 for dogs she likes and doesn't like. Dogs that she likes, she really, really likes and plays really well and respectfully with them. Dogs that she doesn't like she snaps at easily and gets into scuffles with. She doesn't react to these dogs that she doesn't vibe with unless they're getting up in her space but if they do (even when they're innocently trying to initiate play or just sniffing her to say hi for too long of a time) she'll give way too strong of overcorrections and then be clearly uncomfortable for the rest of the time she's around that dog.

Because of this, my family just sticks with letting her socialize only with dogs that we know she gets along with. Any on-leash greetings are strictly avoided with her and we don't do dog parks (with any of our dogs). However, I've been wondering if it would be worthwhile to try to improve her tolerance level of other dogs. There have been situations in the past where she's ended up around dogs she doesn't like despite our best efforts and although we always manage the situation as best we can to make sure all the dogs stay safe and unstressed, it would be really nice to not have to worry so much about that (we'd always supervise any dogs when they're interacting, of course, but it would be nice to be able to let her interact with more dogs and not have to constantly make her keep her distance because we don't know how she'll react) and I wish she could feel fully comfortable around more dogs instead of feeling like she has to act defensive around some of them. 

Has anyone with a dog selective dog found success in helping them be more dog tolerant? I'm pretty certain that my family would be willing to work with a trainer on this if that's something that can help, but I don't know how far training can actually go if a dog is just naturally dog selective. Can something like this be altered through things like desensitization and resocialization, or is it too innate of a temperament trait to be changed? Are there exercises we can do with her at home to help with this, or is it something that should be left totally to a professional? 

I'm just curious whether working on this is something that's a realistic goal and worth investing time and potentially money into and if it's not, that's totally okay in terms of us caring for our dog! We absolutely adore this dog, would have no issues with her dog selectively never improving, and would always just maintain our management strategies to keep her safe and psychologically comfortable.

she doesn't have any terminal illnesses, but she's nearly deaf and blind and seems so, so sad all the time. the vet doesn't think she's in any pain, but she goes through these phases where i just see the life force fleeing her eyes - i can't put it into words, but it's just the gut feeling.

TLDR: so, how do you know when is the time to euthanize? generally speaking the animal is not terminal, only shows signs of aging and a decreased level of energy, maybe some pyschological stress. is it humane to euthanize an animal like this? i'm insanely scared of taking her life away, but i feel like she's in some sort of stress 24/7. the vet has no advice",t2_os21fy7q,0,"senior dog is getting worse, yet nothing seems to be wrong","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,3,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,True,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zx9eng,True,doggomeat4,,1,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zx9eng/senior_dog_is_getting_worse_yet_nothing_seems_to/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zx9eng/senior_dog_is_getting_worse_yet_nothing_seems_to/,2475987,1672233596,0,,False,1672233607,1672233608,2022-12-28 13:19:56,,,,,,,

However, when we take her to my parents or my partner's parents or when they come over, she ends up socialising with her siblings (as we all had pups from the same litter), and she immediately loses all training and control. 

She doesn't listen to commands, and often does dangerous things like run out the front door, or things she never does, like jumping on furniture, jumping up at people and even not doing her tricks for treats.

Is this common? And are there any training methods we can use to try and modify this behaviour?

411,dogs,"Disclaimer: I made a misinformed and irresponsible decision and I‚Äôd like some advice on what to do now.

My 10 weeks old cocker spaniel came out for a walk in a dog carrying sling on Christmas Eve. He had his first vaccine at 8 weeks and is due for his second in a couple of days time. Whilst the coast was clear and no dogs were around (except my friends vaccinated dog) I walked him about 400m on a lead down a country park path which was a mixture of tarmac and grass. I thought since no other dogs were present for this that this would be a relatively safe thing to do.

Upon doing some further reading it appears that this approach was naive and stupid however. Seems like the risk of infection is much higher/almost guaranteed.

He hasn‚Äôt shown any symptoms thus far though I understand this is early days in the incubation period.

Realistically,

What is the likelihood that my little man is infected with some kind of disease? (Parvo etc.)

What can I do to mitigate any infection he may now have?

415,dogs,"My sister's family got the best new dog ever for their fam, in my opinion. She is so cute, exactly the sort of dog they go for, just great, but here is the best part... she in FAN-F\*CKING-TASTIC with the small children. SO good. And she's great with senior doggo of the fam, obviously has taken to her new Mom and Dad quite quickly. A fantastic dog, a fantastic family dog, wonderful.

So the only thing, and it's a small thing, is she is doing bork bork bork at us and presumably other guests when they come around the house, after she had been in her wonderful home a few weeks. I am concerned that my tips are based too much on my dog and they are different dogs. The parents are amazing, but I wonder if anyone has experienced something more similar before? I think my dog is too different and this is a bit unique I think.

So doggy so far has mostly borked at myself and my husband. We spent the first evening winning her over, and by the end she would happily pets, belly rubs, and things, however, she would still occasionally bark if we were across the room and moving about. It's worth noting she could possibly have bad eyesight although she is young, and we have 2 large dogs at home and must smell like them.

So today she still borked when we entered, and her Mom and Dad moved to tell her ""No"" and she stole her Mom's croissant, I'm told quite brazenly. There was many new people today too, and although she is good friends with my husband and I now (and we play and get face kisses and such) she still sometimes does alert barks across the rooms when we move about. She also got over excited and tried to grab a food from another family member and nipped her a bit by accident. It was a huge day today, so many new things.

I'm wondering, does it seem she might be getting over threshold with stress stacking? I'm so used to my dogs stuff I'm worried I could be giving the wrong advice. Should I help distract when she feels borky or ask her Mom and Dad to not discipline (very lightly of course, just saying no and a time out), or advise something else? They are amazing owners, amazing, and I'm just worried because I don't want to give advice based on my dogs and be wrong. I think I have some ideas, based on my dogs, but I want to make sure. Also as a trigger of borks I want to do whatever is most helpful of course.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had several dogs in my life, ""Poodle, Boxer, Chihuahua, Cocker spaniel, Another Poodle, and a pug, and none of my dogs have ever bitten anyone or even attempted to. Growing up in a really unstable and abusive household, my dogs never acted up. My parents have a pug that they have never ever taken on a walk or outside with several people, He's only been showered twice in his life and he turns 2 soon.

When my sisters wedding came and several people came to our house, My pug would watch and as people stuck their hands in his play area, he stood still and rubbed his head on their hands, it was very adorable. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dogs do bark at other dogs sometimes but they don't bite people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dogs aren't trained at all either. They're really calm, I can stick my head on their head and they wont lick me, most the time... 

&amp;#x200B;

My dogs are not well behaved at all, they are very stubborn. I was visiting a friend with the pug in a stroller and in the middle of the night the pug escaped and starting running around the room until I finally managed to catch him.

421,dogs,"Hi all,

Been thinking about getting a dog for a long time now, but with so much conflicting information, I thought I'd seek out some advice that was based on my specific circumstances. Most literature that I came across, other than being contradictory, doesn't overlap enough with my living situation for me to make a confident judgement. 

I live in London, with no access to a garden, though I live adjacent to a park (rather, a ""common""). I'm away from home 5 hours a day, and rarely on weekends. I do sometimes go out drinking on Friday night, though this is mostly out of boredom, and not something I wish to sustain (thus, happy to entirely abandon if needs be - would also welcome advise on socialising and what would be fair on the dog). Despite this relatively short daily absence, I'm still concerned that leaving a poor pooch on its own for this long would cause it discomfort.

I've been to countless websites in the pursuit of breeds that are docile and content with ""small"" periods of isolation (small, of course, being up for debate), as well as those that do not require an independent outdoor space. On several occasions, the Basset Hound has come up as a recommended breed. This being said, Is any breed of dog going to be OK at home for that period of time without another companion? 

As much as I would love to have a dog, I'm not going to burden one with a poorer quality of life just so I can be a dog owner. I realise it's a long term commitment, and these circumstances are unlikely to change for several years. Just wondered if said circumstances are remotely acceptable for dog ownership. 

For what little it's worth, I live with my long term girlfriend in a 55sq m flat that is very calm and predictable. That is to say, we don't have lots of random people over, aren't loud, and have a pretty routine lifestyle that follows a regular pattern. Neighbours are also quiet, though there is a dog a few doors down that barks for 20 minutes at 8pm every few days. We don't have children as yet, though may do in the next 5-10 years. 

Forgive me for such a selfish post that will likely do little to inform others, but I'm not sure where else I can get more legitimate advice.

422,dogs,"Okay, so.. I was walking my dog last night, around midnight. He's an alaskan shepherd, so fairly big, but has the heart of a kitten... A bang went off, and it spooked him, he managed to slip his harness and ran home. Luckily we were literally 20 seconds away, so I chased after him. As we got home there was a dog on the other side of the road who came to meet mine in the middle of the road (remember midnight so no cars, luckily) The owner of the other dog must have panicked and tried to push my dog away from his small yorkshire terrier type of dog and while doing so my dog didn't want to move as he was sniffing so ended up getting a little possessive, maybe? And the harder the guy tried to move him, the more my dog didn't want to be moved and I think he tried to grab the other dog.. He tends to grab something before it's taken away from him, but as he grabbed him I think he possibly cut the other dog and possibly the owners hand, as his teeth are quite sharp...   


Let me be clear though, he never once BIT anyone in this scenario, just his teeth scraping people as his mouth was open. Obviously if he bit someone, there would be carnage! 

The owner, rightfully so was upset and ended up in my face screaming that he's gonna call the police and get my dog destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

I sympathised and quickly ran my dog inside as we were right outside my home. After getting my dog in, a ran back outside to speak to the owners (him and his wife) and he was still having none of it, screaming in my face saying my dog is going to get destroyed, etc etc... I apologised as much as I could, he walked off, leaving his wife behind. I spoke to her, I gave my contact details and offered to pay for any potential vet bills. ( I didn't see any marks on the other dog, they wouldn't let me see, but I did see a small graze on his hand from where he seperated the two dogs)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is; is this enough to have my dog put to sleep, because I'm really panicking here.. He's never hurt anyone in his life, he just got spooked from a loud bang and they happened to be opposite our house with their dog off the lead who got the attention of my dog.

423,dogs,"Hello everyone, last week I adopted a 2 year old spayed poodle-mutt named Sage. We know she came from a neglectful home. She had only been fostered for about a week when I adopted her, which I had not known at the time.

I did everything I was supposed to with our other dog; long walks, smelling each other via towels/clothing, meeting on neutral ground, etc. When they finally got in the home together they were besties!

My other dog is a 2 year old spayed mix of everything mutt, she is super mild in temperament. She can be a bit abrasive when it comes to giving you kisses, but she is otherwise perfectly fine. She was my S/O's dog which he adopted 10 months ago, and I have been living with her for 6 months.

But as of last night, they have started fighting and it is rather hairy. They will go from cuddling together and grooming each other to having to be broken up in seconds. It has led to me being nipped, on accident ofc, but hard enough to bruise and draw blood.

I have read conflicting opinions on whether this is normal or if I should rehome Sage. I feel it is too early in the game to get a behavioral analyst as the closest one is an hour and a half away; and I feel it may be too soon to rehome her. With that said, I do not want to cause any undue stress or harm to Rosemary, and will do whatever I need to in order to keep both dogs safe and happy. 

I know there's only so much you can do from a computer screen. Just looking to see if I should try waiting it out a bit longer or if I should contact someone for her; which would break my heart.

425,dogs,"Thanks for the help. I am in a few breed-groups on FB and read owner testimonials about the breeds I am interested in and think that they are perfect and then I'll read other's experiences and think the complete opposite. I am very concerned about biting off more than I can chew with my next dog. 

I apologize for the formatting errors. I also deleted a few of the questions that I unknowingly answered before I got to them. 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* This will be my second dog. I lost my soul dog of 13 years in October of this year (2022) and I grew up and still do pet sitting so I am familiar and comfortable with dogs of all types and personalities. However, it's been many years since I've had a new-to-me dog and I have never had or raised a puppy. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†[reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I would prefer a reputable breeder but I am completely open to the right¬†rescue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

\* My last dog is and will always be my ideal, but obviously I am aware, prepared, and excited for the differences in my next dog. But I loved his personality traits and he fit my lifestyle so perfectly. I am looking for a homebody who still loves quiet adventures, a velcro dog, very biddable, can think independently, and either has a natural ability or can be trained to coexist with livestock and poultry. I have pretty strict aesthetic standards too (I know, I know). I prefer medium/large physically capable/sturdy breeds, medium/stock coats, upright ears, low tail carriage. I also appreciate intimidating-looking breeds and ones that are wary of strangers in appropriate situations. And the dream would be minimal shedding, but I already know that most of the breeds that I gravitate towards are heavy shedders.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I have been looking at quite a few breeds and would love to hear suggestions that are within my ‚Äútype‚Äù and outside it.

Beauceron, German shepherd, Berger Picard, Belgian shepherd, Smooth collie, Standard poodle

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Coexist with other animals with and without supervision, and good off-leash reliability. Recall I can work on, but I need to feel confident that my dog won't bolt out the door and down the street without a second thought.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\*  Possibly. I am interested in dog sports, but I have no experience or connections with them. I would be very interested in herding if the breed I end up with is inclined to it.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* 2 hours at least every day of specific exercise/mental stimulation, but the dog always be around for outdoor chores and activities. Someone is almost always home, I doubt the dog would be alone for more than 2 hours every day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* No dog parks ever, regular walks and farm chores.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I would prefer to do minimal serious brushing but I am open to learn if I need to.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* Medium/large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Low barking, low or no slobber, shedding is tolerable.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Extremely important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Both, I think. My last dog wasn‚Äôt a snuggler, but he was a total velcro dog. He would rarely invade personal space, but when I was standing around or sitting, he always had to be touching me in some way, with his foot or body. I don‚Äôt think I would mind a snuggly dog, I just don‚Äôt have any personal experience with one.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

\* Eager to please.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Protective, but able to think critically and with no aggression. Aloof with strangers.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

\* Human, dog, and other animal¬†aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

\* Poultry, goats, sheep, rabbits, possibly a cat in the future.

19) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* Not in the household, but they should be trustworthy with them under supervision.

20) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Winters are mild (lows fall between 27-50F) Summers are hot (highs between 85-110F)",t2_2q4affmh,0,ISO Breed suggestions,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üìùRecommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üìùRecommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,zx3s4j,True,jeannobean,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zx3s4j/iso_breed_suggestions/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zx3s4j/iso_breed_suggestions/,2475925,1672213600,0,,False,1672213617,1672213617,2022-12-28 07:46:40,,,,,,,
426,dogs,"I'm aware that redditors are always obsessed with Aww and wholesome, and they get even way too civil and respectful when anybody or any dog or animal shows up even though they did something bad, especially _animals_ because _they don't have a motivation just instinct_ . But when someone posts a picture of a dog that has a big head and short hair even if the dog did nothing wrong in it's entire life they go monke and only know to spam ""pitbull eat baby"" kind of jokes and if you try to show that not every dog is a pitbull and that pitbulls are a very pure breed limited to isolated farms where dogfighters and dogmen remain unspotted and that the dogs you see are way too big and wide to be pitbulls they go ballistic and attack you. 

I know this is me losing the battle, but it's just baffling how much dunning Kruger effect them redditors are on, taking sources from literally PETA or open source pages known for not being trusted sources of information. 

I have been attacked by a fakebull, and I went on the hate train for a good time until they taught me. And I've seen stuff and learned about the breed and it's misidentifications. Pit bull is not an umbrella term, and even yet if it were, the bull and terrier dogs (APBT, AST, EBT and EST/ IST) are known to be fairly neutral towards people. It is a fact that the more mixed up a dog is, the more it loses the selected traits, turning it into a wild animal. 

The origin of the kid eating pitbull comes from urban gangsters mixing dogo argentino with other breeds to get massive bulldogs with a predisposition to attack people. Mix them more and you'll get a dog that snaps when least expected.

429,dogs,"Hi!:) I have two dutch shepherd/belgian malinois mix, Eren and Azula. We got Azula when she was 3-4 months old, and Eren when he was 6-7 months old. They are siblings, but since we got Azula much earlier she didn‚Äôt developed any health problems unlike Eren. His previous owner didn‚Äôt take care of him and when we got him he was veeeery overweight and he could barely go to the bathroom and stuff. Well, we visited the doctor who said that he beat a very dangerous infection when he was younger and we should be prepared for a weight loss after he feels better in the new environment‚Ä¶etc. And he indeed lost weight but he just can‚Äôt gain back any. Since he is a shepherd I know that his figure will be slim? fit? but he is literally underweight.

430,dogs,"Today my puppy Maggie(2 y/o female Australian Shepherd) was sleeping peacefully in the bed that used to belong to my childhood cat who sadly passed away due to liver failure. She loves hanging around anything that has the scent of my cat but that's not the only thing that melts my heart. I was the one who got her but I was never sure if she looked to me as someone she could rely on. I would take on the world for her but in the back of my mind I didn't think she knew that until tonight. When sleeping my aunt walked downstairs to where we were. Maggie heard footsteps coming closer and went to investigate. Maggie loves people but in the dark my aunt emerged wearing all black and Maggie didn't notice till she was right in front of her and freaked out barking loud enough to wake the whole house and ran over to me and my brother for backup as well as to protect us and it took a minute but she realized everything was okay and went to apologize to my aunt but only after me my brother and now my mom were able to calm her down. After that we brought her upstairs to bed after giving her a couple carrots as treats for being so good even and alerting everyone of a possible threat without getting violent. She went into my room however and when I  came up for bed soon after I noticed her inside and invited her to up on my bed. She then layer down and went so sleep which she never did before (sleeping with someone in a bed that is) and I let her. My brother came up and decided to try and take her to her own bed but she walked right back into my room and jumped up on the bed and curled up right next to me immediately.

437,dogs,"I currently have a Maltese service dog in training because my service dog is getting old and is not preforming as well as before, he also seems to have less interest in being a service dog now. Once I took my SDIT Belle to a park to work on training. While we were there, we met this woman who we‚Äôll call K. K asked to pet Belle even though her vest says not to pet her, I told her that I‚Äôm training her right now and petting her would be a distraction for her. She asked why it‚Äôs a big deal and I explained to her what a service dog is and why you shouldn‚Äôt distract them, I asked her to please go away. She yelled at me, saying that dogs shouldn‚Äôt work and what I‚Äôm making her do is cruel. I once again told her to please go away. She threatened to call the police on me so I told her that service dogs are legal and it would be a waste of time to call the police. She then grabbed Belle and ran off. At that point I burst into tears. I ran towards the lady but lost track of her. I looked frantically for her everywhere but couldn‚Äôt find her. K sure wasn‚Äôt slow, but I was panicking which made me dizzy so I was slower. I eventually passed out but I can‚Äôt remember much that happened after that. The park was very close to my friend‚Äôs house, so I got up and went there hoping she was home and explained to her what happened. She comforted me and offered to help find Belle. We looked all around the neighborhood without finding Belle. My friend got a call from her mother telling her that dinner is ready, so she told me she‚Äôd be right back. Then after about 10 minutes of me looking for Belle, I saw K walking out a house to get a package. Part of me wanted to go and confront her, but I was too anxious to do so. I secretly took a picture of her house address. I wanted to get Belle back no matter what. After a while of hiding behind her fence thinking of plans, I heard her door open as she let Belle into her backyard. I waited for a bit before taking a peak and seeing Belle. I saw that K already went inside, so I immediately reached to grab Belle. 

The next day, I saw K again when I went to the dog park located next to that park I saw K at. I went to that dog park because my friend told me that friendly people and dogs go there and it‚Äôs a good place to let my service dog off-duty. I brought my service dog Cosmo there. I didn‚Äôt bring Belle because I was afraid that someone would attempt to steal her again. As I was about to enter the dog park, I saw K in the park nearby on her phone. She noticed me and ran up to me yelling to give the dog to her. I backed away from her and she ran to get a worker. She claimed I stole her dog. I called Cosmo over to me and told the worker that Cosmo‚Äôs mine. The worker told K to call the dog over to her but Cosmo ignored K. The worker said that the dog might be mine and for K tell him if she has proof Cosmo is hers. K ran away out of embarrassment.

442,dogs,"For context:
I have a female, 2 years, fixed, and house trained. All by myself. Also lived with a German Shepherd, Male, not fixed. He was a nightmare but I worked on him with my sister. He, as a pup, was always living in a house.
I‚Äôm experienced in working with dogs.

I recently adopted my girl‚Äôs, brother. They‚Äôre from the same litter from two years ago. I knew the owner personally.
I met with the dog multiple times and got to know him. He was an outside dog, only. He was trained pretty well with commands. He‚Äôs 2 years old, not fixed, and it‚Äôs going to be extremely tough to help him unlearn behaviors.

Here is my issue:
He‚Äôs clearly struggling with separation anxiety.
He flinches sometimes when we go to pet him.( I think the owner hit him and I would‚Äôve never suspected and this is very upsetting.)
He went from being the owners partner in crime, rode in the back of his truck to construction sites. Had free roam. Wasn‚Äôt walked, just ran in fields and hung out. 
Towards the last month or two prior to me adopting him, he was held in a back yard ‚Äúdog area‚Äù. I think this was a cage type of deal.
The owner ended up being in a position where he couldn‚Äôt keep him and had to keep him at this home till I could retrieve him. 

Here is what I‚Äôm worried about:
He went from absolute freedom in a suburban town to living in my one bedroom Apt with my girl and my bf.
He is struggling, especially because we are unable to walk him for very long due to the weather. He doesn‚Äôt get to be outside. I don‚Äôt have a back yard. (We are active with him and will get walked, Regularly, when it‚Äôs not pounding rain or snow.)

I‚Äôm more than willing to house break him, but I‚Äôm concerned that I should maybe help get him in a home where he still has that similar type of home. A back yard where he can run in circles. Where he has that access. He is extremely anxious. And bored.
He is also scheduled to get fixed in two weeks and I‚Äôm hoping this will assist in solving the marking behaviors and wanting to hump everything and the crazy energy.

I would like to get him mostly house broken before I consider adopting him out to a family with a big yard and a home for activity with kids and what not. And also try and work with any issues he might have from abuse. So far, there are no other issues other than flinching.

Any advice? Should I keep him and try and make it work? Or should I open opportunity for a family and a good home with WAY more room?",t2_uqzv2b7z,0,Adopted a Male Mutt.

449,dogs,"Hi there!

Here looking for training advice for my soon to be 1 year old male Border Collie. He‚Äôs from a cattle ranch in Texas so obviously meant to work work work. He is so lovely and kind, great with people and other dogs, worships the tennis ball. Truly the biggest issue he has is that he will not come to me under ANY circumstances if he is let off of his leash, unless we are playing with the ball. He‚Äôs not food motivated whatsoever(can hardly get him to finish his meals), so that training method hasn‚Äôt worked at all. I reward him with the ball when he comes to me and praise him like crazy, however, he has learned to run away from me once he has the ball. I call his name and he looks at me, knows what I want, and takes off in the opposite direction. I train and ride horses so once of the biggest things I was looking forward to when I got him as a a puppy was taking him on long rides, only I can‚Äôt do that for fear of him running away. He‚Äôs not yet neutered but will be next week. Looking for advice on improving his recall, would appreciate any tips!

450,dogs,"3 year old GSD. When we first got him, we gave him chicken dry food. His skin became really dry and itchy, so we avoid chicken now, and he's been on Purina Pro Plan Salmon for Sensitive skin/stomach large breed. Skin has been great, but his stools were always kind of wet and loose on it, so eventually switched to Purina Pro Plan Complete Essentials Salmon, and his stools are great on it. Eventually he became bored of it, so we started adding wet food, and he loves it. The wet food is PPP Sensitive skin/stomach Salmon - since I wasn't sure what else to start with. It has been over a month now since adding that and his stools are back to being wet. I'm wondering maybe he's getting too much fish oil causing the wet stools.

My question is what would be a good wet food to use? I see Hill's has good praise on here, and Royal Canin... but when reading their ingredients, it's all chicken broth, or chicken by-product, even though they're not a chicken flavored protein. That concerns me. Would I be okay to try mixing in Purina's beef flavor wet food with the Salmon dry food? Or is it not good to mix different proteins for the same meal like that?

We had a neighbor with a pitbull puppy who he clearly neglected. She was very sad, alone, and untrained (would jump on you if you passed by, barked up a storm, etc). Instead of taking her out, the owner would have her pee down the stoop/front steps. It was gross but so was the owner's whole treatment of the dog.

They moved out. We got a new neighbor who also has a dog. This one is small, quiet, but elderly. The owner also seems much more caring. However, they also leave dog pee dripping down the stoop steps. I initially thought maybe the dog is incontinent because of age, but then it occurred to me that maybe it's normal and I'm not familiar with it?

462,dogs,"So I have been looking up a lot already about this and I am really excited about it. 
BUT 

I want to clear out every freaking corner and get tips from wherever I can get. 
And I bet this is asked a 1000 times probably so I apologize for that... 

So I have 3 dogs, 5year old female, 9 month old male and 18 week old female. All 3 are shelties. 
And except for the oldest one, they are picky eaters. 
Now a problem we have had was some poo eating, which we quickly discovered was due to hunger feeling and we stopped it by spreading more meals over the day. 
But their food, grain (the bad grains) free, high meat quality and low meat meal is from very good quality, vet suggested and we mix flavours to keep it interesting. 
But... they seem, and mostly the youngest one, to loose interest. 
She still eats enough so nothing to worry about. 

Now 2 weeks ago they had a promo for barf food in the store. I asked for info and they explained a raw meat diet gives a more fulfilling feeling foodwise compared to hard pressed kibble. 
The burgers and sausages are frozen though so when we would go out of country (we go to Denmark on vacation but tbh, I think I can also buy there some.... :') ) it could be more difficult. So the guy suggested to also give 1 of the meals cold pressed kibble, which gets the same effect as the raw meat diet. However... even my 5 year old, who would eat a year old dead rat.... (figure of speech) won't even touch the cold pressed kibble of Farmfood. 
Now I want to try the brand: CanisPurus, which should be the #1 of cold pressed kibble cording my vet and the guy who gave the info. (Not a seller of that brand btw) 

I know barf contains everything a dog needs. Meat, vegetables, vitamins, minerals, etc. 
But I want to make sure I read that correctly. So want to ask here again if that is true.... 

If my sweethearts refuse the cold pressed kibble, how can I get them used to it. It would idd make travel easier if they can eat jist 5 days the kibble without me having to look for the frozen food in a foreign country. 

Also, the male dog has a strong heartbeat. He has a small rush which is caused by his heart beating so strong the blood gets pushed through the valves. It is nothing bad, and even gives him a lot more oxygen to work with during training. But the cardiologist said to add taurine to his food. 
Taurine adding... does not exist here for dogs. Only for cats. 
But there is a nice taurine volume in a raw meat diet. So it would also be beneficial for his heart to keep it strong. 

So please, give me some extra info ^^ Is your dog on a raw meat diet? Have you seen improvement? Like softer fur, stronger muscle, less chance on getting chubby.... 
Hit me with knowledge please.

She probably won't be fully swimming much (regardless she will always have her life vest on) but she will be in water probably up to her chest at that point. She will be on a leash on a boat at the lake so she cant jump off into the water.

470,dogs,"It's my first time posting here so I'm sorry if the format is wrong. My fiance and I got our first dog in January (bernese mountain dog), and he was the best thing that ever happened to us. We named him Bear and gosh did he just love everything about life and people. We had issues with him desperately trying to eat socks right from the time we brought him home, and at 9 months he ate a sock that just didn't come out. We got an $8,000 surgery to remove it, and we told ourselves we just had to ask everyone who comes over to put socks in a large bin to make sure accidents don't happen again. Bear stayed sick a while after his surgery, so we started putting a towel in his kennel as he hated getting puke in his house. Well, he then ate some of the towel laid out in his kennel which sent him straight to surgery again. We paid over $11,000 for the surgery as all the pieces had wrapped around in his organs, and we picked him up 3 days after just so excited to start fresh. We reformed the house to be so sure that absolutely nothing could happen again. Took him home, and 3 days into recovery he couldn't be touched without yelping. He never recovered and formed rare adhesions that stuck to his sides, and we had to put him down. 

It's been a few months since he passed and I can't believe how much it still brings me so much pain to miss waking up to him, my buddy constantly following me around and sitting at my feet, my cuddler. I feel dramatic knowing that I didn't lose a person, but I honestly feel like I lost my child and that I failed trying to save my dog. We spent almost $20,000 in a small chunk of time to try to save him but he still died. We feel so defeated and alone and sad.

I have put a ton of work into her with counter conditioning and engagement games/rewards. It is has taken me a really long time to trust her.

We had been working on a long line to eventually get to the point of being able to go off leash. It was a dream but it didn't seem likely to ever actually be in our future.

Today we were on our road doing some heeling on the long line. For some reason today felt like the day. She was in a great headspace and very focused. She was also muzzled, as we're in the process of conditioning right now.

With the factors stated above in consideration, I felt confident in myself and my dog. I kept a traffic lead on her collar as an emergency back up if I needed it.

SHE DID AMAZING. She heeled the entire time, even when changing directions. She performed moving cues like a champ. 

We did not see anything today that I would consider a trigger, and I know that that will be a different ballgame. For this reason I have set up times with friends to work on structured training with her off leash and muzzled near their dogs, which I think will be a huge help.

I wanted to share this, because it is such a big moment for us. I feel like we've worked so so hard to get here. I could not be more proud of my now focused, happy girl.

494,dogs,"Z is 5 years old, small breed, female. I got her from a shelter that said she is house trained. She is spayed, and we have had her 5 days. We have an older dog, 10 yo small breed, that goes out every 3-5 hours. It depends on the weather if we can keep him out what we feel is long enough because it's cold where we live and we just take him more frequently. The first 3 days Z did not have urinary accidents in the house. She wasn't drinking a lot. Yesterday, she had 2 accidents, but she still urinated outside 2 or 3 times. The times she does eliminate outside we give her a treat and lots of praise.

Now, today is even worse, even though it is warmer today than it has been since we had her (still 17F out there). We have taken her out every 2 hours, and 3 times she walked in and urinated on the floor 1-2 minutes after walking back in. About 20 mins ago, my partner took her out for about 8-10 minutes, then came back and said she didn't do anything so I took her back out and she wouldn't move, just sat down on the porch. She's done this in previous days and we have picked her up and taken her to the end of the drive way and she will walk back to the door, pee in the drive way and go back in the house. But now she just sits at the end of the drive way and twirls around in a circle standing in the same spot, and the leash twirls around her neck or just sits there? 

I am baffled why this would happen after 5 days and why she is eliminating directly after being outside. Especially when it's not as cold as previous days, so she is staying outside longer.

She also doesn't always get on with our dog and 2 cats. Just growls or barks for no known reason. It isn't all the time and I've been chalking it up to her adjusting. One of us is always around.

We've rescued 4 dogs (3 adults) in the past, and no one had such a difficult adjustment. I feel awful for wanting to just take her back.

495,dogs,"TLDR; looking for a large, social, moderately active apartment dog but not sure of what breeds to look into


 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have previously had a mini poodle and a Chow Chow mix for a few years. I absolutely loved our Chow Chow and taught her basic commands on my own. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]?

* I‚Äôm open to a dog that was from a breeder though I want an adult dog. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Adult dog, medium to large size, moderate activity level that I can take on 2-3 walks per day and to the dog park, social that would be comfortable around friends or taking to a bar, affectionate when at home that would cuddle up on the couch or to sleep

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I loved our Chow Chow mix but her personality may not have been typical for the breed so I‚Äôm looking for advice. I like Great Pyrenees but have read they are typically bad apartment dogs. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* very basic commands - no job to do 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* no competitions or work for the dog in my future! 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I‚Äôll spend the majority of the day with my dog, but will tropically be gone for 8-10 hours daily. But I plan on doing a few 30min - 1 hour walks daily and training with meals. As well as lounging on the couch all evening. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* probably 2-4 hours of exercise daily which would include walks and dog parks mostly 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

*  absolutely used to and open to doing my own grooming (very used to shaving the mini poodle and brushing the chow chow previously) 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

*medium or large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* any amount of shedding is acceptable, prefer to have a quieter dog but okay with some barking, prefer as little slobber as possible

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*this would be nice but not a necessity 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* able to be alone for a few hours but trainable and responsive to training 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*  Initially to bark/alert but listen to my commands to calm down and able to be social 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* no 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* no

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-10 hours 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*. It will just be me and the dog! 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*. Nope but family and friends I visit have dogs

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* not currently but maybe in the next 5 years 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* currently renting - no restrictions 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Louisville, KY - no restrictions 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* winter : mid-20s summer: mid- 70s

504,dogs,"Hello, everyone,

Prior to COVID, my now 5yr old German Shepp/Husky did fine going to the vet and receiving his animal checkups and vaccinations.  Ever since I was no longer able to go inside the visits with him, everything has changed.  The vet will no longer see him without being completely under anesthesia due to being overly aggressive.

I tried switching vets thinking something may have happened at the previous clinic but that is not the case.  The new vet also wants to put my dog under even for vaccinations.

I'm now able to go in with him to the appointments and my dog turns into a completely different animal.  The most gentle and loving dog goes into survival mode and acts as if everyone is out to get him; I've never seen him so aggressive outside of the vet.

I'd really like to avoid full sedation.

Here is what I've tried with the vets recommendation:

- Gabapentin and Trazodone a day prior and day of vet visit
- CBD treats
- Going in with him and waiting out in the car
- Muzzle

If anyone has any tips/recommendations, I'm all ears.  I'm worried that long-term sedation for every visit isn't the best option health wise.

We can brave the rain to his spot and the whole time, he's frantically trying to get back inside.  He actually pulled a muscle in his back during his freak out yesterday.

Its been over a year since my girlfriend and I have been together so he‚Äôs not as aggressive anymore, but I‚Äôve also learned not to do certain things around him. I don‚Äôt know his exact age but he‚Äôs at least 4 years old in human years. He‚Äôs more comfortable with me now then when we first started dating, but we still have our moments when we‚Äôre sort of stand-off ish. Anyways recently I‚Äôve been noticing that Pancho retrieves the toilet paper that has semen on it and eats it. I tell me girlfriend to flush it instead of just throwing it in the trash, but I find it weird that he does that. I ask her to do that because I don‚Äôt think toilet paper is good for his digestive system, and I don‚Äôt want him to hurt himself doing that. He‚Äôs done this a few times now and it‚Äôs usually when my girlfriend forgets, but I just can‚Äôt help but wonder why he does that. I think it‚Äôs because he sees me as competition, or he thinks he the alpha or something of that nature. Which is silly to me because he‚Äôs a dog, but I don‚Äôt know.

517,dogs,"After months of consideration I took the leap and adopted a senior chiweenie from a shelter. Unfortunately some challenges have come up. Idk if I'm looking for advice or just need to vet. 

My beloved little boy has now bit both my grandsons and is not welcome at either home again. I was forced to leave him alone for several hours on Christmas Eve. He has terrible seperation anxiety so I was terribly sad about having to leave him behind. He did fine as far as I know aside from one messy accident on the carpet which is understandable. I tried utilizing training pads but he will not use them. He was so happy to see me and now won't leave my side which is also understandable. 

I'm currently not employed so I can't afford a sitter. I would like to return to work after the first of the year but it will be difficult if not impossible to leave him alone for more than a few minutes. I have a wifi camera I can check on him when i'm away from the house. Sometimes he barks the entire time i'm gone (up to a couple hours) and sometimes he simply naps on the back of the couch until i return. 

He is such a sweet companion I would never consider getting rid of him. He waited several months to be adopted I just couldn't do that to him again since he's become so attached to me. But the lack of independence does get to me at times. 

He also has frequent accidents in the house even with frequent bathroom breaks outside. We live in a cold climate so getting him to go outside is a battle some days. Most friends w/o small children are welcoming when I visit but I must keep a sharp eye on him to prevent him going to the bathroom in their homes which makes visits anxious for me. I frequently take him along on errands and leave him in the car when necessary which seems to suit him just fine. He waits patiently for me at times napping in his blankets i have in the car for him. 

The other issue is his vision. I was not aware he has cataracts at the time I got him but they have progressed rapidly in the last 7 months to the point that the vet says he has no vision in one eye and very little in the other. Idk if anyone here has advice for owners of blind dogs. I'm a bit unhappy with the shelter I adopted him from for not disclosing his cataract issues or his issues with seperation anxiety. His foster parents didn't indicate any problems with him during our meet and greet even tho I did ask.

518,dogs,"I adopted a very nervous Aussie mix (about 5 years old now) from a kill shelter last year. He was there because he had a bite history with a kid, and I knew that going into it. He has a very strong fear response and lunges when he's scared. I didn't realize how bad it was until he mouthed a runner's leg at the dog park and nipped a kid at my parents house (when I had no idea they were going to have a kid there). He bit another guy (no puncture or shaking) because he was shouting and running at us. 

I've done training with him to get over his fear of bikes and people. I don't let him anywhere near children and I keep him on a short leash if we're passing people on walks. He doesn't lunge anymore as long as he's on a short leash, except yesterday.

I was talking on the phone and we were passing a guy in a mask on a trail. I put him on a shorter leash and had my body between him and the guy. For whatever reason, he lunged at the guy and may have made contact with his teeth.

I'm distraught. From day one I've worried that my own incompetence would get him sent back to a kill shelter and euthanized. I'm going to continue working with him: giving more space on walks, staying on short leash near people, giving treats when we pass people, and controlling my anxiety so I don't make things worse.

I‚Äôm thinking about moving to an area with a lot of snow in the future and when the time is right I‚Äôd like to get a dog that would enjoy all that snow and being active in the snow with me.

524,dogs,"TL;DR: how do you know when your dog is near the end? What symptoms are most common and what can I expect?

Timeline: my 4 year old lab was diagnosed with lymphoma in April. She went through a few different types of chemo, but none resulted in a durable remission. We stopped chemo and have been on prednisone since September. So almost 4 months on pred alone, which is much longer than I expected.

Her biggest lymph node is on one side of her neck. It's probably the size of a baseball. The past few weeks, I've noticed she's been snoring louder, which makes sense since her node is pressing on her throat. In the last couple days, she's been making weird noises after eating or drinking, almost like she's struggling to swallow. She's usually fine after awhile but it's making me concerned.

528,dogs,"I‚Äôve had my pup since she was 8 weeks old, she‚Äôs now 7 months. she‚Äôs made so much progress, is very well trained (I get a lot of comments about this!) very cute (a lot of comments about that too!) loving, fun, playful, curious, active, funny and sweet. 

when getting a puppy, I knew I was going to be sacrificing or saying goodbye to a big part of my social life, both during the puppy phase and overall as I know having a dog is a big commitment. but I must admit, I‚Äôm feeling a little isolated right now and distant from everyone.

my pup is a little shy. I thought I socialised her the best I can, maybe she just has a reserved personality. her breed is supposed to be one that is social and merry so I guess it‚Äôs a little out of character and wasn‚Äôt quite what I was expecting. I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs fearful - she‚Äôs just quietly confident? prefers attention from the people she knows most and nobody else?

as mentioned, I knew I would be waving bye bye to social activities. but, I did think I could maybe find alternatives such as having friends over or taking my pup to dog friendly places with friends or to their houses if they were okay with that. every friend/family‚Äôs dog I‚Äôve met has been so excited to meet/see me when I‚Äôve visited so I guess I thought my puppy would be the same. 

turns out she isn‚Äôt very comfortable with guests, so I don‚Äôt have people visit. she is more comfortable coming with me to different places, but still doesn‚Äôt like attention from others so I can‚Äôt really socialise as I have to (rightfully) prioritise her and focus on her body language etc. it‚Äôs strange because she‚Äôs fine at the vets and the groomers, being handled there, but will quietly and calmly move away from someone (apart from me and family) if they go to pet her or get too close. I always completely respect this as that‚Äôs her boundary! I try to advocate for her as much as I can, telling strangers not to pet and encouraging my friends to let her approach on her own terms.

it might be important to mention that I DID socialise her. from around 8-12 weeks I showed her the world from a little puppy sling, didn‚Äôt let everyone approach her or overwhelm her, but did introduce her to new people and places. then from 12 weeks she was allowed on walks and we did the same, taking things very slowly and always taking a step back if she ever seemed even slightly unsure. making everything positive. she‚Äôs never (to my knowledge) had a negative experience with people so I‚Äôm not sure what more I could‚Äôve done really :(

I‚Äôve never left her home alone yet as I WFH and she‚Äôs so used to me being around I need to work on building up confidence and alone time. I‚Äôm working on showing her it‚Äôs safe without me, starting by hopefully being able to leave a room without her worrying. so I can‚Äôt even do anything solo at the moment either.

does anyone have any advice? she loves dogs so I am debating trying to find a good, trustworthy dog daycare to take her to 1x a week or so. I‚Äôve also been introducing her to my friends VERY slowly. getting them to essentially ignore her until SHE decides she will approach. providing them with high value treats to reward her with if she does. making sure these sessions/experiences are short as not to push her too far. if I were to visit a friends house and she was uncomfortable, I would leave straight away. I would always put her needs first and never let her get distressed.

(PS: hope this doesn‚Äôt sound like ungrateful whining. I really enjoy my time with her, I just wasn‚Äôt expecting to feel quite so isolated. I was never expecting to get her and just leave her to go off and have fun, but the fact that I can‚Äôt see anyone at the moment is really difficult. oh well! any advice would be great but it‚Äôs not the end of the world!)",t2_7w0r30xk,0,advice for lonely owner of shy pup?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zwltq3,True,glowvie,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zwltq3/advice_for_lonely_owner_of_shy_pup/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zwltq3/advice_for_lonely_owner_of_shy_pup/,2475698,1672164341,0,,False,1672164358,1672164358,2022-12-27 18:05:41,,,,,,,
529,dogs,"This is my first post on reddit. Please excuse formatting/spelling/grammer mistakes. English is not my first language.

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I'll answer for me and my partner. They have owned two dogs beforehand -  a Golden Retriever (was 12 weeks old, was also a family dog) and an Australian Shepherd (was 1,5 years old, their own dog). They also helped raising their fathers Australian Shepherd puppy.

My first co-owning dog was my partners Australian Shepherd, he was 9 years old when I met him.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would like a dog who is at least 1 year old, if he were from a reputable breeder that would be a plus.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

My partner needs a companion/assistance dog for social interactions (going to the city, meeting new people). They need a dog to excercise (jog, hiking, riding a bicycle, etc) and want to train them (dog tricks, maybe agility).

I like companion dogs to go on walks/hiking together. I like to cuddle dogs and I would like to train the dog (dog tricks). The primary care-giver would be my partner.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Not too small nor too big dog breeds. We both like longer fur.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Don't know what to say besides the answer to question 3.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

The dog should be an assistance dog/emotional support dog. My partner trained their Australian Shepherd to fullfill these tasks. The dog will not compete in sports and will not be working with other animals.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We both work 20hr/week and would be willing to dedicate most of our free time to the dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

On average we would have 3-6 hours on a weekday, weekends would be 12-14 hours. We would also arrange dog meetings.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

In the past the Australian Shepherd was brushed regulary (about once a week?). We are willing to groom at home.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Neither too small (for example a Yorkshire Terrier) nor too big (bigger than an Australian Shepherd).

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Barking: neighbours need to be accepting.
Shedding: It's ok to shed.
Slobber: Not too much. It's ok when the dog awaits food (and when he gets older).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be very nice.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

My partner prefers dogs who accompany you but don't need to be cuddled, I like to cuddle with dogs.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

We think ""eager-to-please"" fits the dog description more.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

He should alert us, but should also be calmer when he notices that the visitors are welcome. Our last dog greeted with barking and then showing off his dog toys.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

We want to avoid hunting cats/smaller animals.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On average 3-4 hours a day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

See answers to question 3; my partner would be the primary care-giver (training/excercising/walking/socialising), I would jump in when my partner doesn't have time/is stressed/sick.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

We might have guinea pigs in the future.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

We don't have children and don't plan to have children. Other family members do have children, we meet very unregularly.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We do rent, we don't have breed/weight restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Banned breeds:
American Staffordshire Terrier
Bull Terrier
Pit Bull Terrier
Staffordshire Bull Terrier

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

534,dogs,"So our new puppy is a 3 month old male Rottweiler and he‚Äôs been with us for about 3 days (yes, a Christmas present but a planned for one, the timing just worked out that way). My two older dogs are both neutered male German Shorthaired Pointers, Louie, 9 and Murphy, 4. 

I realize we socialized Louie better, he was the third dog in the house when he arrived and played frequently in a pack of friends‚Äô dogs. Murphy joined us and its been just him and Lou (plus cats). Life just changed (and a pandemic kept us away) and those socializing opportunities weren‚Äôt as available for him, but there‚Äôs been no behavior problems (except M will wake up snapping if L steps on him). 

Now we have the puppy and Murphy doesn‚Äôt seem to know what to do and shows signs of being stressed, holding his tail down, walking wide of the puppy, and has now growled and snapped/bit him 3 times. Mostly its proximity, last night was the first time he bit him and the puppy was just walking by the couch as Murphy laid there. The puppy is very calm and submissive, when the big dogs smell him he gives them his belly. He isn‚Äôt a bothersome puppy either, in the sense he isn‚Äôt biting or pawing them or harassing the older dogs at all.  

The older dogs have free reign on 10 acres, but I‚Äôve been walking them in 1/2 mile loops with the puppy 3-4 times a day since he arrived (older dogs unleashed, puppy leashed) plus frequent short jaunts. Initially Murphy seemed to go from interested to hyper focused on the pup outside and knowing how gsp‚Äôs can be obsessive I have been correcting and redirecting that behavior. Our walks are going well, and several times M has attempted to play with the pup.

Inside, he‚Äôs growling and avoiding him especially in the morning. Much of the time its going smoothly, smelling him, eating, being around eachother, but the times it isn‚Äôt M seems stressed and the pup is getting nipped. No blood or punctures so far, and no further aggression after the snap. But, counting that as a positive seems like grasping at straws. 

I do have gps e-collars both the older dogs are trained on, and today put one on M inside and have begun using the tone to assist in warning him to stop growling. Its helping, but its not going to fix his stress and avoidance and get him back to happy and relaxed. Louie is  unperturbed but also uninterested in the pup so there‚Äôs not much in the way of modeling appropriate play behavior.

I have a muzzle and am considering leash walking the two together while M wears it to work on him being easy with the puppy in his space. I‚Äôm using lots of positive reinforcement with verbal praise and tiny treats for all three, being careful not to lavish attention on just the puppy.

536,dogs,"Background: I adopted a dog about 2 months ago. He's been very friendly, playful, and affectionate towards myself and other people in my life. He is from a shelter and not too much is known about his life before, however. I'm thinking he's had a previous owner, as he knows some basic commands like ""sit"" and ""stay.""  


In the past couple days, his behavior has felt off. He's not as friendly and he has been lying around a lot. Smiles less.  It's made me worry that he's upset with me or unhappy. I'm wondering if he's exhausted from Christmas festivities with my partner (we stayed at his house for a couple of days) and several of his friends. My partner's home was a new environment for him, and I'm thinking maybe he got overwhelmed by company? I don't know if he's been around 10 other people before. I did put him upstairs eventually after he actually nipped at my partner's friend. I've noticed some sudden resource guarding going on with his toys, too. As for his health, he's eating fine. His poops haven't been unusual. He's still maintaining energy on our walks - and even ran with me briefly last night.

549,dogs,"
My dad‚Äôs wife has been keeping 6 dogs for a breeding business but I‚Äôm concerned about the mistreatment of them as they are left in cages all day in their own excrement. I‚Äôve brought this up several times about how they should be trained or given shelter outside so that there‚Äôs less clean up but no efforts have been made.

She claims she‚Äôll do that when she gets her new house (context: she originally moved in until she got a house as my dad is already in the process of divorcing her), but it‚Äôs been months and no signs of her getting a house anytime soon. My dad already has the money to potentially solve the issue; installing a fence, and hiring a professional to get the dogs trained, etc.

I brought up my concerns to my dad and he called it a nuisance as she would be moving out eventually and he wants to keep the peace so that she signs the divorce papers. In the past, at our old home, she has gotten violent at the threat of divorce even reaching for my dad‚Äôs gun amidst an argument. In fact, my dad initially moved locations to get away from her for safety reasons but they ended up getting back together anyways.

Should I convince my dad to get the dogs trained or should I get my step mom to give up on it altogether? I can‚Äôt see it being safe to call the police at the moment, I don‚Äôt know her very well and I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôll be violent again.

552,dogs,"My boyfriend and I have a male yellow lab, who will be ten years old in a couple months. 

Up until this point, he has been perfectly housebroken. Never had accidents in the house, except for on extremely rare occasions when he was sick. I can count on one hand the amount of accidents he's had, up until now. 

Just recently he's started peeing on the floor multiple times a week. He usually does it during the night or early morning, even though we always let him out to potty before bedtime. The funny thing is he *always* does it in the same spot- by the window in our front room. 

When it first started, I took him to the vet since it is such unusual behavior for him. The vet ran several tests and examined him thoroughly, but was unable to find anything medically wrong.

There have been no changes in our home, no shifts in our routine that could be causing our dog stress. I'm not sure what to do. He is a big dog, nearly one hundred pounds, so when he pees there is a ton of it. It takes a ton of effort to clean up, and makes the room smell so bad. The room is carpeted, so it's a bitcg to clean.

I've thought about putting pee pads down in the spot by the window, but I'm unsure because I don't want him thinking that's where he's ""supposed"" to go. I also proposed the idea of waking up at 3 AM every night to let him out, but my boyfriend is not a fan of that idea.

Other than this recent development, he is acting completely normal-eating like usual, and being just as active as usual.

555,dogs,"We currently have Booster (almost 12 year old male) and Hera (almost 6 month old female puppy). Booster doesn't mind Hera so much, except he has *zero* desire nor interest in playing with her. Meanwhile, all Hera wants to do with her big brother (or any other dog she meets) is play.

We've had Booster just about 4 years now, and Hera for just about 4 months.

We currently keep them as separate as possible; during the day we're almost always in our office, so we have Hera in there with us with a baby gate to keep her contained. But the concern is that when she's a little older and we want to let her roam free that she won't know to leave big brother alone.

So, we've considered getting a 3rd dog. Not only have we wanted a 3rd dog anyway, we're hoping that if we get one that's out of the puppy phase but not too old that they'll be a good role model and playmate for Hera.

Is it better to get another male dog? Or another female dog? 

We know from when Hera has gone over to someone's house for dog sitting that she reacts well to older male dogs, so that's our initial thinking, but we're also concerned as to how Booster would react to another male. For a little more background on him, we got him as a 2nd dog we we had a current female dog (Jade, our goodest of good girls that we had to say goodbye to in August at nearly 16).

Any and all input/experience/advice is greatly appreciated.

566,dogs,"My Ex-Wife has rescued a lovely dog and his temperament and behaviour are great. He's brilliant with our teenage children and when younger relatives have visited he's been very patient. He's 2 now and over the past 12 months he's settled in really well and there are zero intentions of giving him up, he's got his forever home and everyone in the house adores the dog.

His former owner was a guy who drank in the local pub i go to. He was not treating him well so when he got fed up with his puppy i gladly took him to my ex-wife who wanted a dog and i knew would give this little fella the love he deserves. It's been about 14 months now since they adopted the dog and he's fitted right in. 

This awesome beautiful dog was left for prolonged periods, locked in a kitchen until night time when his owner came home and was rarely walked. We're talking a full day. The partner of the owner would come home, leave him in the kitchen still because she couldn't cope with him being a puppy and had a baby and finally when the owner finally came home the kitchen was usually a mess with the bins knocked over and of course the poor dog had gone to the toilet a few times!

When my ex-wife and her husband leave for work, they have arrangements in place so he's not left for more than 4 hours ever. My Ex-Wife works part time and is home majority of the time anyway but on those rare occasions they don't want the dog to be anxious and left for too long which i think is the right approach.

None of this is a chore to my Ex-Wife, her husband or the kids!

The issue is thedog out of learned habits immediately uses the kitchen as the toilet when people go out and he's closed in there. He chewed through the kitchen door once to get out which my ex-wife didn't get cross about, she felt it was probably anxiety related. I think that could be the case as he is NOT destructive at all in anyway and has never done damaged to furniture or anything else. He's got used to the idea of being closed into the kitchen for a short period of time, but we want to help him master his toilet habits a bit better and of course do what we can to reduce any anxiety he has.

i suggested pads on the floor to start with to help him have a place to go if he feels the need and maybe even a long term solution if needs be?

574,dogs,"Hi my dog was diagnosed 1 day ago and the diagnosis was kinda quick (?) the test only showed a faint line but my vet already diagnosed him with parvo. 

He was confined and he needs to be confined for 3 days. My dad has some friends who had parvo dogs and one of them had 7 dogs that died because of parvo. He told us that the 4th day since the dog has been diagnosed is where it all matters. The 4tg day determines whether the dog's condition is good or bad. 

Today is the second day and my loki has started eating the chicken we bought him (boiled chicken was recommended by the vet so it can boost his appetite) but the vet updates told us that he unfortunately threw it up but he does not have diarrhea anymore. Vet also told us that he has been very active which I am so happy about. We are going to visit him today :)

575,dogs,"My Father-in-law has a dachshund that growl and bite without warning. It is fed from the table and steals food from the plate as soon as has to leave the chair. It is treated like a youngster, but without clear boundaries. 

This behaviour is also accepted when we invite Father-in-law to dinner party at our house with family guests. I have said to my wife that the dog should be kept in the hallway when we are eating in our house, as long as it steels from the plate and constantly begs for food. I get stressed and lose appetite with this kind of dog behaviour. But my wife puts my father-in-law and the dog's needs before mine.

Problem behavior is excused from a human point of view. In addition, the dog doesn't get the exercises it needs, only very short walks. In my view the dog has no boundaries, and unwanted behaviour are free to evolve, and the lack of exercise have created a understimulated and insecure dog. However, my wife and her family haven't taken me seriously, and my wife have claimed that I hate dogs. I grew up with dogs, and I love dogs, I think a dog should be treated with love, but one should have in mind their natural behaviour in terms of needs and treatment. 

I have been concerned about this dog keeping since the dog interact with our kids. Recently I got a ware of that it has growl and bite without warning, and it has done so for a long time. But still no changes in the dog keeping has been undertaken. Some days ago, during family dinner, my wife got bitten when she put her hand on the dog when it was peeing on the floor, it bit without warning. The bite was deep and she got hospitalized for two days with antibiotics. My father-in-law was in the room and he reacted by apologizing to the dog and coming up with various alternative explanations for why this happened, heavily influenced from a human's point of view. The bit gave no consequences for the dog. 

I am now struggling to get through to my wife that the children should have nothing to do with the dog until it is trained. They still believe that the my father-in-law has control and that it is okay for the children to be with the dog as long as an adult is present.

580,dogs,"A week or so ago, I took my 5 year old German shepherd mix (adopted her 3 months ago) to a nearby park. During the trip, for the first time since we adopted her, she played fetch and got a lot of praise/treats. We played with a disc and also a rope and she was engaged very well with both. There were no other dogs at the park during our visit.

The next time I took her, it was after work so there were many folks there with their dogs. She got along pretty well with them all and ran around a bit. She played with her toys a bit, but significantly less than that first instance. 

The time after this (always going to the same park), we went after work again and she saw some dogs from last time, but she got really hyperfixated on these holes in the ground and started digging. She would put her whole head in and her face was so covered in dirt. The only treat (I've been trying other treats this whole time) she responded to was a bully stick, so we threw that around for her to ""fetch"" and she was nice enough to drop it when I asked her to so she got some exercise that way. 

The most recent two times, we didn't have any bully sticks and she ran right to the holes and started digging. Even if another dog approached her she stayed focused on the digging (no aggression though). We took her to another park and she played a little with the other (new) dogs but then started sniffing around for holes to dig. 

I can't give her a bully stick everyday to distract her from the digging when we go to the park, but even when I enthusiastically try to get her to play (I'm jumping around, waving the toy around, I run to try and get her to run with me - which has worked in the past but not anymore), she doesn't even look at me and just looks for more holes to dig. 

I don't know what happened between the one time she was really good with the toys/fetch and now, but I worry I can't take her to the park for a while and I wonder if she will even forget about these holes. She plays fetch at home fine, and she doesn't dig when we go on walks or anything, and at home she still is good with our cats (she knows not to chase them and leaves them alone when we tell her to - we are training her right now). So nothing has changed at home as far as I can tell.

Any advice on this is appreciated as she is my first dog. I'd love for her to get exercise outside of just simple walks and she used to really love running (we'd run alongside each other at the park even if she didn't play fetch and she seemed to enjoy it).

581,dogs,"So last night on Xmas, my senior poodle who we‚Äôve had for over 11 years was acting like normal. He was just laying down napping by the couch, I pet him, then looked away for a moment and he got up and started lifting a paw, (he usually does that before jumping up and dancing to let us know he has to pee or he‚Äôs hungry/thirsty) so we just through ‚Äúoh how cute‚Äù but then he seemed off. He started trying to walk but he was limping not putting that paw down, we thought he had hurt his paw or had something stuck on his paw, but then he switched paws so we knew something was wrong, we picked him up but he wasn‚Äôt whining or anything like that so we massaged his legs and put him back down down, but he was walking abnormally, like as if he couldn‚Äôt coordinate his legs and just moving weirdly, he was trying but clearly struggling. Then he went to one of his corners by the couch and a table (he usually goes there when he wants to be left alone because it‚Äôs hard to reach) after a few seconds and some quick thinking I acted as If I was going to get him one of his snacks and he came out of his spot better. He still wasn‚Äôt walking as perfectly  but had better coordination. After that we just let him rest with my mom and let him sleep (checking up on him every hour to make sure he was fine) I tried calling an emergency vet clinic but no doctor was in within a 3hr radius. I called this morning to try and get him an appointment but doctors are all out until next week. Today he seemed better he was waking and acting normally again.

583,dogs,"Hi there! I'm making this post on behalf of my family.

My Aunt and her family were over for Christmas. While they were at my house, her Collie Mix (5 years old) killed their Russel Terrier mix(?) (He was 15 and was in a health decline.) They lived together for 5 years. Lately she had been showing signs of food aggression, but they had all been left alone on thanksgiving just fine.

Her other two dogs were not harmed, But would not come out from hiding for hours.

My aunt's family was distraught, and I didn't want my aunt to see her dog  with blood on her while she was already so heart broken, so My brother and I brought her Collie to our house so the family can grieve. (I also didn't think they'd make the responsible choices in their emotional state.)

My aunt has other pets, all smaller than the collie. For everyone's safety the Collie will not go back to their home. I told my Aunt I would take care of the situation.

My brother and I have called vets and rehabbers, but none specialize in dog aggression, and most recommended putting her to sleep. From what we're reading, that may be the safest option, though we hate the idea of it being the only solution.

I'm curious to find answers, but I'm also financially unable to care for their pet long term or pay a vet bill to get her looked at. ((Which is why I do not have a pet, as much as I want one.)) 

We've considered rehoming her, letting people know she has killed a dog before and needs to be alone and watched, but I worry it may happen again, as there seem to be no local resources.

What should I do? 

She seems to be a VERY Anxious Collie, I have never seen a dog so scared, timid, and anxious. My previous dog (Maltese) had separation anxiety, and at 16, had become incredibly more anxious as he suffered from canine cognitive dysfunction / Dementia. He did not have these intense scared eye stares.

&amp;#x200B;

My observations of her are below:

\----------------------------

5 year old female dog - Collie Mix, given to them by a farmer. Seems perfectly well fed.

Lived with 3 other dogs (And multiple budgies and birds) for 5 years, with mild aggression, no harm but has been removed from scuffles with others once in awhile.

Stayed 2 weeks alone with all dogs while family was away just fine.

Lately has shown signs of food aggression despite adequate access.

Attacked and fatally harmed much smaller older, weaker, dog while family was away for Christmas.

I Picked up at night: Very wary, very frozen, pulled away from lead. (May have been hit by her owner who found the scene and got angry) - had to be somewhat carried to get into the car.

When unloading: froze halfway to the gate in the front yard, hunkered down, would low growl at anyone standing or walking by. (Had everyone back off) Was not at all food motivated to be placed in a secure yard. Would genuinely not budge.

Eventually was brought in through the front door and placed in a secure quiet, warm, room alone to acclimate to new surroundings.  Whines all night to come inside off and on. (Seems to have strong separation anxiety.)

In afternoon the next day: Timid, tail between legs, lower rear always down when looking up. Whale eyes constantly. Let outside into a new yard. SLOW walking and sniffing. Hunkered down incredibly low, head down, tip toeing and slow walking. The most timid I'd ever seen a dog. When left alone at a fair distance away, I crouched down to her level to let her know I was not a threat by being above her or near her, did not make eye contact, Baby talked, and let her explore, instead she low growled at me. I got up, kept an eye on her, walked slow and talked gently. She walked up to me, rear down. No tail wags.  She does not appear to have any pain in joints or feet, no limping, no signs of illness or symptoms of rabies or seizures/cognitive decline. Though is not eating much. (Probably due to being somewhere new and having new kibble.)

Evening: Tail wags, allows pets, does not growl when stroked on the back while eating. Seeks human touch, nudges hands. When hearing noises, she freezes and stares. Constant staring, often with eye white. Somewhat unsettling? (Maybe this is a Collie thing, since they're working dogs?) very still, very quiet when staring. Seems to ""Snap out"" of it when spoken to. Did take a nap with us around. Still highly anxious. Her ears are never perked up, they are constantly glued down to her head, not sure if this is because of her being a mixed breed. But they never ""Perk up"" at sound. She's been very sweet, tries to lick and wants to be near people.

Precautions: Dog is being kept in a secure warm room with food and water, has been given a collar and lead. Will be muzzled when outside or possibly near other creatures or people. She will not be allowed near other pets as we no longer have any. I try to give her some engagement, but keep it somewhat brief as I'm not keen on getting attached.",t2_dbulwz22,0,"My Collie Killed my smaller dog, What do I do?","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zw9yfr,True,Adventurous-Series81,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zw9yfr/my_collie_killed_my_smaller_dog_what_do_i_do/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zw9yfr/my_collie_killed_my_smaller_dog_what_do_i_do/,2475575,1672126468,0,,False,1672126488,1672126489,2022-12-27 07:34:28,,,,,,,

I've begun to think the problem is allergies as he has been licking his paws for years, it's only recently its become a serious problem. 

Please can you suggest an antihistamine i can be prescribed which could be given to my dog. 
I cannot afford a vet subscription and due to the country I'm in, the difference between a human and animal subscription is $40+. 
He is a family dog, almost farm dog. My mother and father bought him    but he adopted me and has been my puppy since.

He has very sore paws, which he's had for many months. Both of my parents have in the past had farm dogs of the same breed which have lived to 16yrs. My dad prescribed motor oil on the sensitive parts as it stopped them licking in the past, I really dint want to try that as he seems very sore. 

About 3 weeks ago he stopped getting up and looked very depressed, I took him to the vet, with my own money, fearing the worst and they said he has a paw infection. He was prescribed 7 days of antibiotics and pain relief and seemed to improve in that time, I think it was due to the pain relief stopping the discomfort. 

He was walking after a day of anti biotics, and has been walking since. His feet have began to deteriorate again, blood showing through the paws and a sensitivity to walking on stones which is the make of our driveway.

My work schedule is weird due to my profession and traveling. On the contrary I have been told I have a chaotic style and need to calm the fck down. 

Our new pup 2yr female amstaff/boxer/dalmatian mix does not think so. I take her to the dog park everyday. She could stay for five hours, boxing nine rounds and sprinting like her life depends on it. Due to practicality, I cut it off at 1.5 hours because otherwise I can‚Äôt get anything done. I will also add she spent much of her young life on the streets and is more ripped than I could ever hope to be üò©

We drive backroads with windows down so she can stick her head out (body harness engaged) and enjoy the drive. All in all, around 2-3 hours out per day. 

We have occasional play dates with dog park friends and neighborhood friends. 

She sleeps a bit, but when she wants to play she crawls all over your workspace to let you know. A walk or hike doesn‚Äôt help unless it is 5+miles. We are trying to train her to be able to run with us or run next to bike, but we are her first family so she doesn‚Äôt understand how to not dart across the path yet. 

I even found a CrossFit gym that allows dogs because she loves human interaction. We go 4 days a week. 

At home I do kongs. I do memory games. The towel knot thing with chicken or treats in it. She has a basket of toys she loves, but tires from quickly- squeakers, tennis balls, flavored ropes and balls, you name it. 

The only thing to placate her is the dog park, a strenuous hike, or boarding/daycare and heavy interaction with other dogs; which I feel bad about leaving her for. 

Normal tasks around the house are like, so totally boring to her üíÖ. I have a waist leash thing because she follows me around, so I can go outside without worry. I‚Äôm still so boring to her.

Its especially bad when we are on the boxers home turf. My dog goes to daycare regularly and gets along with everyone, whereas the boxer has only met a couple dogs and appears to be possessive at home. Both dogs are friendly and very chill when apart.

We don't know what to do because we can't hang out and enjoy ourselves. It got to the point tonight i juat grabbed my dog and left suddenly because my friend was yelling and pushing at him while favoring his dog (you can't let one on the couch and yell at the other....) and I was fed up with having to constantly monitor my dog.
So part of it is us having different opinions on training too. I'm bias, but my dog is a pup who's still learning, he's very smart and I don't want him picking up bad habits from my friend or his dog. I also don't think yelling or pushing him away is right.

609,dogs,"My dog is a rescue from a backyard breeder. She spent her whole life in a yard with only a trailer for shelter having puppies for her owners to sell for meth. The only reason I have her is because she got badly injured and was surrendered rather than her owners pay for treatment and a local rescue took her. The vet discovered that she‚Äôd had at least two litters and she was less than 2 years old. I see how it affects her, she won‚Äôt let dogs sniff her rear (she sits to shut them down which I read is how females reject males), she got lots of comments about her loose skin and big nipples (making her less likely to be adopted). She was so lucky to get out because most of these females get so overbred they can suffer from severe medical issues by the time they‚Äôre only 6. And that‚Äôs just the bitches.

Right now on another popular sub for a breed very common in shelters is someone showing off their FIVE WEEK OLD puppy. This leads to anxiety, depression, behavioral issues and yes, aggression. No real breeder sells puppies before 8 weeks. I would love to know how many dogs in shelters with behavioral issues were sold at this age.

610,dogs,"I have a 4 year old female shiba that I love, but she can be a very difficult dog. I got her at 7 months from a friend that couldn‚Äôt handle her, offered her for free to me and she was from a very reputable breeder so I jumped at the chance. But she‚Äôs very reactive and anxious, she‚Äôs gotten better with lots of training and positive reinforcement with the help of medication but still requires a lot of work. Also like a typical shiba is very stubborn and has lots of allergy issues, she takes up a huge amount of my time and honestly it has taken a toll on me. I love her though and just endured it, making adjustments to my own lifestyle to make sure I could take good care of her.

Recently, I got two more dogs. I had a friend that fosters dogs and had two that were rescued from a dog meat farm in Asia, she had to move back home for a family emergency and asked if I wanted to adopt them. My shiba had played with those dogs many times and they got along great so I said yes, and it‚Äôs been about a month and a half since I‚Äôve had them. They‚Äôre  mixes (embark said Japanese/Korean village dogs) but similar spitz breeds, however they are so much easier than my shiba‚Ä¶like they actually listen, i don‚Äôt have to wrestle them out of bed to go potty, they never get feisty when I try to love them, etc. I don‚Äôt think it would be an understatement to say that the two new dogs take up less than half the effort/time as my shiba lol.

616,dogs,"I miss my two dogs, Rusty and Sugar, so much. Rusty was 19 years old when he passed away on November 7th, 2021 at 2:37PM. Sugar was 18 years old when she passed away on December 9th, 2022 at 10:06AM. I haven‚Äôt left the house since except for yesterday when I went to the family Christmas party.

I grew up with those dogs. There is, literally, no one else that knows me better than those two dogs did. They‚Äôve been with me since junior high. They were with me when I was a broke college student, living out of shitty apartments, eating cheap Raman and they were eating Kibble from Walmart. And they were also with me when I came up and was able to finally buy us a home in a beachfront neighborhood and I could afford to buy them chewing bones from the gourmet butcher down the street. They were also with me when I got married and my husband passed away two years later. They were my ‚Äúride or die.‚Äù They followed me anywhere and everywhere. We travelled all over North America together. We trusted each other completely. The three of us were an actual pack. One for all and all for one. We had a bond and a vibe. I remember when I would be doing my homework late into the night, they would be there with me just sleeping next to me. I remember walking miles a day all over the city with them to tire them out because they were both terriers with lots of energy. I remember snow days, hot lazy summer days and fall days crunching through the leaves together while walking through the park. I remember our frolicking along the beaches, our hikes through the mountains and our walks through the forests. I remember our road trips across North America.

I found Rusty in March 2002 in New Mexico wandering the Jemez mountains. My family and I had gone to New Mexico for a vacation. My parents let me take him home. Rusty was little and fierce. According to the vet Rusty was about a year and a half and had been hunting and killing small prey for food when I found him because they found fur and feathers in his teeth. Rusty always fascinated me, because he was basically wild, and it was so cool to see him learn to be a family dog but still retain some of his bad-assery. He was so athletic and fast that I almost named him Shortstop. He ran circles around all the other dogs at the dog park. He was that dog that got all the other dogs to chase him. One time we were in Maryland, and I had Rusty off leash in a field when we ran into four deer. Rusty immediately took off and began chasing the deer. The deer took off and I didn‚Äôt stand a chance. I watched as Rusty separated two of the deer from the group and chased them into trees that lined the field. I started shouting Rusty‚Äôs name for almost a good minute when he finally emerged covered in dirt and mud and smiling and happy as shit. Turns out that a few meters beyond the trees is a chain link fence that goes around the back of another building and the deer that Rusty was chasing had jumped the fence and Rusty probably tried to jump the fence too but couldn‚Äôt clear it so he turned back around and came back to me. Rusty also had great instincts about people. People give off certain smells and Rusty always reacted very obviously and physically when he didn‚Äôt like someone‚Äôs smell or vibe. Rusty was so tough and street smart, but he was also so squishy and cuddly. For such a tough little guy he sure was a good cuddler.¬†

My parents found Sugar a year and a half later outside of a Petco in Tukwila, WA being given away in a litter by a couple whose dog had a litter that they were trying to find good homes for. Sugar was my baby girl and my princess. She loved all of my girly things like when I would put on makeup or perfume, and she hated getting dirty. When I would put my makeup on Sugar would whine softly until I brushed her with a makeup brush too. Sugar wanted what to do what I wanted to do. She was always just happy to be there. If I wanted to sleep all day she would, if it was time to play, she would play. If you needed cuddles and hugs, she would lay still and let you cuddle and squeeze her and cry into her fur if you needed to. She was so sweet and emotional and expressive. Sometimes it felt like her eyes were looking deep into my soul. Sugar loved humans. More than other dogs. She would try to get everyone to pet her and nearly everyone did. Sugar was also very smart. I could always feel her eyes on me, learning and absorbing me. ¬†Sugar had her own free spirit and she let it shine sometimes but Sugar was also obedient. She had no interest in being an alpha or being a leader. Rusty had that role, and she was fine with that. Rusty needed and thrived on adventure and excitement and new experiences. Sugar thrived on affection, kindness, gentleness and baby talk. Sugar and Rusty‚Äôs bond was so strong, and they looked out for each other. Rusty and Sugar spent their entire lives together. From the moment my parents brought Sugar home she never spent a day alone in her life. Rusty knew what it was like to be an only dog for a little while, but Sugar never knew what it was like to be or feel alone. Sugar was also a pretty gnarly American Staffordshire Terrier cross, she was physically strong and even though to me she always looked like my puppy, I knew that to others her appearance made some people think twice about approaching me and honestly, at first I was annoyed by that especially when people would actually cross the street when we approached but after I while I got used to it and even didn‚Äôt mind it because it just left us with more room on the sidewalk. I decided that it wasn‚Äôt my place to enlighten others. If they chose to be ignorant and afraid, so be it. Live and let live. Also, with my insomnia, Rusty, Sugar and I would walk around downtown Vancouver late and night and even very early morning and I think the only reason why I was able to do so safely and never got messed with is because I was walking around with two dogs, one of which was a big ol‚Äô american staffie. Sugar was the best ambassador for her breed, she never had any issues with any other dogs, any other animals or people. She was sweet, gentle, funny, smart, sensitive, brave, athletic and well trained. I could bring both of my dogs into businesses and stores that allowed it. My nieces and nephews jumped all over Sugar, played fetch with her, tugged on her tail and ears and she would just lay there and let it happen. Sugar loved kids so much.¬†

I went to a university close to home, so I didn‚Äôt have to leave them and when I got my first apartment, they came with me. I promised Rusty and Sugar a house with a yard, but I couldn‚Äôt come through on that promise. Housing is expensive in British Columbia so all I could swing was a really nice condo.¬†

It‚Äôs hard being without them during the holidays. When I lost Rusty last year it hurt so bad, but I had Sugar left to still care for and Rusty wouldn‚Äôt have wanted us to grieve for him for too long, he was the kind of dog that was already to move forward and keep going. Losing Sugar was different because it meant that it was truly the end of an almost 20-year bond. The grief was so heavy and painful that I thought it would surely kill me. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and some days the grief was so bad that my body just kept wanting to shut down and all I could think about was getting to the end of the day so I could crawl back in bed and cry. It still hurts and I know it will hurt forever. It‚Äôs the kind of hurt that‚Äôs bittersweet and stays with you forever.

For almost 20 years it was just me and my dogs and now it‚Äôs just me. I know I will love another dog again but the life of the next dog that chooses me is going to be so different from the life that Rusty and Sugar had. Never forget the ones that loved you when you were and had nothing.

It feels really weird to not have a dog. No tippy taps on the floor, no dogs trying to get close to you, trying to get you to pet them, no dogs to bark at nothing, no dogs to greet you when you get home from work. Food is just food now. I would get excited about food because I knew that they would get excited. Going for walks is just a walk, no dogs pulling on me and to go faster and then abruptly stopping at every tree, post, pole or bush that got their attention. Every Christmas, weather permitting, we‚Äôd go on our Christmas Walk.¬†

I‚Äôve seen the costs of having a dog skyrocket. As a renter for many years before buying my first home, I saw the renters market become more discriminatory towards renters with pets. I‚Äôve seen the role of the family dog change and now dogs are expected to be children and personal therapists. Being the owner of a bully breed dog, I also lived in constant concern that the harmful and discriminatory breed ban legislations I saw in other countries, states and provinces (we lived in both Canada and the US) would make its way to where we lived. I‚Äôve learned a lot from having dogs, not just about dogs but also about myself. All of the worry, concern and politics surrounding dog ownership is nothing compared to the joy, loyalty, happiness and companionship they bring to your life. Every single second was worth it. Although I miss my dogs so much, I also know I know did good. They both lived a long and fulfilling life full of love, affection, security, stability, fun, travel and adventure. In their old age they lived in loving peace and quiet and they had soft warm beds and spaces to lay and sleep on to comfort their old bones. Our 3-4 hour walks became short 20-60 minute walks through the park when they got too old for adventures. I was always the first thing they saw in the morning and I was the last face they saw before they crossed over. Love your dogs and show them the best life you can because time flies and goodbye comes sooner than you think.¬†

Now I'm not a dog ""expert"" but here are few things I've picked up (some the hard way) about being a dog owner that I hope some find helpful:

\-Try to let your praise be their reward, not treats.

\-Pet Insurance. Pet Insurance. Pet Insurance.

\-Respect the Breed: What the heck are you doing with an Alaskan Malamute in LA? Why are you using a retractable leash on a Rottie?

\-Know your limits and budgets: Big dogs need more food and space and their grooming, vet and even end of life costs will almost always be higher.

\-Certain breed dogs are not for first time/inexperienced dog owners. American Staffies are big, strong, powerful, fast, intelligent, sensitive and loyal. They will test you to see if you are worthy, most of you won't be. You cannot ""control"" these dogs like you could a small one, if a small one doesn't do what you want you can just pick up and place it where you like. With a large breed dog, they must be trained and if you're not smart or patient enough to do it then stick with the little dogs.

\-Do your research before taking on a dog.

\-Dogs are not children and should not be treated like children

\-Unless trained, your dog is not your emotional support. Please get professional help and let your dog be a dog.

\-There will always be that one toy or item that your dog will never destroy.

\-Not walking your dog and allowing it the opportunity to be social every day/as much as possible is actually dog abuse

\-Get trained in dog first aid

\-When you're petting your dogs also take the opportunity to feel for any spots or lumps. Especially when they get older.

\-Have a regular vet if you can. I didn't always have an appointment, but Rusty and Sugar had a regular vet that I could just call for some quick advice. For example, one time Sugar ate the red wax that comes wrapped around those little Babybel cheeses and I just called up their vet really quick to see if there was anything to worry about.

\-Dogs may not (always) need to wear clothes but darn it they look cute, and it makes people smile.

\-Pick up after your dog's poop. ALWAYS.

\-Train your dogs to not go on people's lawns, only on the sidewalks and boulevards.

\-Don't let your dogs pee on businesses sandwich board signs, those signs cost money.

\-Keep your dogs indoors or give your dog a doghouse outside that's equally as nice and secure as yours.

\-IMO dogs should be allowed on the furniture. If not, please make sure there are plenty of soft spaces around the home for them to lay in and make some of those soft spaces near you because your dog always wants to be close to you.

\-Since I had both a smallish/medium sized dog and a big one, I always bought a big size toy and a smaller size toy. Save yourself some money and just buy one size. Rusty, my little dog, always played with Sugar's big sized toys and Sugar played with Rusty's smaller sized toys anyway. 

\-Dogs and most other animals are used for our pleasure and purposes, therefore they deserve the utmost respect and reverence.

\-Your dog will always want to be where you are, get used it.

\-Properly training and disciplining your dog is one of the top ways to show you love your dog.

\-Keep your dog away from dog runs and other gated off areas that allow dogs to be off-leash. These places are the perfect setting for fights and scuffles to break out, between both dogs and owners.

\-Keep your dogs leashed. Keep your dogs leashed. Keep your dogs leashed.

\-Dogs need what humans need: Food, shelter, (sometimes clothing), love, affection, stimulation, purpose, security and stability.

\-A dog will only break your heart once.",t2_q7gtqq22,0,"This Christmas was my first one without a dog and 2023 will be my first time entering the new year without a dog.

622,dogs,"I set an appointment in Oct and I didn't go to it bc my dog was feeling better. Lost track of time and called 20 min after the appt time. Lady said that it was a no-show and that I would have to pay a 35 deposit of the next visit. ok.. 

Then Dec 9th my dog chipped his tooth. And I called to ask a question about seeing a vet, if I needed to get a referral or see a doggy dentist. They were said you can set an appt and see, but the pulp of his tooth was showing and I wanted to get him to see a dentist immediately to prevent infection. (For other dog owners out there, if you want to do cleaning or extraction you don't need a referral, but for a specialty dentist for crowns and root canals you do.) Again she tells me about the 35 deposit, but I didn't set an appt. 

I eventually find the only dog dentist that does root canals and crowns, and since he needs a referral, set the earliest vet appt Dec 23. The girl took my appt and said nothing else, the deposit didn't even cross my mind. 

At the end of the appt they charged me 35 on top of my bill. And I called to ask why they did that. The receptionist got loud with me and said it was for a no show and that you pay for not showing up. and she used the word deposit and fee interchangeably.  I told her that's not what I was told over the phone (twice) and that if I were to put down a 35 deposit it would be absorbed into the bill not on top of the bill. She ~~says~~  yells I didn't show up in Oct. Yes, but was told that it was deposit. So she backtracks and says its a new policy to charge the 35 and there's no deposit unless I was repeat offender. 

So I asked WHEN this new policy was instated. ""last week"" - between my Dec 9th phone call and this Dec 23 appt. Then she got louder when I asked her why I was charged for a policy change for something that happened in October. And she said her manger would give me a call (which has not happened) 

She made me feel crazy about asking for this and saying that it shouldn't be charged. I have pretty bad anxiety and I can't tell if am I nuts for trying to get my money back or am I just being manipulated? 

35 might not be a lot to some, but I'm looking at X-rays, anesthesia, root canal and crown moldings for him in the near future.

He said he might say ""hey whoa thats bad"" if he thought the dog was being beat to death and only then would he step in. He said he didn't know the abuser or others who hit dogs well enough to say anything. I asked if he thought the same about children and he said no he'd call CPS and he'd step in with me but if it was an animal he would never step in or say something.

So a few days ago our 4 almost 5 month old GSD discovered shadows. I think he had discovered it from my brother who had brought home a measuring device that uses a laser and had played with him for a minutes after noticing that he took interest in it. I told him to not do that again after I noticed he was still looking for the dot for a good while after it was gone. Now he seems to be fixated on the shadows in the house. More specifically our shadows under our feet. He mostly just sits there and stairs but has tried going after them a few times.. we‚Äôve been keeping him distracted by training and playing but once we‚Äôre done he goes back to staring.

645,dogs,"So this has only happened twice, but the fact that it happened ever means we cannot leave my 42 lb 1 y.o. lab mix with my dad's 18 lb mini pincsher alone. It sucks. She has to be crated when we arent home anyway because she is new and destructive and will eat non-food items. Wondering if she will grow out of it as she learns how to play? She was in the shelter for months and an unclaimed stray before that and due to how rough she played at first with the small dog this is the first time learning bite inhibition I think? I read that means she must have been taken from her mom and litter way too early. 

She hasn't had a prey drive towards even smaller dogs (weenies) that she met this weekend just by looking at them, but maybe it was because she was nervous in the new environment and she barely paid attention to the dogs at all anyway other than some sniffing. And then we had her crated away from the chaos of the family party so she wouldnt be overwhelmed, so we didnt get to see them interact much.

So what happened the first time was my lab grabbed the mini's collar and thrashed her head twice, a couple days after being home before she started really learning to play gentle. They usually play gentle now except when my lab gets too out of control with excitement and starts bouncing off all the couches and ignoring cues from the other dog, that's when we break them up. The second time was today, she grabbed the smaller dog's leg and shook when play started to escalate. We put her in timeout for a few minutes immediately. It was the smaller dog's bad leg too (she has this thing where her right knee pops out of place sometimes), but she didnt seem hurt and she didnt even yelp during that quick thrash.

Do you think this will get worse? I dont know how else to train other than being firm with my ""no"" and redirecting her attention or grabbing her if I can't get her attention. After timeout today I took her outside and ran with her and got her to sprint around and sniff things and played a little fetch although she got bored of chasing the ball after 2 throws. After some time she refused to play more and just wanted to go back inside probably because she was getting cold. When she got back inside she almost immediately started playing too rough again and we had to get her to settle in her crate.

For redirecting I started using a squeak toy to redirect, but I cant give it to her because its tiny and the other squeak toy that she can have is a different pitch and she doesn't g.a.f about it.There will be times in the future the lab will have to go to doggy daycare and i dont want her to hurt a smaller dog. I'm also worried play will escalate into aggression/prey drive faster and faster if she thinks she has been ""getting away with it"" if what I've been doing hasnt been enough. Watching them play at all is so stressful and they want to do it a lot, but it's giving me gray hairs having to watch their every move constantly because of the size difference. I haven't been able to do anything I love like play video games or even talk to my best friend because all my free time when I'm not watching these two, training, walking, playing with them, etc. is spent googling stuff about dog behavior and training and everything under the sun. There's so much contradicting stuff out there too which is confusing as hell.

651,dogs,"It was as if he did it on purpose to avenge himself sometimes, even though logically I don't think that's the case.

First-off, he's been toilet trained. Yes, he also grows up in my room till he gets a bit older to unlock the other huge area in the house. On many occasions, he will pee and poo in the toilet by opening the toilet door himself (yes, he knows), and even outside the house. And since young, he's been praised and rewarded whenever he did it right.

It's all been okay.

But when he gets around 8 to 10 months old, he has his humping stage (I'm not sure if that's even related but I would point that out too). Also more importantly, he started peeing onto my bed. Why I would say sometimes it felt as if he did it on purpose is because it always happens when he's left in the room for literally just 5 minutes. My mattress had been ambushed-peed several times and it's a very tall, thick mattress too, therefore he literally just hopped up 4 feet high just to pee on the mattress when the toilet is just a few dog-steps away??

 Is it because of separation anxiety? I sometimes thought so too, but there are also many occasions where he just doesn't leave the room with me, despite being called or invited a few times.

It was terrible sometimes I just went downstairs to see my partner off in the early morning, to come upstairs and my poodle is at the floor, nothing seems wrong, till later I found out there's a HUGE wet patch on my bed. It's been getting worse these days as he did it almost everyday. 

I tried cleaning the mattress, replacing the bedsheet, but it seems as though he would do it again once he found out there's no longer his trace on the bed. In fact, my mother changed the bedsheet yesterday and he did it again this morning.

652,dogs,"Hi guys, so basically i‚Äôve always been extremely anxious around dogs, to the point where i‚Äôll avoid them as much as i can. I know this fear has come from my family‚Äôs attitude around dogs, and when i was kid my dad would always tell me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go near random dogs they will bite you‚Äù. I know he only did this to protect me and obviously we know that‚Äôs not true, but the fear is now for ALL dogs not just ones i don‚Äôt know. Ive also been bitten by two different dogs as a kid so the fear was cemented even more. I‚Äôve managed to avoid dogs pretty well the majority of my life, and have been okay with some dogs (usually smaller dogs that are very calm and don‚Äôt bark much). 
But anyway the main problem with this fear at the moment is my partners family have 2 giant schnauzers. They‚Äôre fricking huge and are very territorial. (they‚Äôre very friendly once they‚Äôve chilled out but anyone with a fear of dogs knows this rationality doesn‚Äôt make me feel much better) I love his family but the dogs scare me so much i‚Äôll avoid going to their house when possible. I‚Äôm heading up to theirs tomorrow to stay for a week and the thought of the dogs is making me feel physically sick, when i‚Äôm there i can‚Äôt physically relax and don‚Äôt even feel able to walk around the house alone. 
The whole point of this post is to ask for some advice on how to start getting over this fear (especially when i first enter their house and the dogs are barking and jumping up at me, as i freeze up and am on the verge of tears). 
Any advice would be appreciated as i‚Äôm so embarrassed of this whole thing. ‚ù§Ô∏è

note: My partner and his parents are aware i‚Äôm scared of the dogs, but i don‚Äôt think they know to what extent. they do try to help but it doesn‚Äôt make much difference (even thought i really appreciate it).",t2_819fecr5,0,i‚Äôm fed up of my fear of dogs,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zvzt1o,True,Delicious-Nose-8069,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zvzt1o/im_fed_up_of_my_fear_of_dogs/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zvzt1o/im_fed_up_of_my_fear_of_dogs/,2475455,1672096232,0,,False,1672096245,1672096246,2022-12-26 23:10:32,,,,,,,

Where I live is very normal for dogs to be exclusively outside dogs but lately i've been seeing a lot of comments that this is dog abuse or something.

My dog eventually gets sick of us and wants to go outside on his own.

They have two very different lot numbers and different looking stamps as well as phrasing the expiration date differently (m/d/y vs m/y) which makes me unsure if it came from the same manufacturing plant.  They were produced 2 months apart.

Here‚Äôs some other breeds we think he could possibly be mixed with:

Coonhound (s)
Foxhound(s)
Boxer
Rhodesian Ridgeback

662,dogs,"Growing up me and my partner both owned dogs which stayed outside at night. In my case they stayed in a heated barn and his dogs stayed in an enclosed, covered area with a dog house. Our country doesn‚Äôt see extreme temperatures or weather. During the day they came inside but were never allowed in the kitchen/bedrooms. They only came indoors when we were in the home. I‚Äôm not sure what the reasoning for this was, it was just seen as the done thing. My family would see it as highly unusual to have a large dog indoors at all times.

We are thinking of getting a Doberman and are planning on setting up a heated outhouse to continue this arrangement. It would have an interior that was comfortable for the dog and he would have full access to a large, enclosed backyard. This would be used when we both were out of the house and at night time. 

Our reasoning for this was:
1. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre used to.
2. Keeps our elderly cat safe indoors when he‚Äôs unsupervised.
3. No ‚Äòaccidents‚Äô in the house. The dog will be able to use the bathroom whenever he needs. 
4. The dog can‚Äôt become destructive indoors and damage the house.
5. The dog won‚Äôt have access to anything potentially dangerous indoors.

We told our friends about this arrangement and they all disagreed, it seems like they think it‚Äôs cruel? I was confused as I personally think it‚Äôs a better arrangement than using a crate. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Or personal opinions?

i'm not sure why that noise in particular affects her though. she used to belong to my grandma who passed away a couple years ago but she was very little at the time and my grandma was as sweet as candy so hopefully it doesnt have to do with trauma but the dog does have anxiety so maybe it's that? i know reddit isnt the most reliable source of information out there but google wasn't helping and i think it'd be better to talk to actual people to figure out what's up with this, i dont think its that much of an issue i'm just curious

668,dogs,"To start, ive done a crazy amount of research over the past year or two and im still trying to find a good breed.

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

no. i have owned two dogs, one past away last summer. i volunteer every weekend at my local humane society and help care for and train the dogs. i also have a foster right now.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

definitely not super high energy. i love being pretty chill but i‚Äôll run every once in awhile and im starting to more but i don‚Äôt like to alone. they have to be low shed and relatively hypoallergenic, my mom is allergic but she‚Äôs fine with our chihuahua. so, im looking for dogs that aren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúhypoallergenic‚Äù but still low allergen.

also, very biddable and eager to please. they‚Äôll be trained for service work.

somewhere around 2 feet tall, but this can be negotiated.

also, looking for a very cute dog. i know this is different for each person, but you get the gist. like i don‚Äôt prefer the bed beddlington terrier.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

english sheepdog and bernese mountain dogs. i like big fluffy dogs but can‚Äôt have one because it has to be low shed so disregard this.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

they will be high trained. we will do lots of early socializing and desensitization. they will be trained to be an SD (multipurpose, mostly psych) so they need to b biddable. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

no probably not. again just service work

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

all day every day this summer then about every day after work/school. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

i can‚Äôt have a very high energy dog because i can probably only commit an hour tops during school/ work days. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

not poodle level of grooming but weekly/monthly brushing is okay. i will definitely be doing nail trimming and teeth brushing and i can pay for grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

medium, about 2ft tall

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

very low shed, im allergic fro dog saliva lol so not too much slobber. i‚Äôll be training them not to bark.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

not a super huge deal but i‚Äôll be training recall. id definitely like to be able to do this.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

definitely not a dog that can‚Äôt be left alone at all like cocker spaniels. but i‚Äôd like one that still wants to be around me majority of the time.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

eager to pleas

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

i‚Äôll hopefully be training them to go to their crate or lay on a placemat at the sound of a door knock or bell. they need to keep all focus on me when seeing new people unless i allow them to greet and they will do so friendly.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

no not really because they will hopefully be a service dog if all goes well.

670,dogs,"My dog is 15 or 16. We aren't sure exactly because she was a rescue and they were only able to give us an estimate of her age. She's gone through a lot in her long life. She had a ruptured spleen many years ago and broke one of her back legs about 2 or 3 years ago. She's been experiencing some mobility issues, which we believe is arthritis and we were planning to visit the vet soon to get their opinion and some medication if necessary. I know the broken leg, although it healed extremely well, likely doesn't help. 

She mostly uses puppy pads to potty now. There are a lot of reasons for this, but essentially it's just easier for her and us. She still gets plenty of time outside, especially when the weather is nice. I think her favorite weather is low 70s with a breeze lol. But she's started pottying in random areas of the house. I thought it may be because she can't see, but she's been dealing with that for a long time now and this has never been an issue before. I feel like maybe it's an issue with her brain/memory. 

And, like I said, she's likely completely blind now. She moves around pretty well, given her age and the issues she has, but she does spend most of her time sleeping. We started adding stuff to her food in the morning (they always get wet food with dinner) because we noticed she wasn't eating as much, and that worked for a while, but now she's back to barely eating again. She would still devour a bag of treats if you let her though (I don't lol). Her mobility has gotten a lot better since we started giving her these hemp chews. She still has issues, but she was running around the other day and I can't remember the last time she did that. 

Mostly I look at her and I just get the feeling that she's ready. Part of me wants to get medication from the vet and see if that helps, but I know that it won't help forever. And I don't know if it would be fair to her. She's so old, she's been through so much, and I don't want to keep her alive for my own sake. I also don't want to wait until it gets really bad and we lose her without actually getting to say goodbye. 

Like I said in the title, I think I just need advice and support. If you have a question or need info, feel free to ask. I personally think it may be time to say goodbye, but I want to know if other people feel the same way (or if you don't, that's fine too). If it's her time, I'm okay with that. I've had many years with her and she deserves to go with dignity. I guess I just need someone to tell me that it's the right thing to do and I wouldn't be making a mistake. 

I believe I have photos of her in my profile if anyone is curious, she's the adorable, scruffy tan and black one :)",t2_3nijh9fd,0,[TW: Pet Loss] It might be time to say goodbye.

I currently live in a house, with a yard. However, my relationship is ending, so I‚Äôll be going back to renting so I can get my own place- which will more than likely be an apartment. I have a 7YO Blue Heeler. My boyfriend and I are working on an arrangement where we switch off with him. While it‚Äôs a heartbreaking split, we are ending on extremely good terms, so we won‚Äôt have any problems there. 

I‚Äôve never lived alone and don‚Äôt want to be without a companion during the weeks that I don‚Äôt have my dog. I‚Äôve actually wanted a second dog for almost a year now, so I guess the timing is finally right. My dog is amazing with other dogs, so he‚Äôll likely be fine. 

My concern is that I do NOT want a small dog. I‚Äôm trying to find a bigger breed that will do okay in an apartment. I am a pretty active person- I go to the gym and walk my dog a few times a day, plus try to do a longer walk or fun hike every weekend. So, I have the energy to make sure a bigger apartment dog gets the exercise they need. I just don‚Äôt know if I want something OVERLY high strung like an Australian Shepherd or a Husky. (My Heeler has a very chill temperament for a cattle dog. He‚Äôs always ready to play, but loves to relax too.)

I‚Äôve looked into these breeds a lot over the years: Bernese Mountain Dogs, Newfoundlands, Great Pyrenees, Rottweilers, Pits, Danes, Akitas, Dalmatians, and a few others I‚Äôm sure.

687,dogs,"Hi, so, I have a dog, who seems to be the softest idiot I know. When we're out on walks he always likes attention from people and will cuddle into them if I'm waiting in a queue and a stranger talks to him, (usually, I try to ignore these interactions, mainly because I'm socially inept, sometimes because I'm trying to get him to focus on me, and people are strange and think its okay to come and pet him just because he looked at them) he seems confident and although he's a lab and can still have his moments, he's pretty compliant. 

The problem I seem to have, and this is a rough estimate every 1 in every 200 dogs we come across he has a little beef them. A little snarling, I've witnessed every one and  genuinely don't think he's provoking the aggression, but maybe I can't read the body language that well. He's never bitten and in each one I've been able to control him and move him away.

691,dogs,"Hello,
I've found myself in a pickle. 
I intentionally had 2 dogs, then in 2019 I found the cutest ~8 month old puppy, let's call her Risky, on the side of the road chasing cars. At the time, I lived with my partner of 2.5 years who was a dog whisperer and had lost his dog almost 2 years prior. We had experienced 3 dogs before &amp; we had a fenced in backyard. My original 2 dogs aren't really friends but do fine together, just keep their distance. Risky comes along J is best buddies w one of my original 2. I keep her. 
Fast forward to now, I'm no longer with the dog whisperer and have lived alone in an apartment with no backyard for over a year.
3 dogs is too much. Too much financially, too much time, too much stress. I feel like it is holding me back. I have had a dog since my junior year in high school. I am 30 now. I want to adventure freely without something at home or having to pay so much for dog care. I feel obligated because I agreed to this responsibility, she's lived with us pretty much her whole life so I feel that she and her best bud/my other dog would grieve each other. At the same time, she's only 3. I can't do it another 12+ years. 
I don't know. My priorities, focus, and situation in life has changed. I would feel immense guilt for rehoming her. I have this conflict between an extreme sense of loyalty &amp; what I think is best for me.

Any advice or experience?

695,dogs,"Hello, dog parents! I 'm seeking advice for 3 stray dogs we recently took in‚Äîjust take a look at these angels here: [https://imgur.com/a/gZRK4hK](https://imgur.com/a/gZRK4hK)  

**Background/context:** My husband was deer hunting in a nearby forest early Christmas Eve morning when he stumbled upon three skinny, starving shivering dogs (we've been dealing with uncharacteristically cold weather/freeze warnings for the last couple weeks where we live in Texas, so these dogs were likely on the brink of death‚Äîa local passerby told my husband he's seen them in the forest for going on 2 months now). We think are around \~7ish months old.  

After some convincing, my husband was able to round all three of them up and bring them to our home. We fed and watered them, set up a large cozy kennel and a space heater in our garage, and got them all settled. Since it's so cold, last night we brought them inside‚Äîwe have a closed off laundry room where we made a pallet for them. This morning, we bathed all three (Lord they stunk).

We think they're Catahoula dogs, and it's kind of insane how docile, friendly and obedient they are. They've shown 0 aggression and respond positively to anything we do/say, they love all the head scratches and lovin' we give them, and they even listen to us when we call them, which is so shocking. They seem to love us ü•π

All that being said, I'm seeking advice on how to best continue to care for them while we find them a loving home. We definitely can't keep all three (which tears me up a bit because I don't want them to be separated, they all look out for each other, highly possible they're brothers) and while we are considering keeping one, it's not set in stone (candidly, I've never had a dog or desired to have a dog, I didn't have pets growing up so I'm just not much of a dog gal as far as actually owning them)‚ÄîI'll need to think long and hard about everything dog ownership entails, the cost, the time commitment, and if it would be feasible for us. But that's a whole other post in itself (though feel free to weigh in with any helpful perspectives for a decision like this, if you have them).  

My main question is what is the best way to handle this situation and care for these dogs in the meantime? (we're trying to avoid taking them to the shelter if possible, and we want to try and find them loving homes ourselves before going that route). **A few top of mind questions:** 

* What's the process for taking them to the vet? Are there any low cost options for this type of thing? If I took them to my vet (I own a cat), I'm sure it would be $1,000+ to have them all checked up, given shots, etc., and we can't afford that. How should I proceed? 
* Is it okay for us to continue caring for them until we find them a home? It kind of sucks because it's clear they love and trust us and we're all getting attached...but what else are we supposed to do?! 
* How should we handle their raw, bleeding paws (it may be frostbite, but definitely a result of them being in the freezing forest for months)? I have no idea how to care for that but you can tell it hurts when they walk, and they've been bleeding a lot. 
* Should we take them on walks? I guess we'd have to buy leashes?
* Any and all other tips you may have for this scenario are welcome. As someone who's never owned dogs, I just want to make sure we're doing this as well as possible.

701,dogs,"Hi dog parents! I am looking for advice on the best way to communicate with loving dog parents, like yourself, about my severe dog allergy.

**My Allergy:** I am severely allergic to dogs. Dog dander (which is airborne and microscopic like smoke), triggers a severe asthmatic reaction. I have to go to the ER immediately for cortisone shots, and then take steroids for ten days to keep my lungs open. It is a severely isolating and lonely disease, because I simply cannot be in the same place where a dog is or has been present.

**The Problem:**

My fianc√©'s family has a wonderful vacation home where they spend holidays. This Christmas, I went over as usual to celebrate (I should add that I do not have my own family for reasons I don't want to get into here). So, it means a lot to me to be able to spend time with the family.

My fianc√©'s sister flew in from across the country to spend the holidays with us. She brought her new dog with her, without telling us in advance. We were surprised to learn that she registered the dog as a ""service animal"" so that it can fly with her (she admits this was a fake registration). 

His family is aware of my allergy. However, his sister is deeply attached to her dog, and told me she considers it an equal member of the family, and I need to ""compromise"" with the dog as they will continue to be present at family gatherings. 

I started to react to the dog, and made the decision to leave, as I didn't want to end up in the ER. I told my fianc√© that he should stay, as I didn't want him to miss out on the holidays with his family. 

**How do I communicate to her about my allergy?** I think part of this is that she really loves her dog which is totally understandable, and I'm hoping to get some advice from other dog lovers about how I can best communicate with her.",t2_q9i9j3zq,0,How to communicate a severe dog allergy to a dog owner?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zvq6bj,True,neeed2ventt,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zvq6bj/how_to_communicate_a_severe_dog_allergy_to_a_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zvq6bj/how_to_communicate_a_severe_dog_allergy_to_a_dog/,2475363,1672070585,0,,False,1672070599,1672070599,2022-12-26 16:03:05,,,,,,,
702,dogs,"My wife and I recently (May 2022) adopted a rescue pomchi mutt (best guess at breed). We don't know anything about her history. She's a little less than 4 years old, was found wandering NYC around 5th Ave with another, larger dog (they did not seem to care for each other and so were adopted out separately). She's the right age to have been a covid puppy, which might be why no one went looking for her. 

Anyway! She's super affectionate and loves pets and attention, snuggles me to death and is my second shadow. The problem is that she has a very mean sounding bark. She snarls and lunges at the door even when we open it from the inside where she can see us. 

Thing is, she doesn't bite or snap just bark-snarls and the second someone reaches down she flops over and is happy as can be with the petting she gets. 

And then there's other dogs. She'll bark at any of them but is all talk once they're close together. She doesn't shy away from growling when one comes sniffing when she doesn't want them too. But she will also just decide to walk up to a dog she's been sharing a room/house with for days with no issue and scream at them unprovoked. She won't share toys or food/water.

Fast forward, 3 weeks ago we added Greta to our pack. She is a 1.5 year old German Shepard/Lab mix. Her previously living situation wasn‚Äôt great and she has anxiety over food. I do feed the dogs separately.

Yesterday for Xmas I gave them each a giant bone. Jack destroyed his and then wanted Greta‚Äôs. The fight broke out and they both stopped immediately when I pulled them apart and took the bone away.

Jack has been properly trained. Greta is set to starting training classes on January 13th.

Between now and then what precautions can I take? Is there any behaviors I need to look out for?

I‚Äôm a 24 y/o student from Sweden who just adopted a rescue from Russia. She is quite lovely as a whole but her biggest issue is separation anxiety. A problem that sadly had a pretty ugly consequence during Christmas, a relative of mine got bitten. 
I decided to go to the toilet after a walk and left her outside (in the house) and for some reason my not so sober uncle thought that it would be an excellent idea to ‚Äúroughhouse‚Äù with her, I wasn‚Äôt there obviously but according to others he pulled her tail and she warned him - he didn‚Äôt listen and so she bit him. 

After this incident I feel like I‚Äôve gotten so many different opinions, everything from it was his fault don‚Äôt worry to straight up just euthanise her. 
Personally I feel that she only defended herself but after it happened I‚Äôve definitely seen some aggression towards men on my walks with her, a completely new behaviour from what I‚Äôve seen before. 

I feel almost like I‚Äôm being torn between my family and a dog I‚Äôve had for barely a month, I‚Äôm still in my trial period and could decide to get my money back and host her here until a new family is found for her, but I like basically everything else about her and she‚Äôs made such progress this short time.

Today Christmas Day when we went on our morning and afternoon walks, she was okay. But she kept walking like she was going somewhere.

We went out for a walk, but when we‚Äôre outside, she‚Äôs acting really confused like we‚Äôre walking in one direction she suddenly stops turns around and walks in the other direction for a few feet stops. Turns around and walks in the direction we just came from stops turns around and she keeps doing this over and over or we will cross the street. We will walk in one direction for a few feet. She stops turns around and goes back to exactly where we cross the street and cross again.

733,dogs,"Yesterday, I was out for a walk with my dog when we stumbled upon a group of people and their dogs. My dog, who is usually very friendly, suddenly   became very scared and started barking. I tried to calm him down, but he was too worked up. I noticed that one of the other dogs was barking too, and it wasn't until I got closer that I realized it was an old friend of mine. We exchanged pleasantries, and I asked what he was doing in the area. He explained that he was out with a group of friends, and they had all brought their dogs along.   

I offered to let my dog meet his, and he happily agreed. We kept our dogs on opposite sides of the field, and I slowly led my dog closer to his. As we got closer, my dog started to become more relaxed and eventually the two were happily sniffing each other. I was relieved that I was able to get my dog to calm down and make a new friend.   

It was a strange and unexpected encounter, but I was glad that I was able to calm my dog down and befriend someone new. We chatted for a little bit longer and then went on our separate ways.

735,dogs,"Me, my mom, our 2 cats, and dog moved to an apartment. It was ok at first, but since 3 months have passed, our dog has developed a really bad ear infection and skin infection, and I think it might be contributing to indoor potty issues as well (she's usually well trained). Until we recently moved, our dog was potty trained well and pooped around 4-5 times a day. Now she poops more around 8 times a day when we feed her 2 cups of food per day. (she's 80 pounds and old. She gets around 15 minutes of exercise everyday) We've had her for the past six years, and her allergies have never been this bad until recently when we moved. We have taken her to the vet several times in the past to see what the issue is and how we can fix it under the guise that it was related to food issues, but now I fear that it's the cats to blame (and possible anxiety issues). All of my pets are either geriatric or old. My eldest cat is 20 years old and still kicking around, the other cat is 12, and my German shepherd/Labrador mix is 8 years old. Because my pets are elderly, we don't allow them upstairs on the carpet so that they don't have the possibility to poop or pee up there, especially the 20 year old. Now that we have a small place, our dog doesn't have the ability to space out from the cats any more than 8 feet, and we don't have a yard for her, so it's impossible to separate the cats and dog. The medication and vet appointments are getting expensive, and we only have $100-150 dollars to spend after paying bills each month without dog medication and vet appointments taken into account.

747,dogs,"I recently acquired a dog after my mother drowned over the summer. The dog was in the boat with her, and she was probably his third or fourth owner. It‚Äôs even more chaotic. My sister actually met the dog when she was working at a dog shelter during her prison stay. During that time, two different people adopted the dog and brought him back because of excessive humping. The shelter had him fixed, and when she got approved for early parole kick out, she begged for us to go get the dog. So we did. And within a couple of months, she went back to prison for the third time on a long stay. I know nothing about the two people who adopted him initially and brought him back or the original person who brought him to the shelter, but I know that my mom did not let him come in the house, despite him being some sort of pit mix with very short hair. He did have a somewhat enclosed porch full of blankets, and she did put him next to the wall that had the woodstove in it. He seemed pretty happy, but he is very skittish. When she died suddenly, I ended up with the dog. In the summer, I could give him a bath outside, but I cannot do that in the winter. The last few days have been the coldest we have had since I have on him, so I put him in the utility room. I set an alarm for six hours and make sure to take him out for a bathroom break, but he acts like he may have possibly lived in the house at some point in time. He doesn‚Äôt get into stuff and goes to the door when he needs to use the bathroom.

Back to the point: we acquired a doghouse for him that is shaped like an igloo. After working for several days, we got him to go inside. However, he destroys any bedding we put in it. We finally switched to cedar chips, but that‚Äôs because a week ago he suddenly acted completely terrified to even go near his house after spending Most of the last year in the house after he got over his initial scare. The culprit was a tiny ant mound, and we read that these chips were also a deterrent for bugs. As soon as we made the swap, he immediately slipped and they‚Äôre fine for the next few days. We also bought a heater, but he would not go in there with the heater at all. It‚Äôs not a space heater; it‚Äôs one specifically made for dog houses. We Had an abnormally intense cold-weather pattern come over us over the past week, and when it was initially moving in, we did leave him outside for a bit because we weren‚Äôt sure how he would do spending the night in the house and we wanted to see if he would go into his. With the wind, he did go inside the house and actually swept out there contently for about two hours. However, because we knew the cold would become dangerously problematic, we still elected to bring him into the house. I feel it was the right decision, but today he stayed outside all day because the weather was much better. Tonight it will be cold, but it‚Äôs nothing like the cold we‚Äôve had for the past couple of days. And he is suddenly terrified of his house again.

We have tried creating positive associations for him, such as giving him treats when he goes inside and leaving treats in the entryway. He grabs the tree and runs away. We have tried gradually throwing the tree further into the house, which he will grab the tree and run out again. We have tried putting him in there and petting him while he is standing inside of there and giving him praise. We have tried tough love by leaving him out there a little longer than he should be comfortable while we monitor him through the window where he couldn‚Äôt see us. I get too nervous I would have to bring him in, but he doesn‚Äôt want to be in the house either. He likes coming in for a visit, but then he runs back outside and won‚Äôt let me catch him if he thinks I‚Äôm going to put him in the house. 



Tl; dr: a dog I recently acquired has an aversion to his house outside but doesn‚Äôt enjoy staying inside my house either and randomly becomes terrified of his house and winter is just getting started. Any advice for getting him to get into his house that is now heated and comfortable. We have tried giving him small treats to lead him into the house, but he runs in to grab them and immediately runs out.

We fostered her to adoption almost a year ago and have worked tirelessly on training and obedience. She was found as a stray, so we don't know her exact age, but she looks and acts pretty young. Right now, she is behaving as though she is no longer house broken and had several solid (4) and liquid (2) accidents inside my In-Law's house. She is on antibiotics, drove a long distance, and was introduced to a new place and dog (another female lab who she desperately wants to be friends with); So, I understand her ""incontinence"" at the moment is likely stress related... My In-Laws are handling it graciously, but I am both stressed out and really embarrassed by her behavior. We have been bringing her outside to relieve her every hour and to play/walk as much as possible despite the very cold weather. Other than going on very long walk tomorrow morning, I am unsure how to help her settle in before we leave. I am mostly venting, but any advice is sincerely appreciated!

I want to start this by saying that my boyfriend rescued him from his previous owners. They were extremely mean to him and should be locked up, but we are both fairly new to having pets. Especially me. I've never really had any. The dog is probably around 4 or 5 and my boyfriend has had him about a year. Before we moved in together, he would potty outside and let my boyfriend know when he had to go. Now he pees on everything in our new home. (He is fixed) We have been trying to train him to go outside but we don't know what we are doing. I've looked up tips.. the main issue though is the obsession with my boyfriend. (He doesn't help because he takes him everywhere) they are never apart. My boyfriend is a gaurd and he even takes him to work with him so when my boyfriend leaves this poor dog loses his mind! We have tried to let him stay home with me, I take him on walks and carry him around and love him and give him toys/treats etc but he refuses to not be with my boyfriend. He will cry/pee/howl/bark/whimper/claw/pace/scratch himself everywhere/lick all the signs of distress and I just don't know how we are going to get him out of it. I work too and we work different shifts so it's hard for me to have him here while my boyfriend is at work because I have to work in the mornings and the week he left him at home with me I didn't sleep a wink because of his anxiety. We have given him calming treats/put him in his crate with my boyfriends shirts/toys/treats etc (he even claws the crate while we are out for an hour or two till his toe nails bleed it's so pitiful) but it seems like nothing we do helps and we love him and want him to be happy but we also want to be happy too.

765,dogs,"Context, I have a dog as well (female Cocker Spaniel) and him and his wife have a female doodle dog (Poodle, Cocker, Cavalier mix), they weren't educated about it when they got her and found out she's from a puppy mill which has lead to a host of problems. They both get along very well and she is treated very well too.

The first issue being that she constantly obsessively licks my dog. Any dog really, but most often my dog whom she is very very attached to. It happens non stop and we have to seperate them. She licks her face obsessively and if they correct/ distract her she just goes right back to it. Do we really need to bring her to a behavioural therapist to curb this behavior?

She also enjoys stealing toys that aren't hers or toys that other dogs are playing with. We think its her way of engaging with them but it's very annoying and will potentially lead to fights. My dog gives in 90% of the time but it's unfair of her to have to give up toys she owns and they have tried to curb it, but it seems to just be a case of bad behavior due to poor breeding (?) so we don't know how to fix this as well. Nothing seems to work.

They have seen TWO trainers and are constantly using positive reinforcement methods but the only way she seems to learn anything, really is when she's yelled at and scared. An example is she has been taught to leave it, even with very high value treats, but in a real life scenario she never leaves it unless you yell at her. She also won't stop doing anything you tell her to (jumping up etc. even though she knows what it means) unless you shout at her to stop.

766,dogs," 

It's a really odd thing I've noticed amongst lots of groups and people, but there's this real obsession about needing to have the ""smart"" breeds. There's some particular people I know, they own a Border Collie, a GSD and a Blue Heeler. The Border Collie is the most anxious dog I've ever met and spends half the day staring at light reflections or shadows because nobody provides any entertainment or work for him, straight from a working line too (???). The GSD is fine but has a problem with getting too excited and grabbing peoples arms when they throw a ball, very tunnel vision. The Blue Heeler is still young, but is both dog and person aggressive. Collectively the only thing they really manage to teach the dogs to do is recall and to sit for food, and that is all done a bit heavy handedly.

The same owners think their neighbors Labrador who barks a lot is a dumb breed because it isn't used to them by now (the only thing they do is shout at it from across the fence from time to time).

These aren't the only ones like this, but they sparked the thoughts, I've just noticed some strange perceptions around dogs and their intelligence. Like a lot of owners just term whatever they think as desirable behavior = intelligence. The more regal, the patient GSD is seen as smart by the GSD owner, whereas the cunning bin thief Labrador is seen as smart by the Labrador owner but if the GSD owner thinks food thieving disobedience is bad they might call the food thieving Labrador dumb. And there's this big obsession with getting the most ""intelligent"" breeds, the thing is, none of them ever seem to nurture actual intelligent behavior or make any use of the dogs intelligence, like the Border Collie, or I know some individuals who have a GSD in a tiny city block of which is just runs circles in the tiny backyard all day and freaks out and goes into their weird state of ignoring all people when anyone more than it's owners are there.

Whereas some will look at the lazy mastiff and think that means it's dumb, because it's not inclined to do much and just be the stalwart defender of the front porch, attribute it to not much going on in the head, like somehow the Border Collies obsession with light reflections from watch faces is a more intelligent behavior.

Like the first owners I mentioned, the dog suited to them is absolutely the Mastiff, the lazy guardian or the small companion breed, not the Blue Heeler. They don't have any interest in doing anything with the actual dogs, they enjoy having the dogs and enjoy interacting with them in the house as companions, but the dogs develop so many problem behaviors because of the origin of their intelligence, and that energy is not directed anywhere else. So I think it ends up resulting in a dog that is pretty dumb in terms of crystalized intelligence / other areas, it doesn't know what it's doing and spends most of the day anxiously trying to let go of it's energy and more often than not becomes really hard to work with because of these almost pathological behaviors.

I think it also taps into the insecurity of some of the owners, they have these weird almost projected things they need to show off with their dogs ""breed"".

We just adopted a three year old 35ish pound Boston terrier mix to join our family, her name is Pepper. We‚Äôve had our 60lb shepherd mix Dovahkiin for two years, and he‚Äôs great.

Dovah is usually very confident and will play with any pup until they tire out. However, when Pepper playfully approaches Dovah, he just keeps backing up and avoiding her. Pepper will try to wrestle with Dovahkiin but he avoids it all. Specifically when pepper tries to nip at Dovahs heels and front paws. When we take them on walks, Dovah suddenly becomes playful with Pepper. So I tried playing with them both in the yard on a leash. It seemed to go well until I took them both off leash afterwards. Pepper was really riled up, there was a lot of aggressive growling and started biting Dovah (did not break skin). It appeared very much aggressive.

I stick my hand in there and it‚Äôs super hot, I stick my head in there and it just feels gross in there. 

Is that‚Ä¶ normal? I use it for indoor use, it‚Äôs normal temps indoors. I also have a regular wire kennel WITH a cover and it doesn‚Äôt get hot in there. 

I‚Äôm highly considering getting the Diggs travel kennel to replace my Noz2Noz / to be my new travel kennel since it seems to have better air flow‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs so ridiculously expensive. I can‚Äôt justify it?? But the

778,dogs,"Sorry for the long text, I'm bad at telling stories in a short way

So basically we've been to a dog park with our Australian Shepherd Maya and it always went great (except last year where she was a bit stressed out by being chased by 3 dogs but my knowledge about dogs was SHITTY then so I kinda laughed it off)
After months, she's 1,6 yo now, we went there again today. I actually got kind of anxious because my knowledge about a dogs body language, their behavior etc is waaay better now and I was scared to meet some ""not so good pups"" there since I heard some bad news since last year. As we got there, everything went fine at first. She did a small greeting with a chill chocolate lab and had a beautiful switch-chase play with a brown mutt. And then a Weimaraner (only know the german name) came up and everything went downhill. He was rough with every dog, pushed them, harrassed them and intended to sniff 'em until he decided he's done. But he got a mad eye on Maya and it was terrible. Wouldn't let her walk in her own directions, harrassed her, pushed her, threw his paws like wild into her face and chased her with her tail between legs. Tried calling her to me to ""save"" and calm her down but everytime she tried to come, he cutt off her way! Stood in front of me so I couldn't reach her, pushed and chased her away from me. She looked absolutely terrified and it nearly broke my heart. I'm not an adult yet and pretty shy when it comes to discussions so I stood beside the Weimaraner's owners and wanted them to call their dog so I just said like ""oh no"" , ""Ohh, that looks bad"" and they didn't give a shit. Today was the first time I saw her bare her teeth and snap at a dog. Still wouldn't move away. Dog then kept barking at her, making the lab nervous and bark at Maya too. Lab owner called her away, Weimaraner Owners still didn't give a shit. When I could finally manage to catch Maya, I told my uncle I wanted to leave and so we went to the gate. Weimaraner came out of a Bush, no owners in sigtht. This time I could manage to Block his way. Heard a name being called from far away and that's when he left. She was asbolutely terrified of him at the last encounter. Never going to the dog park again, it absolute broke my heart seeing my lovely pup stressed out and scared like that. What's your opinion about Dog Parks?
I also see this more as a kind of vent since no one in my family understood my fear for my dog today.

782,dogs,"**TL;DR:  Adopted a second dog (11 months) and having difficulty telling if he is actually good with our other dog (4 years), and when they are playing versus fighting.  General anxiety/ puppy blues about turning our routine and dog's happy life upside down.  Looking to hear that things will be fine  with patience and time...or, if not, looking for advice.**

My husband and I recently adopted a second dog. We have a 4 year old australian shepherd/ poodle mix that we adore, Arnie.  We thought about a second dog for a long time, and filled out a general application for a rescue at Thanksgiving. The process sped up after that, and we brought Ollie home on December 8th.

What we were looking for when adopting was a dog that was 2-4 years old, with less energy than Arnie.  We had gotten in to a good routine with Arnie and our work from home schedule.  Arnie was well-socialized and went to doggie daycare throughout the year, sometimes  multiple times a week.   He is insanely smart, and learns quickly. 

The adoption counselor that we worked with recommended Ollie.  He was younger than we were looking for (almost 11 months then) but we were told he had been fostered by an older woman and was very calm.  The meet and greet was about 30 minutes long, in a neutral location.  No toys, no food.  The counselor said the boys played well, and that Ollie backed off well when Arnie had too much.  We were given three options- say no, say yes and take him then, or take 24 hours to decide.

As I am sure you are familiar with, this little dog stole our hearts immediately and after no major issues during the meet and greet and with the encouragement of the counselor, we brought him home with us. 

The rescue said that Ollie was good with other dogs, but I wonder now if that was determined by a short car ride with other dogs.  There was no mention that the foster had another dog.  I also wonder if he was crated a lot of the time with his foster as he has limitless energy it seems.  There is little information available about him- he was a stray in Kentucky, and was in a shelter there.  The rescue we worked with takes adoptable dogs from that high-kill shelter and brings them to our state to find them homes. He had been with his foster about a week, and we think he had been in the initial shelter a week.  He is a terrier mix, per the shelter, and we've ordered a DNA test.  Our vet confirmed that his estimated age was correct.

He is very sweet and friendly, but is very much in puppy phase still.  We realized immediately that he has bad food aggression, and began feeding the dogs in separate rooms.  Arnie usually had access to food all day, and was a dog that just sort of grazed. But we couldn't leave out the dish anymore, so they have established meal times and are fed separately. This food aggression has also ruled out Kongs, treat balls, etc. for now.  

The boys love to play, but as humans we are having trouble recognizing when it is too much.  Ollie is about the same size as Arnie (maybe 10 pounds smaller)  but  is much stronger.  Ollie also has that puppy way of just leaping off of furniture onto Arnie as he passes.  It is sometimes like a constant wrestling match.  It looks too ferocious to us sometimes, so we will separate them and try to redirect.  It feels like we are missing that window where it goes from play to fighting, and I worry that one of them will be hurt.  There will sometimes be bared teeth and snarling and snapping.  

Ollie can be really mouthy, as puppies are. So we will get nipped occasionally, and we are working on teaching him not to bite (and not to jump).  The biting happens as the dogs play too, and sometimes it looks like Ollie is just gnawing on Arnie's legs or ears.  Arnie is pretty fluffy so he has some hair pulled out as they play.

We've had a few yelps and have tried, the last couple days, to keep Ollie more controlled by being on leash in the house.  We've tried to find a way to play with both of them at the same time,  where they can't then start wrestling immediately.  Arnie loves to be chased and Ollie is faster, so usually you'd get one ball toss in before they are wrestling.  If we play  with Arnie while Ollie is distracted with something to chew on, he will eventually get up and stalk Arnie.  It is hard to break his attention when he does that.  

Arnie has gotten jealous- as you'd expect from a former only child- but also really protective.  He doesn't like Ollie coming towards me. There is a lot of barking at Ollie if we try to play with him or pet him or train him.  We think that they sort of love each other as they are always trying to be together, but maybe that is just them wanting to be with the person that the other dog is with?

Basically....I am looking for any advice and some encouragement that it will get better.  I try to remember what a hellion Arnie was as a puppy, and that Ollie is light years better than that. And, I try to remember that this will all take time. It is new for all of us and we just need to be patient. 

The weather has been too bad and it is been below freezing for the last few days, so we haven't been able to blow of steam walking like we usually do.  And that is an escape hatch we all need.

I want to be a good home and family for Ollie, and I don't want Arnie to be miserable or get hurt.

787,dogs,"My dog is very velcro-ish in behavior, always has to be in my lap or at least the same room always. She has always slept in my bed with me pressed to my side (I don't roll). 

She's 6 now and she has a harder time with the human bed, and her new habits are super sweet. She hops up onto my bed at the start of the night to cuddle. This lasts until I fall asleep or after around 30 minutes. She then hops down and crawls inter her den under my side of the bed and sleeps there for the night. In the morning I still miraculously wake up to a doggy right next to me. A few mornings she wasn't there, and as soon as I stirred for the first time, she immediately crawled out and up to me.

788,dogs," \*\*Introduction\*\*  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be my first dog as an adult. I had some when I was a child, but it was my parents who were the responsible party. I've got no experience owning or training them.  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I prefer breeder. Rescue isn't a deal breaker, but as I'm new to training I'm not sure I'm going to be great at helping to heal trauma, and I'm nervous about not having any level of clarity on the genetics of the dog.  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* I want a shadow. A dog that wants to be a part of whatever you're doing and is always up for cuddles. Good with children, as I have a 3 and 5 year old, and preferably hypoallergenic. I don't mind a breed that will need frequent brushing, but would prefer that brushing not result in a trash bag of fur coming loose. 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* Currently looking at Cavapoo, because they are adorable, largley hypoallergenic due to poodle genes, and do not get too large for my home situation.  5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* Potty training is the only must. I'm not looking for a working dog, just a loving companion. If we can get more than that, it's all bonus.  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* Solely looking for a good companion.  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Daily, I imagine training will come in segments. Likely 1-2 hours in 15-30 minute increments. Play will likely be 3-4 hours per day at mid to high energy levels. Would prefer lower energy, as preferred interaction will be playing with the kids as the dog desires (kids are constantly being taught consent and autonomy, so playtime will be agreed upon by all parties, to include the dog), but for the adults we just want all the cuddles and lap time.  8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* We don't have a dog park nearby, but we do have a 3 acre backyard and friends and family with dogs. Visiting other dogs will likely be 1-3 times a week in the summer and as little as once or twice a month in the winter. Aside from playing with the high energy children, we will have daily jogs on our property in winter. In the summer there's a lot of travel including camping, hiking, and plenty of beach time.  9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Fully willing to pay or do ourselves. Weekly brushing would be nice, but daily is not a deal breaker. Willing to buy and learn whatever is necessary. Previous experience as a reptile keeper, so no stranger to pet expenses and tailored needs.  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Small to mid. Nothing larger than 50 lbs at full growth.  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Shedding is a no due to allergens. I realize that ""hypoallergenic"" isn't super accurate when describing dogs, but as close as reasonable is better. Barking is a mixed bag. Constant would be bad, but challenging is okay. Even though we're looking for smaller than a guard dog, letting us know someone is present is not a bad thing. Slobber is not ideal, but not a deal breaker. A good member of the family can be forgiven much, especially if it's beyond their control.  12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* That would be amazing, but isn't a requirement. If we can get there, we will, but if not we will work with our dog's needs to ensure safety  \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Definitely snuggly  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* Either way is fine. We've got a lot of love to give, but encourage self-determination.  15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Friendly demeanor. Challenging posture and barking is okay; actual aggression is not.  16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* If necessary, but would prefer not to. Most of our friends or family are dog people, and we're very big on functions and gatherings.  17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* Not that I can think of. I know chewing on things can be an issue, but I have plans to account for that during puppy stage. Chewing on things into and throughout adulthood would be bad, if we can't limit it to approved items, I suppose.  \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* Dog will likely never be left alone. My wife works from home and when we travel our pets go with us.  19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* Myself and my wife will be responsible for training and care. My children will be taught to help with potty duties and engaging play/exercise. Children are looking for something they can play with that will not scare them, and wife is looking for a companion while working in the home office.  20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* Currently only other pet is a two year old Brazilian rainbow boa. I do rehab reptiles in my area, so there are some short term visitors, but they are largely terrarium-based.  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Yes. I have a 15 year old who is gone a lot (school, basketball, football, and track),  a 5 year old in kindergarden and a 3 year old in pre-school who are very much looking for a playmate.   22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent, but have no restrictions as long as I pay a pet deposit. I will be buying a house in the next few months.  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in a very rural area in the United States. There are no local ordinances with regard to dog breeds. I believe my state limits any amount of wolf blood without a license, but no other restrictions.  24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* Average summer temp is 72 degrees Fahrenheit and average winter temp is 27 degrees Fahrenheit.  \*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* No additional information.  26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",t2_30z3o5s2,0,[Help] [Breeds] First time dog owner advice on breed selection.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] üìùRecommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] üìùRecommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,zv71z8,True,CardiologistOk1614,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zv71z8/help_breeds_first_time_dog_owner_advice_on_breed/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zv71z8/help_breeds_first_time_dog_owner_advice_on_breed/,2475181,1672003483,0,,False,1672003502,1672003503,2022-12-25 21:24:43,,,,,,,

790,dogs,"so i rescued a dog from a kill shelter about a little over a year ago. she is now 1.5 years. i dont think she was abused but she spend the first 6 months in a cage w all her siblings only getting food and thats it. this makes her scared of unexpected thigs like flags, metal sounds,  chairs moving aprubtly etc
shes the sweetest girl, her personality is very gentle, super sweet, doesnt touch any of my stuff even plushies shes really a perfect dog. 

she just has some quirks, at first when we started going for walks she was terrified, we worked on it alot and it got better. she loved going on grass. suddenly out of nowhere one day she refused to go on the grass no matter what i tried. i would try to pick her up and put her on it sometimes it works but sometimes she would run off it again as fast as she can.
she would find other spots of grass that she would go on but avoid the old spots if that makes sense. 
fine, well go on the new spots only. 
suddenly she will refuse the new spots as well, and find another spot, sometimes even just the street. 

sometimes i get very frustrated because of this especially during our night walk before bed. im an anxious person and dont like being outside at night and her not peeing really bothers me. i can feel myself getting angry with her but really dont want to. she has to pee before bed but she just wont go

799,dogs,"Hey everyone,
I just wanted to share my experience with dog meds I found that‚Äôs been a game changer for my dog's hurt foot.
About a month ago, my dog started limping and we couldn't figure out what was wrong. After a visit to the vet, we learned that he had strained a muscle in his foot and was in a lot of pain.
The vet gave us some expensive pain medication, but I wasn't comfortable with the idea of giving my dog hard drugs long-term. So, my family and I started looking into natural alternatives.
Basically I stumbled upon this all natural product that‚Äôs made from a blend of plant-based ingredients like turmeric, ginger, and boswellia, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.
I was a bit skeptical at first, but we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did! Within just a few days, my dog's limp was gone and he was back to his playful self haha.
I‚Äôm so happy he's not experiencing any pain or discomfort anymore.

801,dogs,"Hi, I'm looking for some input on what to do in this situation. It's somewhat tempting to submit a noise complaint to management but I'd feel bad. I moved into my apartment a couple of months ago and the person I share a wall with has a dog that barks on and off for hours whenever she's away (multiple times a week. Oftentimes it's through the night). I can hear her telling the dog not to bark when she leaves. I can hear her reprimanding the dog for barking when she gets back. Based on what I can hear, I doubt that she's doing any training. The dog either needs training, medication, or both. Just SOMETHING.

The part that complicates it a bit is that I have a dog with mild separation anxiety too. He barks for 5-10 minutes when I leave him then calms himself and sleeps until I get back. I have a home camera I watch him on. I'm trying different methods to help him and we're picking up professional training again soon. We did it before but it was unsuccessful because he needed time to adjust to his new home with me but I think he's ready for it now. The vet doesn't want to medicate him because of how mild his condition is and he's only 10 months so he's expected to grow out of it.

I don't want to create any drama or get anyone in trouble especially when I have a dog with a similar problem but it's ridiculous.

Every other week we talked to the vet about quality of life and if it was time. Our girl had really bad anxiety especially in the car, so when it was time we paid extra to have the vet come to the house to do it. Worth every penny, but that much more traumatizing for us to do it on our living room floor.

We agreed no talking about getting a dog until after the holidays. But I work from home and our house just felt so lonely.

I saw a dog on Facebook who needed to be rehomed and I brought it up to my husband. He went from ‚Äúno‚Äù to thinking about it to on board.

I've tried hosing to break it up and hose it away but it doesn't really break down very easily once it's been in the sun for a day. I tried hot water but also doesn't seem to do much or I'd need a whole lot to get anywhere.

I recently adopted a rescue with my husband. She's a sweet little thing, very unreactive to other dogs. (We always feel like a proud parent when other dogs we walk past go crazy but she just strolls calmly by.)

However, she's quite protective of us and when I walk her alone, or my husband walks her alone, she'll go for a few hundred meters and then plant herself down and look back at the path we came from. After much pulling and cajoling, she'll go a bit more and then plant herself down again. Sometimes, this carries on till we give up or go home, but if we're more insistent, she might stop and walk fairly normally the rest of the way.

836,dogs,"This is a long summary of today's events because I am a first time dog owner and if someone has the patience to read it all and provide feedback I'd be incredibly grateful! I want to know if I was doing things right today and how to prepare for tomorrow.

I just adopted a 1 y.o lab mix 5 days ago. Unknown background before being in a shelter since august, had been found as a stray. She's a huge handful so far, wasn't trained that much and not potty trained but shes already getting better and learning quickly. She lives with a 3 y.o. female mini pincsher and they get along okay. At times she plays too rough but we are working on that. 

Christmas eve, today, we had as slow of an introduction as we could to 3 dogs and a bunch of people as we brought her and her crate with us to a family member's house for dinner. Shes not quite ready to be crated at home for more than 3 hours and the roads were too bad to go back and forth. She usually pees every 2 hours and I suspect she may have a bladder infection or something. Her first vet appt. isnt until tuesday.

Before the introduction I had let her sniff around outside a little and she went potty. The introductions went well, I held her harness gently but securely and kneeled down next to her and let the two tiny dogs sniff her and her sniff back. I was worried she would be overexcited as she was when we first adopted her and introduced her to our mini pincsher that she would trample them like she did with her but she was calmer today, I think she got enough exercise to tire her out earlier in the day, but I think she was also ""calm"" due to her anxiety.

There was another larger dog her size but that dog didnt seem to like her much. That one is 8, and when she first met our mini pincsher she was excited and playful. With the lab though she barely wagged her tail and just kinda didnt care. It was weird. However there was a lot going on around the room during their introduction so that likely affected it.

After introductions we brought her to her crate in a quieter room away from the main chaos but her separation anxiety came out and she was barking and whining to be let out, but I only gave in once to go try to calm her down and when I did she got worse so I tried not to after that. At home shes gotten good at being in the crate but of course this is a whole new environment. She eventually settled and I gave her a treat a little bit after so she would know being quiet in the crate = good. I also gave her a treat here and there for other things like pottying outside. When it came time for dinner, and everyone moved to the dining room next to that room, I walked her around the house a little bit to explore on-leash. 

We were dumb and forgot her kong we were going to put some peanut butter in, but fortunately there were some large durable marrow bone things to gnaw on, though she would lose interest in them quickly.

After a little walk and exploration she went back in her crate. Halfway through dinner she got loud and even the other dogs got riled up so we moved her to a quieter room further away from us so she couldnt hear all the loud talking and chaos. That did calm her down. After dinner a few family members convinced me to let her out. At first I kept the loop at the end of her 6ft leash on my wrist and stayed with her, she tried to go under the christmas tree (shes too big though) and jump on their couch and there were so many other things able to be knocked over or eaten within her reach which is why I just had her tethered to me. Her first day with us she was so hyperactive. She wasn't today but I just wanted to be careful because she could go from 0 to 100 very quickly, has before.

I carefully let her sniff the decorated tree and the couch and stuff to kind of get her curiousity satisfied. After a little bit I trusted her a little bit more because she ignored almost everything I had worried about so I let her leash just drag and still kept an eye her for a while. There were some small soft toys that kept finding their way back onto the ground though which she tried to eat and/or destroy so I kept having to quickly take those away. Turned out a family member didnt know she couldnt have them and kept tossing them back on the ground. She has a big head and a big mouth and doesnt know better. Her first morning with us she puked twice in a row and it was a lot of toy parts from the shelter and one piece of a toy we gave her before we found out she cant have soft toys for more than like 5 seconds. She will eat a part before you even realize she ripped a piece off if you dont watch her. And anything small enough to be barely visible or not visible in her mouth I dont want her to choke on either.

So she laid down at one point to chew on one of those bones and I felt like I could take my eye off her a minute. I took her out just before and she went pee AND poop which I was so very proud of her for! But 5 minutes later I look over at her and she's peeing a lot on their hardwood floor (better than carpet at least!) and then dragged her leash through it so I had to crate her again and clean up everything. I think when I thought she peed she ended up only going a little bit. While she was back in her crate she did take a nap even with us in the same room so that was good.

Fortunately she hadnt had any accidents other than that one and overall behaved very well! It was very exhausting for me though and I barely interacted with anyone when she was out if her crate. I feel bad. I feel drained.

All my worries:
Giving her too much freedom
Not giving her enough freedom
Balancing freedom and safety
Her jumping onto tables and counters which she has done at home a few times
Her peeing and/or pooping inside
Her eating something she shouldnt
Her destroying something either accidentally or on purpose (at home when she gets too excited playing with the other dog she bounces off the couch and nearly plowed into the window above the couch once because she jumps high and fast and isn't very coordinated yet, like a giant puppy)
Her getting excited and plowing over fragile things, people, other dogs
And near the end of the night, the other large dog when chilling in her bed ""mean"" barked at her for seemingly no reason just from her approaching calmly to be curious (didnt stare or anything). She wasn't guarding her bed, she got up and followed her sideways like she does when she is protecting us. I dont know what prompted that, but I wonder if theres a body language cue I'm missing with my dog. She is definitely anxious all the time except when im holding a treat or when we play or cuddle. She thinks shes a lap dog and when she looks at me those times she doesnt have those sad eyes. But the rest of the time she's either got those sad eyes and walks slow or paces from one side of the apartment to the other. So when she was walking around calmly today it wasnt her being relaxed and happy it was her usual anxiety she has had since day 1.

We were there from 5 ish to 11 ish. Tomorrow we will be arriving around 1 and staying for who knows how long. Hoping for any advice at all. I want her to be as least anxious as possible and also not get hurt or break anything. I also want to not have to constantly worry and spend time with family.

843,dogs,"Hey there, hoping that posting here can provide me with some helpful next steps to take. 

I recently moved in with my boyfriend of one year. I brought my two cats along and he brought his dog. I absolutely love living with my boyfriend overall, he‚Äôs extremely considerate and we get along well. However, we have one major issue - his very reactive dog.

I love all dogs (and animals). That‚Äôs a big reason why I‚Äôve been struggling so much with how I‚Äôm feeling. His dog is incredibly hard to live with. Beginning with when I met her, she barked every time I would come over. My boyfriend told me to not look her in the eye and she eventually got better. However, to this day, she even barks at me sometimes when I come into our new house together. I didn‚Äôt think this was a huge deal. 

My concerns started before we moved in. She has severe separation anxiety. My boyfriend used to insist on taking his dog everywhere with us. Otherwise, she has to be put in daycare whenever he left the house. If daycare wasn‚Äôt open, she had to be crated. She absolutely loses her mind in her crate - she barks, cries, and anxiously chews the entire time. She‚Äôs even chewed through her (high quality) crate. 

This means that we always have to make our plans around his dog (for example, we may not be able to go out sometimes, or we have to be back by 4 pm to pick her up from daycare). Her separation anxiety is so bad that my boyfriend cannot even leave the room, take the trash out, or take a shower without her going bezerks. She already chewed one of the baseboards in our house when he was taking a shower. If she‚Äôs not chewing, she paces and cries incessantly. Just my presence isn‚Äôt enough to calm her, as much as I‚Äôve tried. My boyfriend gives her medicine for this, but she acts this way even medicated. 

I could deal with this issue if that were it, though. The biggest problem is her aggression. I had to finally tell my boyfriend that he should not take his dog to public places (he used to bring her with us to restaurants, bars, festivals). This is because she gets very tense and will lunge, snarl, growl, and bark at people. Remember that she is a pit bull mix so she is very intimidating. She makes people incredibly uncomfortable and I feel absolutely terrible. The tipping point was when she lunged at a kid who was simply walking by. I was mortified and terrified.

Now, living with her has just amplified all of these issues. She gets very tense around my cats. One of my cats is a little scared of her, and this makes his dog want to chase him. They have run into each other a couple times and his dog does her usual snarling and barking and lunging which makes me really nervous. Because of this, my one cat is always hiding under the bed and not able to enjoy the house. My other cat is a tripod and would not be able to get away. I live in constant fear of what would happen if she got ahold of one of my cats. 

Lastly, a huge issue is when people come to visit. She not only barks, but she corners them and snarls. She‚Äôs also incredibly protective of my boyfriend. She has bit my dad twice, one of these times was when my dad went to shake my boyfriend‚Äôs hand. It‚Äôs to the point where my dad, who loves dogs, is visibly uncomfortable. My best friend came to visit the other night, and his dog had cornered her and was growling at her, making my friend really nervous.

My boyfriend didn‚Äôt really do anything, which is part of the problem. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I stupidly tried to pet her to try to diffuse the situation. She bit my wrist. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt do anything except stand there. This was the final straw for me. After 
I got home, I had a serious talk with him about things. I told him how tense I have been feeling, how nervous I am about my cats getting hurt, and how I am not happy with her behavior toward people. He responds well to serious issues, but he told me that training was really expensive and that he would try to figure it out. I just want a concrete plan because I don‚Äôt think I can continue living this way. Not to mention, I want to have kids in the future and his dog is not good with children at all. I can‚Äôt even relax about my cats so I can‚Äôt imagine a kid.

I guess my question is, how do I hold my boyfriend accountable for a plan? How do I ease my concerns in the meantime? And how do I help him even though I can‚Äôt help him financially right now? Will my cats and future children be safe? I want to fix this without causing resentment between us because I really love him.",t2_5qdt3pzo,0,Reactive dog (2 year old female pit bull/cattle dog mix) is causing tension in my relationship,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zurrs1,True,memphistaylor17,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zurrs1/reactive_dog_2_year_old_female_pit_bullcattle_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zurrs1/reactive_dog_2_year_old_female_pit_bullcattle_dog/,2474989,1671947333,0,,False,1671947344,1671947344,2022-12-25 05:48:53,,,,,,,

850,dogs,"Hello! I have a beautiful 8mo pitbull who quite literally came to me in one of the worst times of my life. I won't get into the fine details of what I'm going through, but I struggle with Major Depressive Disorder as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and just underwent a lot of trauma this past fall. My dog showed up in a friend's backyard, and I immediately took her in because we both got very attached to each other very quickly- she gets along great with my cat, is a quick learner, and just has so much love to share that I fell for her so fast. Fast forward about 2 months, and I have new roommates move in with me. My puppy is very sweet to everyone, but can tend to not listen to or even act disrespectful with people who are not me. On top of the struggles I have already been going through, my dog's own struggles with listening to my roommates as well as our trainer has just been burning me out, and my roommates are determined to have me re-home her. They believe that she is not receiving enough stimulation or space for her age, and while I understand the space problem (we have a 2 bedroom apartment, no backyard, and I sleep in the living room), I argued that I work at a doggy daycare so she gets free daycare on top of her daily runs, so I never felt like that was much of a problem. The real issue is I haven't been able to find time to take care of myself with all the training and walks and constant supervision that my dog requires at her age. I suspect she was abandoned by her last owner with how terrible her separation anxiety is (crate training has done very little to help, this is something I plan on finding a new trainer for) so I feel incredibly guilty about having to re-home her. I have a coworker who is interested in her so it wouldn't be like I am losing her entirely, but I don't want her to feel abandoned once again. I asked about just having her fostered until I can get back on my feet, but my roommates are adamant that this be permanent. I know I need to learn to give her up for both our sakes- if anyone understands this situation or has been through something similar themself I would appreciate any advice on learning to forgive myself for leaving the dog I planned on keeping forever.

853,dogs,"I do ultramarathons for fun. During the training season I may be doing more than 80km a week. Off-season, maybe 40km a week at least. I run at least 3 times a week minimum and go for walks once or twice every day.

I would love a dog someday as a running buddy, preferably a 'scary-looking' dog as I'm young and female so it would be nice to have a certain level of safety/deterrence (I don't necessarily need it to actually be able to fight, just LOOK scary).

My main concern is, can any dog breed handle that distance per week? Also, how far can a dog run at a time? I usually run 8km as an easy run, 13km as a good hard run, and 19-25km as a really long run (very rarely).

I know husky/sled breeds are good for long distances but I live in a very hot country, where 30¬∫ C (86F) days are pretty common in summer, and there are usually a couple week-long stretches of 40¬∫C (104F). I generally will not run if it is more than 25¬∫C (77F) (so I run at night/morning).

I run on dirt trails. Some parts are not super well-maintained and you occasionally have to bush-bash a little through dense shrubbery. The trails are very hilly and often quite rocky/cobbly too. Would this be a problem for dogs' paws? There is also a lot of wildlife - I have run into kangaroos, echidnas, snakes (extremely venomous), and possums. I wouldn't want a dog that could get overexcited, run after a roo, and get disembowelled lol.

I often run into a guy on this one trail who has a Belgian Malinois. I think they're the most gorgeous dogs I've every seen. His dog is so graceful and beautiful, very gentle and friendly, and responsive. He tells me he went to a breeder and described his lifestyle, and the breeder picked the smallest, most low-energy of the litter (so his dog is a bit more laid-back than most of the breed).

Is a Belgian Malinois a good type of dog for this lifestyle? Or is some other breed better? Is 80km per week on these trails too much for any dog?

at the vet, they required i put almost 3k down for some reason. they estimated the cost could be up to 4.5k even after she had been stabilized and responded perfectly to the sedative they gave her. so she was just in the monitoring phase. i thought i was gonna pass out from the number and unfortunately i was only approved for 1100 on care credit, denied scratch, and my debit card only allowed a daily charge amount of 1500. (im 24, this was my first credit card and i only have a car loan and one student loan so my credit is good just not really a lot of history) they took it all and let me go with just that. luckily the final bill was 1300 and they gave me the rest back.

857,dogs,"For Extra large dogs - you have the Newfoundland, the Leonberger, and possibly the St Bernard, Bernese Mountain as gentle giants, very family focused, and a decent choice for a first dog.  The only reason it's not an excellent choice is due to size, drool, and shed level.

Large dogs you have the classic golden retriever, family/show line labradors, and poodles are all excellent excellent excellent family dogs.

In the small to toy category, you've got miniature poodles, toy poodles, bichons, papillons, yorkies, cavs, poms, etc.

But we are really missing that ""medium"" rung.

There's the Shetland Sheepdog, American Eskimo (German Spitz) Keeshond if you want that poofy long-coat

Poodle can sneak in here, a larger than average Mini, a smaller than average Standard, but neither traditional sizes really fit.  (There is a medium size, the Moyen, it's just European not American)

American Cocker Spaniel used to be the other main option, but they were ruined with overbreeding. If you can get a time machine and get one from the 1950s it would be a good choice.

Whippets are good pets kind of by default or accident rather than custom built for the task.

And unfortunately, this gap is where the hybrids are coming in.

Most of the doodles I am seeing are lab/golden x with a miniature poodle to make something that ends up being the same size as a ""moyen"" poodle.

People are crossing pomeranians with Huskies for medium size better pet husky lookalikes.

Heck the Puggle, a beagle x pug, wasn't a bad choice.  Pugs are good pets if it weren't for the myriad of health and structure problems.  Beagles can be really independent, vocal, 

Now seeing ""miniature goldens"" - no, not duck tollers, but golden x cocker (sometimes with poodle) which is a round-about repair to the damage done to the American Cocker.

I think if people got off the hybrid kick and actually created something like a mini-goldendoodle that bred true for 10 generations, where parents were health screened, and the hypoallergenic stories were curtailed, you'd have a very nice dog.  

Same with the Pom-sky and miniature golden.

Very few breeds were created unintentionally over time. Most were created by mixing various different purebreds and often some mutts as well to create the goal the breeder envisioned.

867,dogs,"hi i have a 8 year old minpin that is extremely anxious and nervous around other people

or even when going outside, most of the time she is at home and if i had to guess

thats what made her so anxious,, although i take her for a walk almost daily

around 15-20 mins.

She is extremely fond of my mother since she spoils her so much i think she kinda sees her

as her mother as well.

But the thing that troubles me is that she randomly get this agressive behavior towards me whenever

i interact with her.

and it's been a lot more often recently.

some examples:

1. i could grab her and move her away from me when she was younger with no problem at all, but recently i had a day she started growling at me when i tried to grab her and i let her go immediately.

i got mad at her and yell at her and hit her softly (i didn't hurt her) and she growled back

2. other day i was playing with her and tried to grab her toy and she started growling back at me and i yelled at her again.

and today got the worst experience with her so far. here's the story

I got a visit from my brother and his dog (a labrador btw) she really hates my brother because he often messes up with her in a playful manner (not meaning any harm). also she ran to my mother everytime my brother's labrador tried to sniff her and growl back at him

anyway, she starts to feel very anxious and nervous when people or animals mess around with her

she probably would start to feel it too if i did the same (never tried it)

i was lying down on my sofa and my brother was next to me on my right and my mom on my left but we were all calm down and watching TV

so, my minpin starts to crawl on me on my belly and got her face really close to mine

i thought she wanted affection so i went with it.

guess what

she growled and bite my face, luckily nothing too serious, just some teeth marks and blood

i got really mad and yell at her and honestly i'm still pissed off and thinking if i should let her near me or not

Why? why did she do this?

i've been with her since she was born and she never did this when she was younger

but the older she gets the more unpredictable she gets near me and honestly i'm

feeling to lose some trust on her towards me, i won't know what will be the next thing

that will trigger an attack by her.

even though we play daily, take a walk together. Where am i failing?

She rarely does this to my mother only when she is being overspoiled and she feels annoyed by it

and the times i saw it she often warned my mother about it, like growing only but never bite

it's useless speaking to my mother anyway because she will keep spoiling her and treating her like a baby, even if i try to discipline her it won't help much if my mother doesn't cooperate, so i'm out of options here.

what i find weird is that she was never like this before towards me, why now?

869,dogs,"Been trying to find a dog for sometime now and it's just hard and frustrating :(

It just seems like its so hard to get a dog now a days.

Many shelters have seemingly obtuse criteria who for they deem worthy; often times the desirable dogs get 'pulled' magically the second they show up by rescue groups and thus those desirable breeds become unavailable.

The rescue groups have the same issue but come with an even higher price tag.

Trying to find a breeder is also filled with fraught. Can't ask publically because people will shame you for wanting to ""shop"". Looking online often the results are backyard breeders with slick advertising to pass off a hobbyist breeding operation, rather than a young couple trying to earn a 'side hustle'. The few results via AKC clubs have websites that haven't been updated since AOL dialup times. Other breeders have waitlists that are 1-2 years out, and that's if you can even afford the cost.

I ask my co-workers where they got their dogs...oh we just got her as a gift when she was a puppy...or we found her on facebook, a breeder had a litter.

Luckily he doesn‚Äôt ever bite hard enough to do any damage or even break the skin.

886,dogs," \*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* No we have owned a few dogs before.  

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I think we'd like to rescue a dog, but would definitely like to get a younger dog that we could get trained.  

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* We just had to put to sleep our last dog who was a Heeler mix but not sure what he was mixed with. What we loved about him was how affectionate he was. He absolutely adored us and always wanted to cuddle when we were around. He also loved to play fetch with his Jolly Ball in our backyard. He was a medium/small dog around 24 lbs. He was really the perfect dog for us, but he didn't always get along with other dogs well... he wouldn't fight but he just got weird and barked a lot. Also, he was never potty trained and stayed mainly in our basement in a gated area. We really want a dog that can be easily potty trained that could roam the house and will get along better with other dogs and is about the same size as our previous dog and just as affectionate.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* We have started researching different breeds but don't have a particular breed in mind yet.  

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* We really just want our dog to be potty trained and understand basic commands.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* We aren't big sports people and mainly would just throw a ball around in our backyard.  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* We want a dog that can roam the house and be with us at all times and go out into the backyard to play periodically throughout the day. We have over an acre backyard and plenty of space to run around.  

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* Our neighborhood isn't very walkable unfortunately, but our backyard is over an acre and has plenty of room to run around and play. We would take them on walks in nearby parks periodically.  

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* We'd definitely brush them but would take them to a professional for other things.  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Medium sized maybe around 20lb to 35lb, but could go bigger if they were the right fit.

888,dogs,"Hello!

I need help deciding whether I should get insurance for my 13-year-old Cockapoo. As far as medical history goes:

1. Pancreatitis at age 5
2. Hip dislocation at age 10 (vet popped it back in)
3. I also recently noticed that both of his eyes look a bit cloudy, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a problem / how severe it is.

He is an active dog and has no problems apart from these. 

If I go through with insurance, it‚Äôll probably be with Pets Best (around 100/month). My main concern is with the insurance rate potentially going up (especially if something major happens), as I‚Äôve seen reviews of pet insurance companies along those lines.

Could anyone with Pets Best share their experience &amp; shed some light on whether it is worth it? Things to look out for (if I should even go for it at all) would also be highly appreciated! 

My dog‚Äôs annual exam is next month, so before that, I need to decide on the insurance.

889,dogs,"I've taken my dog to my grandma's for Christmas, we introduced them outside in the park. My dog was off lead and my grandma's dogs were on long leads as they don't have reliable recall. My grandma's dogs pulled and barked which made my dog a bit reactive. But I kept taking him away and calming him down then going back for them to say hello and get to know them.

Inside the house my dog growls if the other dogs get near and has barked and snarled at them. I realise there will be a bit of this as they get to know each other but it seems to be worse when I'm around. If I'm out of the room they get on okay and there isn't any growling. 

I'm assuming it's some sort of protective growling, but I don't know how to manage it. I've tried putting my dog out of the room, I've tried saying 'no' or 'ah-ah'. It doesn't seem to make a difference as he'll just do it again next time the other dogs get near. I don't want him to keep practicing the behaviour but I'm at a loss as to what to do.

Luckily when I've been away at school or work my mom has always been home bc of her remote job. This means he's never truly been alone, a few years in we actually adopted a second dog which has only given him more company when I'm not around or when I'm occupied at the house. I'm really happy that he lives in this kind of environment. 

I'm moving away in September to a downtown part of a city so I'll be sharing a small apartment with two other roommates. My dog is a daily part of my life and i can't imagine leaving him, but i also don't want to completely turn his world upside down by changing his home and getting rid of his other companions. It just kills me to think about how he'd be home alone when he's just not used to that while I'm gone. 

My house is 45 min away from where I'm planning to move to so i could do visits every month or two but i just don't know if it will be bad for him to move.

The funny and a bit weird is that my lab always barks and soft barks when the cat and the maltese are playing. He plays with them sometimes, but always barks and whines. üòÇ

When he plays with other dogs outside its all fine. 

Is it because he is defending the maltese from the cat? Is he triggered by their shenanigans in the flat? Is he annoyed or?

903,dogs,"This is probably gonna be a bit of a rant and a long read, but I can't stop thinking about it and wanted to write it out.

For background, my dog is extremely afraid of fireworks ever since some kids threw them at her last year around New Year's. She wasn't a fan before that, but it was still in the normal and manageable range. After that incident it was straight up panic everytime. Specifically the fire arrows with the high pitch sounds. Added to that incident, on New Years eve my neighbour (we live in the Netherlands, so when I say neighbour, I mean they're straight up 2 meters away from our backyard) had a full blown illegal fireworks package. It was insane. I had to rush my dog to the animal hospital at 11pm, where they gave her Sileo to sedate her. It was awful. 

Fast forward to the issue. Since last year was so bad, I made preparations with her vet. I had her on a natural remedy early on and closer to the holidays I gave her light medication every day, and I have Sileo as a back-up for New Years as a last resort. I've booked a cottage in nature with my friend and her dog, so we won't be around any cities or towns that will have fireworks. 

However, there's been a lot of fireworks bangs in town lately. Nothing major, but she has definitely noticed and is a bit more easily spooked by sound in general now, but she's been doing really well. Until today, when I want to pick her up from my friends house (they sometimes come and get her for playdates and cuddles), and we walked out the door and two incredibly loud bangs went off close by. She freaked and ran to our house, dragging me with her. We went inside and her tail was completely against her belly and she was panting. Okay, very understandable, I was spooked as well. I grabbed some dried lung treats (her favourite) and did some training with her. She was very hesitant, but eventually she mostly snapped out of it and shook it off. We still needed to go for our midday walk, so I decided to put her in the car and drive to our happy place. Its a designated off-leash dog area. A nice hour walk at a familiar place, where we know most dogs we come across so big chances for playtime. Surely there wouldn't be any fireworks in a big area for dogs, I thought. Especially since it's a very popular area among locals. 

Well, I was wrong. We walked our first bit perfectly fine, she was sniffing and running through the grass. And then I heard fireworks. The kind that sends her into distress immediately. Thankfully she ran towards me, so I immediately leashed her. The thing is, I have a giant sized dog. She's 120lbs lean muscle. And she didn't want to move. I couldn't go in any direction and she was in complete panic. I eventually got her to a point where I could see who was playing with the fireworks. I thought they were abouts 14yo boys or something (note: it is an area that has a high up point to walk, and a lower point to walk, with a stone stairway that connects them at certain point. They were high and I was standing at the low road) It was quite busy at that spot, because it was a bit of a crossroad point. Literally no one was gonna say anything, and I could see how many dogs were stressed. I decided to say something, but I was so angry and emotional that it completely came out horrible. I literally yelled at this poor kids from the top off my lungs that they had to get the hell out, what are they thinking to use fireworks here, leave, I'll call the cops. I was so, so angry. I even seem to forget the fact that there were people around me. Obviously my energy didn't help my dog either. The boys left, but my dog was frozen again. I stood there with her, trying to calm down and talk to an older man that came by. She seemed to feel better a bit, but still wouldn't move.

Then I saw the boys coming down the steps, towards us. To my shock, they turned out to be only about 10 years old and their faces seemed so nice. I was still upset, but was calm and I asked them to look at my dog, and how scared she is. I asked them why they decided to play here. They said they thought they did the right thing by going upstairs, and not downstairs. I explained that dogs have really good hearing and they will hear you from very far away. They asked where they are supposed to go then. I told them that I didn't know, but they needed to not be in a place specifically for dogs, especially an off-leash area. They actually apologised. Then I apologised for how I spoke to them. And then we parted ways. 

I didn't want to leave the area when my dog was still so stressed. I didn't want to ruin our happy place. So I pulled out all the stops to get her to relax and shake it off and when that happened and she played and raised her tail again, we went home. She's now happily sleeping on my bed, with a full belly. 

The thing is, I can't stop thinking about how I acted and about all the people who saw it. I walk there every day and I see these people multiple times a week in passing. I have social anxiety and I just can't stop fixating on that part. I just needed to write it out. Thank you for reading if you made it to the end.

The vets have been back and forth about whether it‚Äôs a lung or digestive issue because of his wheezing after coughing, but they were pointing more towards digestive since his lungs sound fine upon closer inspection.

- Cephalexin
- Amoxicillin
- Metoclopramide
- Prednisolone
- Cisapride
- Temaril-P

912,dogs,"Was at the dog park having a great time with my dog.  Everyone was there having fun.  Some dude shows up with his dog and a ball.  He starts throwing the ball for his dog, and my dog chases after it too, because.....well, she's a dog.  My dog got the ball half the time which seemed to infuriate the dude.  After this happened a few times, the dude gets in my face and angrily says, ""Why don't you bring your own ball for your dog?!""  My reaction was basically, woah!  I said, hey I'm sorry but if you bring a ball to a dog park, other dogs are probably going to also chase it.  He replies ""Yeah well I can't even exercise my dog because yours keeps stealing his ball!""  I suggested that if he is only here to exercise his dog, he might want to come when it's less busy, or take his dog to an open field.  

I then went to the other side of the park to get away from him.  All of a sudden I see him grab my dog's collar (who is still a puppy by the way) to give his dog a head start.  As I walked over to him he lets go of my dog. I wanted to say a hundred things to him but I was really angry and didn't want to ruin everyone's Christmas Eve.  So I took my pup and left.

Unfortunately, once she's on the leash, she becomes a completely different dog. She doesn't pull anymore because I put her through training, so the only thing we still need to work on is her aggression towards other dogs. A few weeks ago, we were walking and ran into our neighbor with her small dog. My dog has met this dog once or twice before, with no issues, so I wasn't too worried. For some reason, as that dog began to sniff my dog, my dog got incredibly aggressive, pulling on the leash, barking, and trying to scare that other dog off. my dog doesn't do any of this off leash with other dogs, in fact she's very playful yet respectfully stern if another dog gets to be too much. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I was completely shocked and apologetic because while my dog has had a barking issue while on walks, it's never gotten to the point of lunging or anything. 

What can I do to help calm my dog down in situations like this? We try to avoid as many dogs as we can on walks , and I've been using dog corrector hissing air (just a can of compressed air that makes an unpleasant noise) which has helped break her attention and barking.

919,dogs," \*\*Introduction\*\* 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

\* My family and I have had dogs all my life. We have kept a lot of different breeds over the years and I've rescued and fostered a lot of mixed strays. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? 

\* My boyfriend and I will be emigrating to Norway (Bergen, specifically) for my postgraduate studies and his work. I would love to continue adopting and would prefer not to go to a breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* I'm a long-distance runner and my last foster mix was an amazing running buddy that I miss dearly, so I'd love to do that again with my next dog. My boyfriend is also a hiker so he'd want a hiking buddy as well.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* We've tried to look up local shelters and welfare groups. I'm not too fussed about breed so I'm open to any breed including mixes. I am interested in polar dogs as I thought they might be better suited to the climate in Norway. I noticed that there are some options for rehoming older retired draft dogs like malamutes, and Siberian/Alaskan Huskies, though I do not have experience with these breeds as I've never lived in a country with a temperature climate before. I've also seen a lot of other working dogs like GSDs and akitas that need homes.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* I usually like to teach my dogs basic commands and to be peepad/grass trained.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

\* I don't intend to compete or use the dog for work. Just for casual long-distance runs with me and hikes with my boyfriend.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* I'd be home most of the time to attend to the dog. But I can foresee 3-4 hour gaps in a day where I'd have to be on campus for labs, classes, meetings, etc over the course of my PhD. My boyfriend will be working a normal 9 to 5.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* I run every other day and usually clock about 5-10k of mileage during the run. My boyfriend would  do 1hr walks or hikes every other day as well. we're able to head down to dog parks too.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* I'd brush and bathe the dog as required but for trimming, ears, nails, and anal glands - i'd usually bring my dog to a professional.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Preferably a medium to large dog

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* I'm okay with shedding. Barking is fine too as long although i'd prefer not to have a 'reactive' breed. Also would prefer minimal slobber

12) How important is letting your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* no preference

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Would prefer a snuggle dog but I'm not fussed about this as I've fostered skittish strays before.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  

\* no preference

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* no preference

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* we would be a single-dog household so no preference

17) Are there other behaviours you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  

\* no preference

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* 3-4hours during the day

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* NA

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* No other pets! But if the dog is okay with another, we may take in and adopt another. but the first dog would take priority.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* My partner and I are strictly childfree and don't foresee them interacting with children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\* We will be buying our first place! currently looking for a house with adequate indoor space for two people and a furry addition. We're also wanting to get a place with a small to medium back garden.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* We will be in Bergen, Norway. From google- the banned breeds are: \[Pitbull (American pit bull terrier), Amstaff (American Staffordshire terrier), Brazilian mastiff (Fila brasileiro), Dogo Argentino, Tosa inu / Japanese mastiff, Czechoslovakian Wolfdog.\]([https://thenorwayguide.com/banned-dog-breeds/](https://thenorwayguide.com/banned-dog-breeds/))

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* The warm season lasts for 3.2 months, from June 3 to September 9, with an average daily high temperature above 58¬∞F. The hottest month of the year in Bergen is July, with an average high of 63¬∞F and low of 51¬∞F. The cold season lasts for 4.2 months, from November 18 to March 24, with an average daily high temperature below 42¬∞F. The coldest month of the year in Bergen is February, with an average low of 29¬∞F and high of 37¬∞F.

I recently started Native Pet‚Äôs probiotic powder and that has helped with his digestive upsets after eating. Their allergy chews unfortunately have made no difference. His paws are now completely raw and developing sores, his lips and chin are discolored and bleed often from the scratching, and he‚Äôs recently developed hot spots on his inner front legs. I monitor him closely and don‚Äôt leave him unattended for long as to avoid needing to cone him. He‚Äôs such a sweet boy and I hate to see him so uncomfortable. My only other thoughts are an allergy test?

924,dogs,"So I have 2 puppy's about 19 days ago, the one which I WAS going to keep is grey-ish silver a female and the other one is a brown male. I got them from a stray dog that I give food to (In my country stray dogs and cats are very common) and their about I think a month old (bare with me people I wasn't really paying attention when the stray dog gave birth to the puppies) So the stray dog also lives with us because the puppies still need milk. 

So over the weeks it's been good the puppies are very active and play fight a lot... At least I think they where play fighting.So today when my dad told me to take out the trash because it was almost full we heard the puppies ""play fighting"" then it turned into the brown one yelping(?) and the grey-ish silver kept on bitting him. My dad tried to make her let go of him by hitting her on the but she still wouldn't let go so he had to kind of shake her of him and like get her to calm down. So for a few seconds she became calm but then she started attacking the brown puppy again,

So my dad hit her again she still wouldn't let go of the brown dog, so my dad just kept hitting her then swatting her away from the brown dog until she let go, then we put her in the corner, we placed a fold up table in her way so she wouldn't get out. 
BUT THEN, she slipped past the table and attacked the brown dog again.

 So we decided to put her (and the momma dog) outside, but the momma dog went somewhere and she started crying, so we put the brown puppy on the other side of the table and put the grey-ish silver nacl inside....so yeah my parents plan to get rid of her tomorrow (by get rid I mean give her to someone else not like...you know) and as for the brown one I don't really know, my mom already planed to give him to a neighbor, Thankfully blood wasn't involved just saliva.",t2_v6l03wmc,0,I think my puppy is crazy,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zudyj8,True,throwawaycrazypup2,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zudyj8/i_think_my_puppy_is_crazy/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zudyj8/i_think_my_puppy_is_crazy/,2474832,1671901601,0,,False,1671901612,1671901613,2022-12-24 17:06:41,,,,,,,

Recently my 2 dogs have started fighting with each other, to the point one is gonna get seriously hurt. My girl is 5, and has been giving my boy (2) warning signs that she does not want him in her space. A couple days ago she finally snapped at him, and in turn he full on attacked her. This has happened 2 times. Now, he seems like he‚Äôs forgotten and everything is cool. She on the other hand is very avoidant/anxious around him, even snarled a couple times.
I‚Äôve kept them pretty separated in different rooms for most of the last 24 hours; taking them out at different times and rotating attention between them. 
Should I keep them separated and work with them individually on some behavior modification? Or should I ‚Äúreunite‚Äù the pack and work with them together?

927,dogs,"So my family has 3 dogs but only the male dog is neutered. The two female dogs aren't spayed yet because we can't afford the cost. I'm from a third world country with a lot of neglected street dogs. We're not rich, but at least we can help some by giving them shelter and food so we got 3. However, vet expenses like spaying is another story since it's expensive. Anyway, back to the story, when one of the female dogs is in heat, she attacks the other female dog. They were biting each other, blood dripping from their ears and nose. It took three people to separate them and everyone was scared. That happened months ago. I thought that they will not fight again because none of them is currently in heat now. Earlier, the other gate of our house where my older female dog is staying was opened because she wants to hide. Our neighbors  are already lighting up their fireworks and she was probably scared hence her attempt to hide or find a way out of the gate. Because of this, the two female dogs met in one place and they started fighting again. It's really scary. They really want to kill each other. We managed to put them in separate places now but I'm really hoping that they'll be friends again. The two of them fighting is painful to witness. 

Is there any way to bring their friendly bond again aside from spaying? It all just started when one of them was in heat but up until now, they still don't like each other.

936,dogs,"Hi r/dogs,

We adopted a lab mix at 4 months old from a local shelter. We were told she's been brought from southern states shelters and that she was a lab-beagle mix, but as I understand it they didn't know her parents so this was just a guess on the part of the shelter.

We're not experienced dog people, but neither we nor more experienced friends really saw much beagle in her. Scouring the internet, she looked much closer to ""boradors"" (lab x border collie).

Photo album: https://imgur.com/a/gsSCU0i

I don't know how helpful her behaviour &amp; others traits can be, but some additional observations:
- Now at ~14 months, she's now about 42lbs.
- She doesn't shed much on the regular, outside of spring/fall change of coat.
- Her coat is rather short, shiny and waterproof. Her belly is bare.
- She has dewclaws.
- Her eyes are both brown.
- Her ears are pretty much always folder forward, she doesn't raise them or anything like that.
- She has a big white splotch on her chest, a bit of white on her chin and a few random white hairs here and there.
- She isn't bothered by rain or cold. With the current low temps in the US around -20C here, when I take her out to potty, without wearing any sort of jacket or booties, she wants to stay outside and play. She loves snow.
- She likes to chew and play ball.
- She loves nosework (lots of wildlife scent trails to follow around here) but isn't very good at it if we hide something for her to find (in fairness we haven't really trained her for it either).
- She's fairly active and likes long day hikes (haven't tried running with her yet outside of very short distances, we're waiting for her to be older).
- We haven't really observed any herding instincts.
- When following scents, she'll point.

940,dogs,"Hi! I have a ~14 months old lab-something mix (possibly lab-border collie, a bit under 45lbs). I'm trying to find something (some sort of indoor booties?) to cover her claws when visiting my parents.

I've searched the sub and mostly found things related to older dogs slipping and requiring more grip, or people being in rentals needing something long term (where the common answer seemed to be area rugs). That's not my case.

I visited my parents and stayed for a few days over the summer, when my dog was about 9 months. At that time, we had a really hard time trimming her claws and they were rather long. We've since got her (somewhat) used to it and can mostly keep them trimmed. 

My parents have cork floors, which are rather soft and fragile. So when I visited, with my dog's puppy energy, she left some scratches on these cork floors. They were also concerned about their leather couch. My parents said they were happy for me to bring her with me when I visit, but ask that she wears something to cover her claws. I expect my dog to wear something most of the day, but I'd remove them ""the solution"" when going outside or overnight. We're talking about something she'd wear every once in a while for a long weekend (2-4 days), not every day forever.

Some of their friends recommended PawZ Dog Boots, which kinda look like balloons, but... I'm not convinced? They look pretty terrible, not breathable, and some reviews mention circulation issues on their dogs' paws. Full outdoor booties don't seem great to wear for full days either. I've seen socks but many reviews are rather divided, with people often complaining they'll rotate, end up with the rubber traction coating on top, and thus be very slippery. I've seen rubber tips that get glued on claws, but as I'm very active with my dog (running, hiking, etc, including when I visit my parents) these don't seem like a good option either.

951,dogs,"Last Friday was the beginning of all this, I was playing with her like normal and she was running around happy as can be.. then suddenly she collapsed. I immediately checked if she was breathing and scooped her up in a panic. The feeling of her being completely limp in my arms was heartbreaking. I rushed to tell me wife in the next room was just happened. We laid her on the couch and she woke up and was back to normal, well acting like it at least. 

We took her to the emergency vet, they ran some tests, monitored her on an ekg but found nothing and sent us home. 2 days passed without incidents before the next one, this time she lost consciousness and was out for about 90 seconds. Back to the emergency vet again but again they found nothing. The recommended having an echocardiogram done but the easiest availability I was told was from a cardiologist vet 2 hours away next Thursday but they're calling the events Syncope. (this is still scheduled atm) At this point her breathing is noticeably shallow and rapid compared to normal, this has been getting worse each day now. 

We took her back home and the next day (this Wednesday ) she had another event.. out for 5 minutes this time. We contacted the vet but all the said was she needs to have the echocardiogram done asap but offered no availability anytime soon..

Early Friday morning around 2am she had yet another even longer event this time being out for 10 minutes in total while we were in transit back to the emergency vet. This time they finally said they would squeeze her echocardiogram the next morning and she stayed overnight. 

Result of the echocardiogram was severe pulmonary hypertension with no clear underlying cause, they prescribed sildenafil and said this should stop the episodes. She was OK all day but right before bed (she was already asleep) she had another episode this time unconscious for at least 10 minutes again. 

We feel so awful, we're back at the emergency vet again now, haven't slept all week and starting to feel like her time is almost up. It sucks though because aside from the episodes she'd been playful, eating and drinking normal and we have to calm her down because she wants to play so much. 

Thank you for those that read all this.

Adding some of her health records here, she is about 8 years old, adopted her at 4. has had history of seizures the last 2 years but they've been managed by phenobarbital and keppra. She has a glassy blue eye that we are unsure of the reason for.

959,dogs,"2 year old shihtzu poodle (male). He started peeing blood last Sunday, so we took him to the vet. They gave some medication to stop the bleeding and the next day he was diagnosed with urinal crystals (phosphate crystals) after checking his urine sample.

We have yet to do a blood test next week. We couldn't do it last time because he had just been vaccinated. The vet also wants to do something called kidney profiling (don't know what this is?).

He had no other symptoms other than the blood in his urine. He's currently on an antibiotic and some other medication. I was also told he can only eat royal canin urinary s/o moving forward. He's a picky eater and gets tired of food quick (was also diagnosed with pancreatitis a couple of months ago), so luckily he's been eating the food but I got some appetite stimulants just in case.

He's drinking more water than usual now and urinating more but it seems to be more of what he shouldve been doing? For example, he used to only finish his cup of water in a span of a day and a half and now he can finish the cup (about 350ml?), but Im making sure he drinks a little more than that as recommended by the vet.

Does anyone have any insights if this is something that could escalate to something worse or can I stop panicking and guess that this is probably something that's not so grave? What's kidney profiling and what's it for? Is there anything I should be looking out for?

I keep reading articles and stuff about kidney disease or bladder stones and it's starting to scare me.

Also noting that I work from home and have an extremely adaptable schedule (my bf is on campus for both school and work). We‚Äôre prioritizing a fenced-in backyard for our upcoming rental so I‚Äôm able to let the dog out easily.

Any tips for successful integration welcome ‚Äî FYI that I‚Äôm going to run any plans  through with my cat-specialist vet, who will be a major influence in our pet integration.",t2_t62o4ayg,0,Dog/Cat Intro,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zu54lu,True,ShelterEquivalent488,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zu54lu/dogcat_intro/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zu54lu/dogcat_intro/,2474726,1671868875,0,,False,1671868885,1671868886,2022-12-24 08:01:15,,,,,,,

I am shocked. My dog has always seemed to respect his place in our pack and never challenged me before, he is such a good boy, the most polite, sweet, dog I've ever had. I have zero tolerance for a dog that is a danger to my children. I have always felt so safe with him previously, I feel so betrayed. Realistically, what can I do? Is there a road back to trusting him?

They‚Äôve both become ‚Äúour dogs‚Äù and we love them both a lot. 

Hers is a Chiweenie (chihuahua and dachshund mix) named Beans. 

Long story short, my GF‚Äôs ex-husband was abusive to Beans and super rough and violent with him. Definitely has left Beans with some issues. He doesn‚Äôt love men and is a little cagey with strangers. Took him months to warm up to me but I feel like over the 2 years I‚Äôve known him he‚Äôs come to understand that I‚Äôm his friend and can be trusted. 

The only troublesome interactions I‚Äôve had with him have come around food. He snapped at me once when he was going for a cinnamon roll on the coffee table and I blocked him. He didn‚Äôt bite me but definitely flashed his teeth and growled and snapped at my hand. 

He can be a little unpredictable but has never bitten anyone. Has just been a bit growly around strangers in a handful of situations. 

Well, tonight my friend was over at the house. He has been around Beans a lot and Beans actually loves him. Beans is very excited to greet him when he comes to the house which is a bit rare for Beans. We had just brought dinner into the living room and the three of us were about to sit down. Beans was laying on the couch and my friend leaned down pretty casually to pet Beans. Beans launched up and bit him square in the face. 

It shocked all of us. It seemed completely out of nowhere. My friend had 3 pretty decent gashes on his upper lip that ended up getting him 3 stitches. 

My friend is being insanely kind about it and insists he just made a weird move or Beans was in a weird mood or scared somehow and it was just bad luck. We are physically sick to our stomachs we feel so bad about it. 

All of that is backstory to ask the question, what do we do now? Beans is 8 years old and never done this before. I thought we were making progress the last 2 years in rehabilitating him a bit from his past abuse he received. 

We feel like we now have to shutter Beans away if we ever have anyone in our home. Obviously we can‚Äôt have him near children ever again. He‚Äôs only 9 pounds but he did serious damage to an adult today. 

We plan to contact our vet and ask for advice. Is their behavior school that can help with an acute violent streak in a dog that seemed unprovoked? Do we need to buy him colored harnesses that show that he is aggressive? Does he need to be muzzled when he‚Äôs around anyone besides us? This is just uncharted waters we were totally unprepared for.

I‚Äôve kept them pretty separated in different rooms for most of the last 24 hours; taking them out at different times and rotating attention between them. 
Should I keep them separated and work with them individually on some behavior modification? Or should I ‚Äúreunite‚Äù the pack and work with them together?

Dogs are like their owners.

So many times the things ive said to my stubborn bastard dog i think this sounds familiar! (wouldn‚Äôt be without him!) 

Thats probably just learned behaviour ie i say whats been said to me growing up. 

He‚Äôs still young (13 months) and knows commands but will think about doing what he‚Äôs been told before doing so, or have to be told multiple times.

His recall when other dogs are around is shocking, he wants to play with them all and making me look like an asshole by having to shout at him is getting oldüòÇ. (Yes thats probably my fault not training him properly)

Im learning alot about myself since getting him and love it.
