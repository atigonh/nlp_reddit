0,dogs,"I have a 8 year old German shepherd and she is an amazing dog. I have had her since 8weeks and she knows all sorts of commands and is great at all of them, except for “stay”. I put her in sit then tell her to stay, and she will but the moment I go out of her eyesight she comes to me, she always immediately puts herself in a sit after but she won’t stay. If I stay where she can see me it’s fine but I’ve been having an issue with keeping her on her bed during dinners with my friend (she has a fear of big dogs due to being attacked when she was little), my dog leaves her alone for the most part because she will stay on her bed if we’re in the living room. But again the moment I move out of eye sight/ the dining room she follows. It’s not a begging issue, she will lay down and go to sleep, she just will not stay if she can’t see me. Is this something I can actually solve? My dad say’s because of her breed she is just trying to protect her person and I’ll probably never get her to listen.

1,dogs,"This morning I noticed my boy shaking, I thought he was cold so I turned up the heat. Still shaking.

When I told him to get off the bed so I could check him out her was hesitant.

I went to grab his right leg and he pulled away. 

My boyfriend picked him to get him off the bed and he whimpered.

I’m not too sure if he might have hurt himself coming down the stairs or off the bed but he seems to have hurt himself.

Nothing broken, we rubbed and massaged everywhere and nothing serious.

But he just shakes (almost like an anxiety shake) and struggles to get up the bed. He walks fine and doesn’t limp but I can tell he’s hurt.

I gave him a bit of his 300 mg doggo CBD and he’s relaxing. 

Only problem now is that no vets are open in my town. Even the local animal emergency room is closed for the next few days.

3,dogs,"I'm starting to get worried about my dog. She hasn't pooped in 3 days except a little last night. For some background, we have been hit with some really hard weather lately that doesn't seem to be letting up. All last week was snow &amp; blizzards. We got about a foot and a half. This week which started around late Monday night has been wind chills in the -40°F (-40°C) to -50°F (-45.5°C) and won't be in the positive degrees until Christmas Day around 3pm at the amazing temperature of 2°F (-16°C) which will unfortunately only last less than 12 hours before it goes back down to around -15°F (-26°C) for a few more days. 

All that said, we decided to not even try to take her out starting Tuesday. It was just too dangerous. She usually will use the pad if she needs to go. But she didn't on Tuesday or Wednesday. Last night I thought that maybe she thought she was being punished for not being able to go outside. I thought I was just show her the door &amp; snow and she would run back in, as usual to use the pad. We live in an apartment complex. As I was walking her down the hallway she started to go when she was walking and a piece came out (which happens normally when she really needs to go when we see in our way outside and don't get there in time). I showed her the door, and as usual it was too cold/snowy. However, her back right leg retracted (like went back up by her hip) and she started to limp the way back into the apartment. The doorway was about -15°F (-26°C) since we can't shut the door fully as it is frozen. She did not yelp or anything. 

Once I got her inside and she was warm, she was running around, playing, and everything was fine. She ate her treat. She ate her food. She drinks her water and urinates perfectly fine. She's always super cuddly and has been especially so. 

So I guess my question is, is it the stress of the weather that is making her not poop? I  guessing (or more hoping) it isn't a foreign object lodged in her stomach, as she was able to go a little earlier on our way out the door. I also am wondering if she might be having issues squatting to poop with her leg. I have given her half a baby aspirin as well and she seemed much better. 

I live in rural South Dakota. All (and I mean all) of our state highways and interstates are closed due to the snow and blizzards. Parts of our roads and state [still look like this](https://i.imgur.com/Vcc7rYD.jpg) as of this morning.

After 24 hours, I took her to the emergency vet who said nothing is wrong, she is just irritated. They gave me cream for the irritated area and an NSAID… they also drained her bladder… and she has to wear the cone.

 She seems a bit more comfortable now as she isn’t licking as incessantly if I take the cone off. But I cannot get her to go to the bathroom. I really don’t know what to do. She is eating normally and drinking water, although less water than usual. I’m so worried and of course everything will be closed here for the next 2 days for the holidays.

10,dogs,"Took my 13 year old dog yesterday to the vet and they told me she had oral melanoma which is cancer in the mouth? and advised me to put her down…I said no and asked to maybe postpone it for now to give me some time to think.

So here I am just stressing on what to do, I just want to get some feedback and help bc honestly she seems “fine” right now?, she runs, goes for walks, her breathing is fine and she does still eat too. I wanted to look into possible treatments or anything ? but I just don’t know where to start ? I can’t see myself putting her down without a fight. (That would be my last option)

I have been putting in some black seed oil in her food bc apparently that’s really good and I’m planning to go to another vet for a second option and possible get a surgery done? These are just some ideas but I would love to know what you think I should do.

She has been there and helped me through so many stressful and hard times and I believe I should do the same and fight for it.

35,dogs,"She's about 16 or 17. 

For the last few months she's been exhibiting some odd behaviors. 

For one thing she's a lot more active at night and sleeping most of the day. She used to literally wake me up to let her out but now I pretty much have to take her and she'll wait as late as 11 in the morning. She doesn't seem uncomfortable at all. She just sleeps.

She's become obsessed with licking her right leg after she gets a treat or some peanut butter. It'll go on a long time. She used to want to lick my hand afterwards but now she mostly ignores it and it's all about the leg. I've had it looked at and there's nothing wrong with it.

She gets pretty anxious and high strung, especially in the evening. Even so, her energy level isn't what it used to be. Sometimes she needs canine CBD to calm down. 

She's deaf and has been for a few years but it seems her normal behaviors from being deaf are somewhat amplified. Like she'll stand in the middle of a room and just ""zone out"" until you touch her. 

She's a lot more needy. Especially in the evening. She used to be pretty independent but she'll whine unless she's petted a lot. It's nice, but definitely different.

She's having some trouble with her back legs. Not a lot, but she's fallen a couple times. 

Even with all that she seems pretty happy over all and hasn't shown any major signs of maladjustment or unhappiness unless I'm reading things wrong. I've had her to the vet a handful of times and aside from her back legs, which she's on glucosamine chondroitin for, they say she's fairly physically healthy for her age.

48,dogs,"I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting:
I’m curious to know from people who own working breeds (specifically breeds where cropping is common: example: dobermans, cattle dogs, aussies, etc.) if your dog is cropped / docked and if you did it or the breeder did.  

I’m not personally against docking or cropping for dogs who work as I see the health and safety benefits it provides.  I am wondering though why dogs of these breeds who are only house pets still get these things done?  

It seems like, when it comes to dogs that are just going to be pets, it would just be an unnecessary cost to the breeder or owner.  

If you got it done for your pet: was there a reason? and do you regret it or do you not?
If you’re dog isn’t cropped or docked: why did you choose not to?

I have an AmStaff and every other AmStaff, APBT, and Staffy I see all have their ears cropped.  The Dobermans, aussies, etc. I see are all cropped / docked and they all just seem to be family pets?  

Again, I’m not against cropping or docking as I know there is a massive safety benefit for working dogs, but I just don’t see a reason to pay for it if you just have a family pet. 
So… what’s your thoughts?

I don’t want there to be any hate or meanness in the comments of this post.  If you’re against cropping or docking please be courteous and understand others points of view.

57,dogs,My dog ( female Siberian husky ) is almost 3 years old. Every time she falls asleep even if it’s for a few minutes she pees herself.

58,dogs,"Hi, for context; I have a 6 month old American Bully and he was neutered on December 8th. Surgery went great, no issues. They gave him dog ibuprofen for 4 days and a week later he started acting weird. He was shaking, crying and had really soft stools. I took him to my regular vet and they said he had some stomach cramps and they couldn’t really pinpoint what caused it. She said it could have been food related as I had started weaning him onto Purina sensitive stomach dry food (he had always had softer stools). 

The vet gave me metronitazole and told me to keep giving him the FortaFlora (probiotic) by Purina. She said he should feel better soon. Flash forward to the beginning of this week, he was crying more and more and I felt as though the medicine wasn’t working. I took him to the emergency vet as my regular vet suggested it because they couldn’t fit him in. I waited two hours and they told me that the anesthesia could have screwed up his GI tract. They gave me a different anti-diarrheal called Pro-Pectalin and Gabapentin for the pain. They also prescribed prescription “bland diet” wet food for 5-7 days and then I should wean him back to whatever food he was on prior (Purina Pro Plan puppy) as the sensitive stomach food may have disagreed with him. 

It has been a few days and I thought he was getting better but for the past two nights he has cried more than ever. He becomes lethargic and won’t even lift his head to look at me. This happens on and off during a 24 hour period. Then when he feels “better,” he acts normal. I cannot figure this out and it seems like the vets can’t either. I have been praying to whoever is listening and I feel so bad for him, I just want him to feel better. I miss my energetic, loving puppy. This is so not fair to him. I don’t know what more to do. If anyone has any advice, feel free to share and know it’s appreciated. 

Note: he had bloodwork two days before surgery and it was fine. His stool was also tested a week before the surgery and no parasites.

62,dogs,"I've been searching for standard poodle breeders and I've been successful in finding a wonderful breeder that does everything required. Their dogs are show dogs, they comply with all of the OFA requirements, and they make sure there's little relatedness in their pairings. Everything I've seen has been wonderful, but because they are show dog breeders and because of the AKC they follow the standards exactly and thus dock tails and remove dewclaws. I haven't read enough on the subject but generally have seen others stating that these procedures can be very harmful to the pup. I'm in a dilemma because health testing and longevity is the most important aspects to me, but at the same time I would like to not support these processes. I'm also looking for a slightly older pup which most likely will have these parts removed already. I'm worried that I'll be put in a place where that'd be my only option. I am willing to make a compromise but I feel guilty over that. Would I be doing the dog wrong by supporting that practice? How harmful can this be? I'd also take any breeder recommendations if anyone knows of breeders that match that level of quality but at the very least keep dewclaws (I can stand tail docking even though I don't prefer it).

69,dogs,"Hello, I’ve already brought my dog to the vet, but I just wanted to get some extra peace of mind since I’m already dealing with a loss in the family and am on edge.

My dog (a mutt rescued from Puerto Rico) was acting strange this morning. Restless, walking back and forth between the bedroom, couch, back door. Wanting to go outside a lot. 

I let her out about four times within like an hour and the last time she went out and just laid down in the dirt under a bush. Which she doesn’t do. The only time she likes to lay down outside is when the weather is nice and she can sunbathe.

When I let her in that last time she was panting, not labored or anything, but she was trembling like she was cold.

So, I rushed her to the vet and they examined her. No fever, gums, eyes, ears all look good. Heart and lungs sounded as they should. They said she had some discomfort in her lower spine cause she flinched when they examined her. So they gave her a steroid shot and gave me trazodone for her restlessness if it continues.

Now we’re home and after a few moments of wanting to go out or lay down under my desk,  she seems to have settled down and is finally  curled up sleeping on the couch.

So, my main point in making this post is to ask if other people’s dogs that have experienced pain have acted similar or not. She’s my first dog and I’ve never had to deal with her being in any type of pain. 

I also get very nervous about bloat since she is quite deep chested, but as far as I know she’s not really showing any signs of it, she’s drinking water, she ate breakfast in the morning and had a treat later on. No wretching or vomiting.

71,dogs,"I have a small dog who I walk 3-4 times a day. However, now that it’s cold she does not want to walk, she tries going straight back inside. My way around this is to carry her away from the house and then put her down, so she has to walk back home. Even with her thermal coat she comes back shivering though. 

I’ve tried putting puppy pads so she can go there and not hold it, but she refuses. She’ll just have accidents after HOURS of holding it. 

I saw the bark potty has pheromones and an outdoor smell that attracts dog’s instincts so I’m seriously debating on trying it out. Anyone have any experience using it?? I don’t want my pup to be suffering.

87,dogs,"My dog Schatze is a puppy rescue who has lived with us for 7 years. She is the definition of a spoiled little girl. She gets ice cream every weekend, she's super fat and extremely energetic and playful. She has never once shown any aggression towards a person or any dog, other than a few playful high pitched barks. Nothing angry or violent. 

Recently we rescued a 4yo GSD, Rudy, from a shelter and he is very skittish and aggresive towards our dog. He has a sore on his tail he has been chasing and biting so we are giving him pain killers, silver sulfadiazine cream, and covered the tail in bitter apple tape. This has stopped the biting but not the spinning. 

I figure it will be incredibly difficult to train him until he is no longer in pain but the anxiety is a huge problem that is keeping them from properly acclimating. Schatze is nothing but friendly and playful but he does not respond well to her whining when we don't let her play with him. 

We're currently installing a door to half the house and keep him from attacking her while we are away at work but we really need emergency dog training to get him a little more docile. 

If you have any recommendations for good teachers who can handle big dogs in the Philly area (he's totally friendly to people, after a minute of them being in the house, just not dogs) please comment! This could determine whether Rudy has to go back to the shelter (we have tried asking others to adopt him but no takers, he was on the kill list at the shelter so he's kind of like damaged goods, as unfair and inhumane as that is).",t2_tq3lq,0,Need a recommendation for a behaviorist in the Philly area that can socialize a rescue with a smaller house dog,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,ztj5ps,True,Matt1050,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/ztj5ps/need_a_recommendation_for_a_behaviorist_in_the/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ztj5ps/need_a_recommendation_for_a_behaviorist_in_the/,2474461,1671808926,0,,False,1671808940,1671808940,2022-12-23 15:22:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,dogs,"Just for a little background info, we got our dog Gigi I wanna say around 2017. Our neighbor came over one day and said that she found two dogs on the side of the highway one boy one girl and told us that we could keep one if we wanted to until she found them both a home. obviously we both just ended up keeping them permanently as we grew attached. We could tell that Gigi has had puppies before and was already fully housetrained and very timid and shy doesn’t really like to play with toys or really any type of games. She mostly just sleeps, and occasionally gets the zommies. We we thought that she might’ve been an older dog, but when we took her to the vet for the first time they claimed she was about 23. Soon after we got GG and she became accustomed to us and our household, my mom‘s boyfriend start coming around and this is the first time we saw her bark aggressively and sometimes even growl when he would try to pet her or even step near her. You can tell she’s very scared though because she will start shaking and even sometimes she will start urinating. She has never bit anyone the whole time we had her. When she barks at said person, she will do it from standing behind you with her tail between her legs. He has tried to give her treats relentless times and try to show her that he is not a threat but this has been going on for years and years on end and I can tell my mom is getting fed up. Honestly I don’t particularly care for the guy myself but I think I can confidently say that he has not done any harm to her whatsoever, so I’m not sure why she has this distain for him.
I think it’s also safe to add that She also barks at our next-door neighbor who looks like my mom’s boyfriend in the same skin, color and height.

90,dogs,"I am starting to think that there is something wrong with him psychologically. 

He's afraid of people, and as a result, he barks and lunges at them, but if they try to pet him, he would remain calm like a baby.

He doesn't know how to walk on a leash at 2 years old. I tried treats, clothes, petting, toys, and he just doesn't trust where he's going and just stops and freezes in the middle of nowhere.

He never learned how to get down from a couch or bed, so every time he jumps on either, I need to manually put him down.

If I'm about to go out, and if he was on my bed, for example, he would start SCREECHING like he's dying... So my neighbors definitely think the worst of me. 

He is aggressive whenever I try to brush him or clean his undereyes.... He definitely doesn't like either, and would bite me really hard as a result. Yesterday, I tried to tie my shoelaces, and he lunged at my face because he probably felt uncomdortable with me doing something over his head....

I am so helpless. One of my groomers even said that he thinks there is something seriously wrong with him. I give him everything, and he always gets what he wants. He is definitely spoiled, because I don't even yell at him. He learned what the word ""No"" means but that hardly matters when he suddenly reacts to something.

91,dogs,"My dog is such a b\*tch. She never gives kisses, never. 

My dog is a golden ""retriever"" who has never once played a game of fetch. 

My dog hates toys, she wants nothing to do with balls or rope or squeakers. 

My dog's version of playing is biting. 

When we go to the dog park, she walks the perimeter, ignores all other dogs, and goes up to the humans and demands that they pet her. 

Oh, my dog doesn't ask for things, she demands them. 

My dog doesn't really care for dog food, she'd rather eat from my plate. 

My dog had the cops called on her over 10 times because she just will not stop barking. 

My dog is the love of my entire life. 

My dog is now gone. I had to make the decision to put her down after 15 years. She was the most amazing dog, and I can't imagine getting another because they'd never be like her. She wasn't sick, but she was in immense pain. The vet came to our house, because my dog hated the vet's office so much that she'd try to bite everyone in sight. I was doubting myself every minute of the day waiting for the vet to come over, because I selfishly did not want to admit that it was time. When the vet gave her the anesthetic, she warned me ahead of time that most dogs react strongly because it gives a burning sensation, so don't worry when she reacts to the pain. That's when I realized the extent of her pain, because she didn't even flinch. I looked in her eyes as they closed for the very last time, and I knew that she understood everything happening. She laid her head in my lap, and then she died. 

My dog never gave kisses, ever. She never licked us, and I loved that about her. I don't like dogs that lick. 

My Golden Retriever never cared for games, or toys, but she had four ""babies"" aka stuffed animals that she nurtured and brought to me whenever I came home from being away. Most dogs tear apart the toys that their owners buy them. Her favorite baby, a pink bunny, she had for fifteen years, there's not a single hole in her, and I am holding her now as I write this. 

My Dog's version of playing was biting, I taught her how to play wrestle when she was a puppy and how to bite without actually biting because she needed a way to get her energy out but hated other games. If she came up to me and growled with her mouth open wide, it was play time. The best thing is, when her legs gave out and she couldn't stand well anymore, we could still ""play this game"" without her having to move an inch. 

My dog preferred human attention to animal attention, she was such a snob. But boy did she love attention, and she demanded it. And you know what? I was happy to give whatever she wanted. When she started to decline, she was perfectly comfortable demanding that I sit on the floor with her, help her walk outside, help her onto the bed. It was never a question of what she wanted, so I knew exactly how I could meet her needs. 

I keep leaving plates of food half touched, because I expect her to come by and finish. I need to re-learn to cook for one. 

My dog barked so much, that I will never forget how she sounded, and the exact cadence of her bark. 

After 15 years, my dog was the love of more than half of my life.

93,dogs,"If it matters at all, I'm 30f. I'm doing some stupidly last-minute Christmas shopping because I'm smart like that. We(mam and I) pulled into a parking space today at around 11ish and there's a car in front of is with the dog across the window in the back.

Immediately I'm fuming because WTF people?! I check to see if there's a window open(there is) but that's not bringing me a whole lot of comfort considering it's 7 bloody degrees out. The dog is very visibly shaking and curled up so that's just horrible to see. But we talk, and we figure some nice, sane person has popped into a shop for a second to get something really quick and couldn't bare to leave their beloved pet at home so, you know, car trip, woo!

Except we come back after 2ish hours because 1. People and 2. Crowds 3. People, so you know. THE DOG IS STILL FLUFFING THERE! By now, it's shaking so bad that I legit thought it was having a seizure at first. As soon as I approach the car it looks at me and tries to stand up, it kinda manages but pretty quickly flops back down, so I'm reach my quota on charitable thoughts about humans for the day, but my mam is nicer than me. So while  I stay outside fuming she goes into the store to see if either some moronic employee decided warmth isn't a necessity from 9-5 or someone got lost between the dog coats and checkoutfor (2+hours). They did not.

The employees are confused and annoyed and say they will keep on eye on him(to make sure they get TOD right? Ikr), but they also have a queue longer than my medical file.

Most of you probably hate me by now for not having called the guards or animal rescuers already, but there are two things holding me back: 1. Our local pound has the one of the highest kill rates in the country and the better shelters are further away 2. If the owner of this car is homeless, and the car is broken into, to get to the dog, they could both be in an even worse situation tonight.

So mam heads off for more shopping cause she doesn't hate people as much as I do and I decide to remove my coat, scarf, shoes/socks, gloves. Turn off the heating and the open my windows. I'm a wimp, this is not news, so I lasted 4 mins and 28secs.

I called the animal help people before I put back on my warmables. They are very unhappy, but they're also 2 hours away and its ""Christmas"" or whatever. This time my pause before calling the guards is much shorter and interrupted by my shivering. I call the non-emergency line, lady answers, I give her the details, the condensed version. She asks for the number plate, car description, dog details and she says she'll call the number registered to the car. And if that doesn't work, they'll send someone here.

The end of October brought some very bad news for our little family. Our 5.5 year old Boston terrier Huxley had a series of seizures and was ultimately diagnosed via MRI with an oligodendroglioma (right hemisphere, forebrain). No biopsy because deemed inoperable.

Since veterinary science and care in Sweden is abysmal (next to no treatment options aside from chemo, and out of the 3-4 vets/oncologist we met, only one actually showed empathy), we decided to do radiation therapy in Germany instead.

It was a 20-time protocol Mo-Fri for 4 weeks in nov-dec. We've been told about possible acute/long-term side-effects and survival, and in general were very well informed by the radiologists and vets at the clinic - but I wanted to see if anyone here had any experience with this.

We have had to do a lot of adjusting to make this work, being careful to keep baby safe. Aria lost her spot next to me, has to avoid the baby, and the baby wants to hang with her ssooo badly, but as I said, the baby is wild, so we can't have them hanging. The child has jumped on Arias tail, hit her in the face with a toy ukelele, jumped on her back, chased her...awful stuff. 

My poor doggie has lost so much, and been SO good.

Last week, during the two days the baby is thankfully gone, aria stole her little Llama toy (which the baby loves) and was playing with it, tossing it in the air, jumping.. I haven't seen her play since she was a pup , 7 years ago. She seemed to delight in the revenge. 

So, I let her have the toy the whole weekend. Sunday, I washed it, put it out of sight and never mentioned it to the baby (she'd lose her mind if she saw it and couldn't have it).

114,dogs,"So, a year and a half ago, I adopted a puppy from the shelter. She's an absolute love bug. She loves snuggles, kisses, and begs for pets. We are happy to give them to her and receive them from her. She's almost 2 years old; this behavior has started in the last six months or so. 

My mom, dad, and brother live next door to me but my dog, Meadow, is more of a family dog. During the day, my father takes care of my dog for company. She's still young, and although of indeterminate breed (aka a mutt!) she's obviously from a high energy stock. Unfortunately, she does have a permanent lameness in one leg which prohibits her from doing much running or other exhaustive exercise. We just keep her mentally active and we play with her a lot while she's on a bed so she can flop around and be active without having to run. In general, she's a happy, loved puppy.

All that said, in the past half year or so, she's exhibiting a new behavior behind which I cannot fathom the cause. I've tried to research this, but I feel like the results I'm getting aren't addressing my specific problem, but more just growling and snarling in general. Not always, but sometimes when my dad pets her, she growls and snarls at him. When he stops, she immediately begins begging for more attention, kisses his face, and wags her tail. If he starts petting her again, she will growl and snarl. This isn't ""love growling"" or ""dog purring"" or any of the other names I've read on various websites. Her mouth is not relaxed and her lip is curled up to show her teeth slightly, her tail stops wagging and her body gets kind of tense (although not ""I'm about to bite you"" tense), and she growls in warning. Once he stops petting her, as I said, Meadow will recommence wagging and move closer to him and beg for attention, even kissing his face. He avoids petting her lame leg, as do the rest of the family, because it sometimes hurts her, but it doesn't seem to matter where else he pets her -- she will still growl. And she doesn't do this to anyone else in the family except him. I mean, I clean her ears out, cut her nails, massage her lame leg, etc., and she never growls or snarls at me. Now, she *has* snarled at two other people (oddly enough, both of whom were extended family and had cancer/were going through chemo,) and she wouldn't even go near them, but stayed back to do her snarling. They never even pet her because she wasn't having it and we were not going to force her, of course. 

I've tried to tell my dad to just stop petting her the first time she growls. Just stop interacting to teach her that growling means the end of pets. But my dad is of the opinion it's a ""love growl"" because she keeps coming back for more pets. I'm afraid she's going to snap at him. 

While she does bark at strangers and the odd car going down the road (we live in a rural area with few visitors this far out, so she's not used to constant traffic), she's not much of a barker or growler otherwise as far as guarding goes. She is very, very vocal however. I mean, almost husky vocal. As if she thinks she's human and trying to talk to us. Yet, little of that is growling except when she's beating her up her toys by herself. 

I need some advice. I feel like it would be easier to teach the young dog new tricks than the ""old dog,"" because the ""old dog"" (dear old dad) won't listen!",t2_qd5ivrju,0,Why does my dog snarl and growl when begging for attention from my dad?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zt7n3i,True,shannon_dey,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zt7n3i/why_does_my_dog_snarl_and_growl_when_begging_for/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zt7n3i/why_does_my_dog_snarl_and_growl_when_begging_for/,2474356,1671774197,0,,False,1671774207,1671774208,2022-12-23 05:43:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

117,dogs,"Reddit is not allowing me to add a photo to this sub for some reason, but today, I went to PetSmart to buy my dog’s food. I have been feeding her Purina One True Instinct, and when I went to pick up a bag today, it was covered in what looked to be maggots…

This isn’t the first time this has happened either. The last time this happened, I bought a bag that looked perfectly fine. No worms on the outside of it and no damage to the bag whatsoever. 

However, when I took it home and opened it up to feed my dog, I looked in the bag and noticed the food was riddled with maggots (or some type or worm that looks very similar to them), dead spiders, bug eggs, dead moths and what looked to be spiderwebs. There was so many of those maggot-things that they started crawling out of the bag after it was opened. 

I immediately took the bag back to PetSmart and showed them the inside of the bag. They gave me a refund and informed me that there really wasn’t much that they could do aside from that, as it has to do with Purina. 

So I called Purina and told them of what happened. They told me how apparently because the food is cooked at such high temperatures, that nothing parasitic could be in the bag. They then issued me coupons and that was the end of it. 

Honestly, I was pretty upset by this considering it can’t be good for my dog to be eating that, and I worry other people’s dogs will be in the same predicament and could get sick. Now today, I found yet another bag of it covered in those worm things. I do have a photo, but Reddit won’t let me post it here.

120,dogs,"I was giving my dog belly rubs an hour ago and noticed a bunch of big black circles on his body, and as I looked closer I thought they were ticks, but I am not 100% sure.  After doing more research, I don't think they are ticks, I find it very unlikely for 5 ticks to all be perfectly attached to his nipples (there is dried blood around them too).  They are also not floppy like only the head is attached, they seem more like scabs which are attached to the skin on all sides.  He has a few other scabs it looks like around his nether regions too.

With this cold front blowing in yesterday, we had a high of -5 degrees today with quite a bit of snow, and we did spend about 5 to 10 minutes outside.  After running around in the snow for about 5 minutes he started limping and I noticed he didn't put any weight on one of his back legs, so I immediately picked him up and took him inside and warmed him up.

121,dogs,"Hi Folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some advice on what to do about a recent incident with my dog.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a 3 year old mix that we got as a puppy (Embark results told us she is 1/2 Aussie, 1/4 Bichon Frisse, 1/4 Cavalier King Charles). This evening we had some family over for dinner, and the evening ended with our dog biting my 6 year old cousin as they were leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

The bite was not significant - a tiny drop of blood with no punctures, mostly just scary for everyone, but I am very worried about what it might mean going forward. I will not have this happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

To lay out the scenario, my cousin loves dogs and has one at home who loves to cuddle her. She had been playing with my dog this evening, and I could tell it was too much for my dog a few times so I intervened. On this last occasion, my cousin tried to give my dog a goodbye hug, and she reacted by biting her. I could tell my dog was scared, but I was distracted because we were in the middle of goodbyes and I wasn't able to react in time. It happened very quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I am furious with myself for not just putting the dog upstairs earlier, but now I have to decide what to do going forwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more context - I have a 2 year old child and a 9 month old. My dog has never been aggressive with them or other humans (including an incident where my son fell on top of her). They also aren't very interested in her though, and almost never get up in her face the way my cousin did tonight. I know I can't count on them basically ignoring her forever though.

&amp;#x200B;

The dog does have resource guarding behavior with other dogs, which has escalated to the point of my Aunt's dog not being able to visit anymore because my dog will attack her over crumbs, toys, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am just saddened and overwhelmed. I almost can't look at my dog without crying with worry. I just don't know how this ends without me trying to find her a new home.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I am considered doing.

&amp;#x200B;

• Putting her upstairs whenever we have kids visiting.

• Hiring a dog behaviorial trainer - I don't know if this is the kind of thing they can help with though, or how to evaluate whether the trainer is qualified.

• Rehoming my dog - I can't have a dog that I don't trust around my children.

&amp;#x200B;

What else can I do? My dog is basically my favorite person in the world but my kids come first. 99% of the time I am on top of things, but I will be distracted again.",t2_32wzj,0,Help - my dog bit a child,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zt60r6,True,MoaRider,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zt60r6/help_my_dog_bit_a_child/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zt60r6/help_my_dog_bit_a_child/,2474342,1671768636,0,,False,1671768647,1671768648,2022-12-23 04:10:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

124,dogs,"So, I currently have two older GSD mixes plus an 8 month old medium-breed puppy. I have a long history of rescuing and fostering but I usually only take in older, calm dogs.

A family friend is going through a family emergency and is currently staying at a hospital with her son in the ICU. They have asked for help with their dog, a 1 year old pit bull. They would like someone to temporarily foster the dog until the mother is able to go home and resume normal life. So, we would just be holding onto the dog until the family can take him back, not trying to rehome him. 

I'm told the pit is good with other dogs and cats (I also have cats), and lives with an ancient chihuahua.

However, the pit is not yet neutered, and neither is my 8 month old puppy. Both are males. I'm not sure why the pit isn't neutered, though I'm guessing they're waiting until he's fully mature, as that seems to be the trend. My puppy is a show dog and won't be neutered prior to 2 years unless there is a medical/behavioral need. 

On one hand, I've been wanting to foster another young dog to play with my puppy, as my older dogs get tired pretty quickly. 

On the other hand, I've had some bad experiences with dog vs dog aggression and I'm still a little traumatized. A family member had a pit who attacked my male GSDx repeatedly a couple years ago. When I think about my dog meeting a pit I just picture their last fight, when the pit wouldn't let go of him. I know that's not fair, as there's plenty of pits who are nice. 

I want to help the family out, and I want to give the dog a chance. Having two intact males is making me more nervous, though. If I try this, am I setting these dogs up for failure? My pup is young and happy and innocent. If he has a bad experience I'm worried it will follow him for life. He's supposed to be a show/sport dog, so I absolutely can't have him bring reactive or aggressive. 

They wouldn't ever be unsupervised together, and the foster would be crated when I'm not home.

129,dogs,"My precious little shiba inu, young and otherwise healthy, was diagnosed with lymphoma about a month ago. I was absolutely gutted. He was a stray who found me in a time of need, like a little angel. I love him more than anything. When we got the diagnosis, we decided to do whatever we could to give him the highest quantity of quality time. 

We are giving him prednisone... They wanted to wean him off of it during the CHOP chemo, but he just does so badly without it. The prednisone makes him want to eat, which is necessary, because he lost a lot of weight when we were searching for a diagnosis. 

CHOP seems to be really hard on him. He has thrown up and doesn't want to eat. He LOVES walks, but due to the freezing temps, he can't go outside for more than a couple minutes now. He just seems so out of it.  

This usually is the case for about 2-3 days after each treatment. Then, he bounces back, but... He gets chemo every week. He's almost to the end of the first round of CHOP (4/5 weeks I think)

I guess I'm asking if anyone else had a dog who struggled with the CHOP treatment and still got into remission? Of course I don't want to prolong suffering, but he's so young. If we could get him into remission and have a year or so more with him, it would be all worth it. But it's just hard seeing him look so bad when most dogs don't seem to react negatively to CHOP... I just pray that we can get through the treatment and he will be himself again, for as long as he can be.

134,dogs,"My neighbor reported me to animal control for felling my dog sleep outside in the cold.

For context it’s 20-26 degrees Farenheight in Seattle right now, colder than usual. Sammy is an Anatolian Shepard Afghan hound mix and deals with cold extremely well. In fact I’ve only seen him cold once. He sometimes sleeps outside all night by choice. Yesterday night I didn’t let him sleep outside because it was ridiculously cold. But to even get him to come inside I had to tip his bed on his side to get him to get up and come inside. A standard occurrence because he loves sleeping outside. 

My neighbor meant well, but should definitely have talked to the owner before just calling animal control.

We have a 12 yo English bulldog. She is not doing great and slowly getting worse. She gets constant skin and ear infections and has had 4 tooth abscess since May.

147,dogs,"I have a roommate named Jane (20F). She moved in with us last year when her previous living situation was no longer healthy for her. 

Jane has a whole host of mental and physical illnesses. She has a therapist she’s been seeing for over a years honestly I’ve not noticed a difference in her behavior in the last year. She spends most of her time locked up in her room, only leaving for work and misting getting takeout for meals. 

Here’s where I have a concern. With Jane came a lovely rescue dog that she has registered as an ESA. He is an absolute angel and is very well behaved. Jane only lets him out every 24 hours, Jane never lets him outside of her room. When they do leave the room it’s for his potty time (3 to 5 minutes outdoors). 

Jane is a nice girl, and I fully sympathize with struggling mental health. But in my mind that does not excuse keeping an animal you cannot take care of. It’s gotten to the point that I’m wondering if I should report animal abuse because it’s just not fair for him to only get to go potty once a day and spend max 10 minutes outside of the same four walls. From what I’m viewing this good boy is only creating additional mental exhaustion to my roommate and is not providing relief. 

Granted I never know what’s going on behind closed doors. But I’m lucky enough to be working from home with my own pup so I know when she letting her dog out. I have offered to let him out mid-day while she’s at work but she has declined. I just don’t know what to do and would love some advise.

148,dogs,"I have a 3yo lab/hound that I've been fostering for 3 weeks.  He's high energy and very jumpy and mouthy, but otherwise a good confident doggo.  When I met with the shelter they said he was good with other dogs, but because it's a foster he shouldn't really interact with dogs without proper supervision.  He's excited to see other people and dogs, but does lunge and occasionally barks at dogs, but I've never seen anything I'd consider aggressive.  Because I was told  he was good with other dogs, I just excused it as he was frustrated because he wanted to play but couldn't, but had an incident today that gives me pause.  

Another foster parent was going out of town for the holidays and wanted a temporary place for a HW+ pup to recover rather than going back to the shelter so I volunteered.  I brought my foster to the shelter and we let them meet.  Mine was playful, but the new boy wasn't really interested.  Eventually mine just did his normal wandering around and sniffing.  Got  them in the car,  mine barked a few times but eventually just started staring out the windows.  My plan was to walk them in the backyard before going inside, but didn't get that far.  Got mine out first because he's a handful and while I was getting out the new guy mine went right at him, and it wasn't playful.  Managed to get the small guy away, but mine was trying to go thru me to get to him and got me pretty good on my hand.  No injuries to the pup, thank goodness, but it was very disconcerting so I ended it right there.  

but he went after this dog unprovoked just getting out the car.  Could it just be some leash frustration, or could it be a form of actual aggression?   Or did I just screw up by having one in leash trying to get the other one out the car?  I'm trying to get him adopted, but I don't want a return if he does have some aggressive tendencies.

Her teeth were as clean as if I brushed them regularly and when I brought her in for a cleaning when she was 10, our vet said that they looked like the teeth of a much younger dog. I thought I was doing great things for my girl.

Today, I found out how wrong I was. She developed a bump on her face, which turned out to be an abscessed tooth that needed to be removed. While she was under anesthesia for the procedure, the vet informed me that almost all of her teeth are fractured and two additional teeth needed to be removed.

I learned today that I should have switched her to softer chews a long time ago. I feel so bad for causing her so much pain. She didn't show any signs of not wanting to chew, but I can only imagine how much she's been hurting when she does.

162,dogs,"Yes, shocking I know. My 2yr labXgolden has the endless stomach of all labs.

A little context on her. I raised her for a service dog program but she was released due to hip dysplasia, so I adopted her back. Because of the condition, I keep her on the skinny side to preserve her hips as long as possible. I only feed her from The Farmer's Dog and all treats are from them or normal 'produce' (i.e., carrots and bananas are the two favourites, of course limited for sugar), so this gal eats well! I spend more on her and my cat's food than my own groceries 😂 who cares about my health! 

When I was training her for the SD program, obviously there were lots of rules in place and things I had to teach her. So she was on a busy schedule of constant outings and trainings. As a typical puppy, and a lab on top, she would try and eat anything but I trained it out of her. Fast forward to after her release from the program and now she's lost a lot of the rigid training, as expected. I'm not on a time crunch to train her anymore and I was dealing with hella mental health problems during grad school. I've picked the training back up to almost daily sessions again, but I'm struggling alone to come up with new things to teach her (it's a little nuts how quickly she picks new commands up). I'm hoping once I graduate next summer and move into a more permanent life stage, I'll find a good trainer/program for her to keep her mind busy. 

So the issue! I mentioned she used to eat everything but I trained it out, well since she's returned to me, she started picking things up off the ground on walks (quickly nipped that one) and for a short time would eat dog poop my apartment neighbours never pick up (also got her to stop this). However, the main issue is her eating cat poop/litter and bird seed/etc. From the backyard. I'm visiting my parents for the holidays, so these are appearing here because I don't have a backyard (so she's not out alone unsupervised normally) and my litterbox has a cover but my parents' boxes don't. Its not a situational behaviour because I know she'd keep doing this if given the opportunity no matter what lol

My wonder is, how can I correct her on these behaviours? I know the obvious answer is don't leave her unsupervised, but not only is that unrealistic for daily life, but this is legit her only bad behaviour. More stimulation is also always an answer, but hope I covered that earlier. And prevention isn't actually solving the issue... I want to teach her that just because I'm not there to say no, doesn't mean that it's acceptable to eat it. I kind of mentioned earlier she's a smart girl, and she's got sass too, so I'm almost certain she KNOWS she's not supposed to eat these things but just doesn't care.

163,dogs,"So I started dog sitting for this family. They have to doodles where one is a little over a year old now and extremely high maintenance in the attention he needs. I’ve dog sat for this family for awhile now and even stayed at their house for two weeks straight while they were away. Problem is, I don’t think I’m charging enough and it’s starting to feel problematic for me.

First off, when I go on a trip and I can’t take my dog I take her to a kennel which is $40/night. She in no way received the love, attention and care I give to said clients dogs. 

Secondly, I am expected to sleep over and take the dogs on 2-3 walks a day. My most recent visit included me staying at the family’s house with their youngest daughter (she’s 13) and their two dogs and the family still only paid me $50/night. I was practically babysitting as their daughter took up a lot of my time that would’ve been used differently if she wasn’t there. Furthermore, I was asked to stay from 6pm Thursday night to 9pm Monday night and they said they were going to pay me for 4 nights but then called that Sunday confirming they were only paying me for 3 days and I said 4 so then they just asked me to leave Monday morning so they could just charge me for 3 nights or $150 total.

I’m posting this because they’re asking for my help again, to watch their dogs and stay with there daughter for 3 nights next month and then come in February to stay 10 days with their two dogs while they’re away.

166,dogs,"Sorry if this isn’t the correct place for this, if not please delete and point me in the right direction, thanks.


So… a few months ago we moved into our new home. One of our neighbors on the side has a Husky that is pretty much left outside the majority of the time. Whether it was hot, or now that it’s cold, pouring rain, this dog is normally left on it’s own outside with no shelter from the elements. 


We are constantly woken up, including our 16 month old, by this poor dog’s howls for attention. In the few months we have lived here, it has also gotten off its lead (their yard isn’t fenced) and gone missing for hours to days at a time. One of the times, I opened my door to find him on the other side ready to help himself in. He’s sweet, and we were able to walk him back over and return him. 


When I knocked, I heard yipping from another dog, and there was some small breed (can’t remember the type, probably a shitzu or something similar) that was inside the home. We had never even seen or heard this dog before this. So it’s not like they just don’t want an animal in their home. They just don’t let this husky in it.


The most recent time he escaped, my wife noticed a post in a Facebook group for missing animals in our area that was of a husky that looked very similar to our neighbors. We hadn’t seen or heard him, so my wife went over to ask if their dog was missing. The person’s response was not what you would expect from someone who cared about their missing animal. The guy said it was his brother’s and when my wife asked if they wanted the dog back, he just kind of shrugged and said not really. They eventually got the dog back and he’s tied up again outside with no shelter.


We live in the south, and I’m well aware this breed is meant for arctic temperatures, but he just looks so lonely and miserable tied up out there. And this week is supposed to be the coldest it’s been in years. I’m hesitant to call animal control or report them, since that means the dog ends up in a shelter.

He had been going through several medical complications and the latest one was bladder stones. He had a scheduled surgery to get the stones removed yesterday however his health declined drastically within the last two days leading up to yesterdays surgery.  I took him in early yesterday morning and I broke down crying there at the vet as I was dropping him off. I just knew in my heart that my best friends time on this Earth was coming to an end. 
The night before surgery I took him out to pee, and usually he goes quickly and comes right back inside. This time however he just stared at me from his spot on the grass then would look in the sky and sniff the air. I kept calling him to come in bc it was freezing but he would not move. I feel he was trying to tell me, ‘mom it’s my time. Please let me go now.’ 
I didn’t sleep the  night before vet visit bc I was terrified he wouldn’t live to make it to his appointment yesterday morning. I eventually got a call from the vet letting me know about the blood work results and he laid out all my options. None of the options were good.

Hi! My 11-month-old cavapoo pup (fully vaccinated!) has been dealing with what we/our vet believe is kennel cough for almost three weeks. Once he started doing the classic kennel cough “honk” a few times a day, my partner and I immediately took him to our vet, who said they believe he has kennel cough. His temperature was normal, and his cough was (and still is) really his only symptom — he is sleeping, eating, drinking, and playing normally, and there’s no visible discharge or runny nose. 

They prescribed him a cough suppressant to help relieve the cough at night especially. Since then, we’ve been diligent with his cough suppressant and have been sticking him in the bathroom with us twice a day and running the shower to create steam. We’ve also tried giving him a tiny bit of honey in warm water and running a humidifier basically all day every day. It’s cold, so we’re definitely keep him inside and as warm as possible, too. 

Around the two week mark, the cough lessened to only once or twice a day, almost always at night or in the morning right when he wakes up. Now, we’re pushing on three weeks, and today — after moving his crate into a warmer room of the house — the cough seems to be picking up steam again. We can’t tell if this is good since he’s potentially expelling more bacteria and breaking up phlegm, or if this means he’s getting worse. Is it normal for kennel cough to linger in this long — and to start getting worse after we thought it was potentially getting better? 

We’re running out of options, the vet still seems relatively unconcerned, and we’re just worried this may be developing into something more serious. We’ve ask to start him on antibiotics today to see if that helps. Appreciate any advice or similar experiences others have had!!",t2_mgg59uyq,0,11mo Cavapoo Can’t Seem To Shake Kennel Cough,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zstp63,True,alwaysconfused1028,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zstp63/11mo_cavapoo_cant_seem_to_shake_kennel_cough/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zstp63/11mo_cavapoo_cant_seem_to_shake_kennel_cough/,2474182,1671735100,0,,False,1671735112,1671735113,2022-12-22 18:51:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

197,dogs,"Hi everyone.  
I have three dogs, 2 males and and a female that I’m currently fostering.  I live with my parents and sister. Tony is my my sisters dog and Vito is mine.

Tony (mix breed) is 4 years old and Vito (German Shepherd) will turn two in may. Neither have been neutered. Tony is a small dog, about half the size of my German Shepherd and tends to bite when he’s afraid or feels cornered. He was traumatised as a pup when a shitty vet did a terrible job with his grooming and ended up hurting him. Since then, he’s bitten me one (when I was trying to give him a bath) and my sister twice (she was hugging him and he probably felt like he was in danger).

Vito had a canine distemper as a pup, and I had to nurse him for 3 months until he got better (most vets told me he had a very slim chance of surviving). Vito was bullied by Tony a lot as a pup because he was weak and easily frightened. Eventually Vito and Tony started getting along better but about a few weeks ago, Vito started showing signs of aggression towards Tony. 3 days ago, Vito attacked Tony when he came to me for pets. He bit him and lifted him in the air, and I basically had to pull Vito back and shake until he let go. 

Now I’ve been advocating for Tony to get neutered since he turned 1, but my parents baby him and have been too afraid to go through with it. I’ve always planned to get Vito neutered, but I wanted him to be fully grown before I go through with it. I believe that Vitos growth was stunted due to the distemper. His ears didn’t start standing until 7 months, his size didn’t change at the right age and even now he’s tall but still on the skinny side. 

Ever since the incident, my parents have been asking me to get Vito neutered but I’ve been hesitant. I’ve asked them to give him a few more months and to get Tony fixed right now. I’ll keep the two in separate areas ( Tony is mostly inside, Vito spends most of his time outside since we have a really big lawn) and when Vito gets a little closer to two I’ll get him fixed too. Am I being irrational here? I just really don’t want to put my boy through it until I’m sure he’s done growing.

198,dogs,"Hi all

I live in the suburbs in a new build neighborhood which two sister neighborhoods share a common space by the retention pond. For the 1.5 years I’ve lived here, my neighbors and I have shared this common space without issue. I and some of my other neighbors take our dogs out there to play fetch and run around. I have a 70lb mutt who I take out there to play. 

A new neighbor, I will call S, moved into their recently built house a couple months ago. S has a ~170lb bull mastiff/Great Dane mix and a 80lb German shepherd. S let’s his dogs run loose in the common area and poop where they please. The problem I have with this is he doesn’t pick up the poop and his dogs seem untrained/uncared for. 

This neighbor does not have a fence and seemingly has a carefree attitude to his dogs roaming his backyard which connects to the common space as he does not normally watch them. S lets them out of his house through the garage and then disappears back into his home while his dogs drop elephant sized poops in the common space. My neighbors and I have all stepped in poop at least once and the common area is now a minefield. As you might expect we are upset and want him to pick up the poop. 

My wife wrote a note in a friendly tone crafted to not accuse him or make S feel bad requesting that he please pick up his dogs poop so we can all enjoy the common space. This note fell on deaf ears unfortunately and after 3 weeks my wife went out into the common space, picked up all of the dog poop, and left it at the edge of his yard. 

S did not appreciate this and has been letting his dogs loose while our neighbors and I are out with our dogs in the common space. They continue to poop where the please and S has become aggressive. 

What can we do? Is this worth fighting?

After they got done eating I gave the boy chihuahua a small ball as I was cleaning the girls faces off.

207,dogs,"I am hosting a foster dog, and I am at my wits end trying to get her to toilet outside. Any advice appreciated. 

TLDR; Very nervous pupper, will not toilet outside, will not accept treats when outside, and goes for long periods without toileting at all. 

Context: She is about 1.5 years old, found in Ukraine. She is spayed. She was adopted once before, and during that time, she lived outside as a farm dog. She killed their barn cats and chickens, so they surrendered her back to the shelter. 

I was told she was house broken - this was not true, and I don't think she has ever lived inside. She is also very nervous and afraid of just about everything. She's started to trust me and is comfortable in my apartment, but outside is definitely a stressful experience for her. My apartment sadly has no private yard. I also have a dog, and they get along. My dog often walks with her, but not always.

Problem: I have had her for 5 days now, and she has never peed or pooped outside. She has had accidents inside, but this isn't a big problem - I understand that it will take time to house break her.

The bigger issue is that instead of toileting outside or inside, she often just doesn't go at all. Like 24+ hours between accidents inside. I'm concerned about the negative effects of this. I am also concerned that her stress level is so high that she can't relive herself. She also refuses any food when outside but eating just fine inside. 

This is my current walking schedule with her: 
- 90 mins first thing in the morning before breakfast (6am when it's still relatively quiet outside)
- 60 mins at lunch, often with a stop at the dog park where she can run without me holding the leash
-60 mins in the evening about an hour after she eats
-30 mins walk after 10pm when it's quiet again
-Plus, short trips outside whenever she seems to be giving signals that she needs to pee/poop

I work from home with a flexible schedule, and that's why I'm able to walk her so much, but this is not sustainable in the long term. We also walk along a local creek far from any roads, and it is usually quiet except for other dog walkers. We do cross a busy road to get to this creek, which is unavoidable as my apartment building exits right to it. 

I'm not sure what else I can do to help her. I am using a long training leash sometimes so that she can walk farther away from me, but so far, this hasn't helped either.

Is there anything else I could be doing? Or is this just a waiting game? Anyone else experience something similar?

I want a friend who could company me during exercises too so I would really like to know if a Shih Tzu can walk with me for 1 hour or so (everybody says smt different so I'm unsure what the answer is)

Also, I would like to accustom this little guy to pee/poo outside but I think they are more of a pee inside dogs?

213,dogs,"so both my babies are pups from my dog i got about 11 years ago. she died a few months ago. when my female dog, peewee, was born i ofc raised her &amp; trained her took her everywhere w me etc. my male dog, chance, we didn't know mama was pregnant &amp; his batch was a big surprise when we found a pup layin on the couch 🥹 i also raised &amp; trained him. 

they're were always around me which isn't abnormal. i'm 2019 i moved into an apartment w my bf &amp; tried to bring my dogs but felt they were unhappy so i left them w my dad &amp; mama doggie. i didn't see them v frequently every month or every few months &amp; they'd be ecstatic the whole time 💕 my life has changed drastically  in the past 10 months &amp; im living at home again on the couch w no personal space. 

so chance he's v cuddly &amp; he follows me but he sleeps more on his own &amp; wanders but is still connected &amp; follows me more than anyone else. peewee i mean she follows me every where i go to the bathroom, where she waits outside the door. everytime i get off the couch just anywhere i go. &amp; when i sit on a recliner she has to jump up &amp; be there w me. if i move to another chair she follows me. she stares at me constantly. since i'm on the couch i don't have a lot of room &amp; she cuddles right next to me either by my stomach or the crevice between my legs. i love it 97% of the time. but sometimes i'm like omg why are u always up my ass. lol. i believe she has anxiety/separation anxiety so i think maybe that has something to do w it? my dad will call her &amp; she will not go to him or listen to him. but if i call her she's right there in seconds. she listens to me dad bug really only listens to me the most, unless my dad speaks to her authoritatively. 

i love the relationship w my babies &amp; i wouldn't change it ever. i think they're here for a short time &amp; deserve to be spoiled &amp; sleep w you car rides etc. but am just wondering why she won't leave my side or go somewhere else or to another person really? like she goes potty &amp; eats w out me ofc but any other time she has to be w me. &amp; if i tell her no she can't sit w me she sits &amp; stares at me or lays at my feet til i get up. she got mad at me last night when i wanted 5 minutes of space on the couch w out being crowded &amp; she was on the chair next to me, &amp; she just turned &amp; faced away from me like she was mad 🤣

215,dogs,"Sorry, I am furious still and have to vent.

Today I was at my local farmers market. I live in a small village and almost everyone has a dog. I was queing for the butcher and in front of me was an adorable elderly golden retriever who had the time of his life sniffing. He was with his owner, an elderly lady which did look a little scruffy (sorry, english isn't my first language and I do not mean this in an offensive way). The dog was on a leash, but the owner did not hold onto it as the dog was staying and she was paying her meat. 

The dog went to the women next to him (having a K\*ren haircut) and sniffed (did not sniff the women or begged or anything). The women turned to the dog and said: ""Stop it. I already gave you a piece of sausage at the other stand. This is enough."". I was confused and so was the owner! She asked the women if she really gave her dog meat without asking. She told her her dog was old and sick and could not eat any sausage. He just was in the hospital last week.

Can you believe it? And instead of apologising this women told her, that the dog was begging and she should not have brought him to the market if he couldn't behave! The women next to her even agreed with her! I was speechless and so was the owner. The poor women told her, she usually doesn't bring her dog but as he was unwell this was an exception. When she turned to leave, I had to speak up and told her I thought this was not right and she was happy someone felt the same way. This evil women turned around and told me that she had a dog as well, but he could behave. I said that this has nothing to do with it and that she could not feed any animals as they could not decide for themselves. You wouldn't just give children food without permission from their parents then why would you fed animals. She just repeated that she knows dogs and that this was a misbehaved dog. I glared but could not say anymore as I was next in line.

At home I'm still fuming. I don't know what I would have done if anyone fed my dog without asking me. And the poor elderly lady was gaslit and felt bad. I really hope the dog is okay!

Has something like this ever happen to you? Would you fed a dog who isn't yours?

Sorry, but I had to vent.

217,dogs,"I already have 2 rescue dogs. My female labrador gets along perfectly with the rescue puppy. My male staffy is a bit dog aggressive/reactive. He is neutered. This rescue puppy is male, still needs to be neutered, estimated to be 6-7 months. He's very friendly. Last night this puppy ran up to the house gate and my staffy was aggressive and lunged to bite. I've since done a formal introduction and my staffy was surprisingly good with my supervision. However he tenses up with the death stare, starts lip licking and gets ready to lunge but I'm able to snap him out of it. I've carried the puppy right up to my staffy and my staffy sniffs him but is quite intense and softly bit at the puppy which I corrected. My staffy then just looked away and showed avoidance which I think means he's just avoiding the interaction. Even with the puppy close by to my staffy, I'm able to get my staffy to sit, lay down and relax a little. All rescue organizations are full and there are no available foster homes for the puppy. My mums friend can take him in but I'm not sure if he'll be a good match because her dog always escapes the yard and is a small dog, so this puppy will probably do the same and being a stray he may just run away as I don't see her giving him proper leadership. I'm lost for options other than keeping him. I have videos of my staffy and him meeting but I can't post it here.

219,dogs,"Ok I will catch major hate for this…

Leash laws in general are good. However, the problem becomes when people are convinced that all dogs can benefit only from being on leash &amp; a walk is good enough. 

However, there needs to be wide open spaces that allow for dogs that are trained off leash to run. Certain breeds it is within their breed standards that they need to run off leash everyday.

That doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t train their dogs prior to going off leash. In fact, to do it correctly you have to keep reinforcing the behavior of coming when called in so many situations. 

I feel like if you get one of these breeds you have lots of recall training in your future. But to make all open space as on leash, can lead to the detriment of certain breeds. 

If an area is known as off leash dog play- then people shouldn’t bring their highly reactive dogs on leash… similar to dog parks…

220,dogs,"My parents were not good dog owners. Near the beginning of the pandemic, my mother got a pair of dogs from a breeder in order to ease the burden of loneliness or some such thing. Within about a year or two, it became clear that my mother only saw them as a distraction that she'd quickly grown bored of and that boredom soon turned to neglect and neglect to active abuse of the pair. I ended up putting my foot down, took the dogs off her hands, and moved out. I'm not exactly a dog person by any means and really had no intention on ever getting a dog, but the pair loved me and deserved better than what they were getting.

It's been a year or so since, and I find that my specific work and living situation just isn't super conducive to properly looking after two dogs, and one of the siblings hasn't adjusted well at all to living in a place without an immediately accessible yard. Furthermore, in about 6 months, I found out that I literally will not be able to have *two* dogs living with me. I feel like garbage, but I'm self aware enough to know that I need to do *something*. Trying to give myself proper runway for this, as I want to make sure that the two are taken care of.

I have two questions. Would it be unethical to rehome only one of the dogs? My living situation will allow me to keep **a** pet, and he's adjusted well to apartment living. She hasn't adjusted very well, but that aside, there are no behavioral issues that might present an obstacle to rehoming.

Does anyone have any advice in where to *start* in finding a home for the dog? Sites or services or what have you? I don't have anything resembling a personal network where I'm at, so I can't exactly ask friends for this.

And for anyone that's done this before, how did you get through it emotionally speaking? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't racked with guilt. The poor treatment of the dogs was a large part of what prompted me to move out of my parents' house before I was otherwise planning to. And yet, here I am essentially planning on pawning one of them off. A part of me knows it's to give her a better life, but I can't help but feel like a failure for not being able to make it work. I don't want my pride and shame to stand in the way of doing what would be in the dogs' best intertest, but it hurts.

We have a Toller of almost 2 years old now. She is usually very sweet to people and dogs. Of course she has her doubts about new people coming into our house. But after some time she always like them. Same with dogs.

Now the problem we have is that as of late she can sometimes be very unpredictable. For example this morning she went and greet a loose dog and her owner in the field. Laying on her back and cuddling. Next they start running in the field having some fun. But everytime she thinks the other dog gets to close to her or runs away from her she lifts her mouth and shows teeth. Normally she has this with smaller dogs only and for this reason I dont let her play with smaller breeds. But this was a white shepard.

Even then most of the times I call her to me and stop the playing. But this morning she suddenly looked to go into prey drive, chase the other dog and growl/be aggressive. Then it turned into a fight which I had to break up. It's totally my bad and feel very guilty. But she knew this dog for over a year and play very often and we never had problems.

I can see that she's very locked in when it happened and I almost could not get her attention.

I dont know what this could have triggered. I think in total its the 2nd time this ever happened (one time before with a smaller dog). No injuries on both dogs whatsoever. But I really hate it.

What could be the reason behind this? We have socialised her early with dogs, never went to dog parks and always try to avoid these situations. One thing that comes to mind is that she just has been in heat. And maybe she has a false pregnancy which can affect her mood?  
Anyone recognize this behaviour or has some tips what to do with it? Or how to train it?

I can avoid these situations by never letting her play again. But she is normally always so sweet and gentle. So to take that from her feels bad as well.

Looking forward to see some reactions.",t2_3r3hp86f,0,Sudden change in behavior - advice requested.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zslwr3,True,Toineduroin,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zslwr3/sudden_change_in_behavior_advice_requested/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zslwr3/sudden_change_in_behavior_advice_requested/,2474089,1671715133,0,,False,1671715146,1671715147,2022-12-22 13:18:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,dogs,"We've got a 5 month old lab puppy who has always been used to a playpen rather than a crate. I've finally replaced the pen with a crate today as although he only had the pen over once the size, strength and weight of him now he could easily clear / knock over / move the pen if he ever decided to. This hasn't been an issue really as he's very good at settling in the pen and just sleeps in there and has since a couple of weeks of having him and there has always been someone in (both wfh). But wanted to get him in something safer and more long term whilst he's still young and happy with change.

We've sized the crate based on the crate mat he was using in his pen as it's his favourite bed. The crate is maybe a couple of inches bigger than the bed as I can just see the tray. It's also only a couple of inches taller than the pen. However it is a little shorter in general than the pen (there was a fair amount of carpet showing at the end when crate mat was in pen).

Puppy has immediately taken to his crate as if it was indeed still the pen, goes in on command, settles, had 10 minutes in no whining etc (we want to work up to normal alone time he would have in pen just incase).

The crate itself is a size up from the one recommended for his breed at full size. We have room for it and he seems happy enough so far. I can't help but worry slightly though having seen all the articles about 'correct crate sizes'. I could change the crate size and get him a smaller bed if needed and not against buying a different crate in the future if it does become a problem. Just wondering what the general consensus is on crate sizing and potential issues?

232,dogs,"Hey y’all,

I recently adopted a 2 year old Shiba Inu from friends, who used to attend competitions and was then used for breeding, so he has learned some commands, however I think he has forgotten most. He is not food motivated at all, so I’m wondering how I could reteach him these commands. For example when I tried reteaching him sit, I tried doing it by holding up food in front of him and moving it backwards, so he’d sit down. However, he doesn’t even keep his eyes on the food, quickly losing interest if it’s too far behind his eyesight instead of sitting down to look at it. The snacks I’ve tried are cooked chicken breasts, dried meat, and normal dog food. Maybe he just doesn’t like these? Does anyone have any alternative snack ideas? Or alternatives in general?

I’ve also tried puzzle toys with him because he sometimes seems bored at home, always needing me to play with him (and trust me, I play a lot with him), but he doesn’t really get how they work. Does anyone maybe know some easy puzzle toys, maybe even ones I can diy?

Also, bonus question: how long should his walks be every day? At the moment I walk him twice a day, in the morning about half an hour, in the evening about one and a half hours. He still seems pretty hyper when we come home after walks (begging me to play some more fetch with him) and seems reluctant to go home (normally he comes immediately when I call him on walks, but when he knows we’ll be going home, he doesn’t come when called but wants to go farther).

I have a 2 year old male beagle. He is a good dog, loves me and my mother a lot. He is a little aggressive. Growls if you do something he doesn't like (pick him up/touch him too much). If you annoy him, he will scratch you with his teeth. 

This was always a problem. But we talked to some people and they told us to take his ""growling"" seriously. 

Today my mother picked him up. During winters, he likes affection even though he is not affectionate. But idk what happened. He growled when she picked him up and by the time i could tell her to leave him, he bit her temple. He didn't let go of her immediately but only when she pushed him off. 

She had to get 4 injections, no stitches but there is a lot of swelling and she is in a lot of pain. 

I don't live with my parents. I only visit them twice a year. I am suddenly so scared to leave my dog alone with them. What if he does something else? 

We live in a rural area so we don't have access to trainers. Should I take him with him? Should I put him down? I love him so much, and i know he is not evil. He is just a dog.

239,dogs,It’s the first week of getting another addition to our fur tribe. My boyfriend has an Aussie who is 11 and we got our new dog from an out of state family who is 2. The Aussie is a bit of a resource guarder and has started sleeping on the new dogs bed when he didn’t at first. He started to today about the 5th day in. I’m not sure if this is another resource guarding tactic or not. But if so what’s the best way to rectify this behavior? We let the new dog sleep in our bed but want her bed available if she prefers it. She’s super submissive so I don’t think they would just swap/she wouldn’t go in his bed.,t2_je4sehfy,0,Older dog sleeping in new dogs bed,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zshpkz,True,MechaMothera,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zshpkz/older_dog_sleeping_in_new_dogs_bed/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zshpkz/older_dog_sleeping_in_new_dogs_bed/,2474043,1671700699,0,,False,1671700715,1671700716,2022-12-22 09:18:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

241,dogs,"My parents got me a puppy when I was 11 so I would stop picking on my brother since they were gone working for 12+ hours a day and I wouldn't stop asking for one. My family life was turbulent growing up bc of parents' strained relationship and (imo) general inconsideracy on my dad's part. I had issues with bullying at that age so I became really attached to my dog, and generally detached to my family. My parents would threaten to abandon/kill/etc her when I was at school to get me to listen to them, my dad thought it was a funny joke sometimes. My family also has history with abuse and my dog subsequently got dragged into it and now is reactive to people approaching her with clothes-hangers or rod type objects when she's on a bed. It was also difficult to convince them to buy pet products and expenses (i.e. spay surgery) because they didn't like her. Notably, my grandpa told my dad he would only allow him to help pay for the surgery if he got rid of the dog, so I started working freelance to cover vet bills and pet stuff when I was 13-14.

My dog is 9 now and I'm in university, my parents are her primary caretakers (house w backyard) now because I'm moving around constantly/pet friendly housing is too limited, small, and expensive around my campus/I'm worried about her quality of life if I move her with me. My parents are now in a significantly better place financially and they're happier/less violent/less frustrated now. But at the same time my parents are very indifferent about taking care of her, especially with stuff like daily walks, teeth brushing, and fur brushing. They do it once in a while if they feel like it and have time, which I can appreciate knowing they don't like her and hate touching her 'filth' (i.e. poop, teeth, saliva, fur), especially with my mom whose tried making it a daily effort to brush the teeth and walk once she knew how important it was to me. I made an appointment earlier today with my vet to get dental examination done and potentially discuss extraction because of periodontal disease. I've always put the exam/cleaning off because I couldn't afford it back then and thought I could get it under control if I just kept brushing her teeth regularly and thought we had it under control. When I saw how easily her gums bled and the amount of buildup on her teeth when I came back for Winter break, I felt like I died a bit inside.

I feel really guilty about her quality of life and I've realized that now in retrospect on how she wasn't taken care of the best across all categories of pet care. I don't blame my parents, I get that taking care of something you don't really like is hard and they're trying, I don't think there was much I could've done when I was 11-19 either because I was a child. I just feel really guilty for getting my dog because I wanted a companion and I feel like she could've had a better and happier life elsewhere, especially now that she's getting old but still somehow so sweet despite all the shit she went through. I wished I had walked her more, I wished I had brushed her teeth more often, I wish I took better care of her and wasn't so lazy back then, and I really wish she lived in a household that loves and wants her there.

I'm moving out with my boyfriend (FT WFH) to complete the last year of university to a more longterm place next year and planning to bring her with us. My boyfriend has met her, likes her, is excited about taking care of a dog (I've warned him abt the fur everywhere, dog smell, and so on) and is generally more active and disciplined than I am. I'm trying to get all of the dental stuff out of the way before I return to school for Winter, I'm trying to get my mom enrolled in obedience with her (she is like an ok dog for obedience, but she only listens to me because no one else has ever worked with her), I drive back every 2 weeks to clip her nails and hope they shorten, and I want to give her a healthy, disease free life. She got me through a lot of shit and I just feel awful about how she's lived for 9 years because of me wanting a companion as a child and then me being complacent as a teen.

My boyfriend knows it's important to me to live with my dog as soon as I can, but he doesn't know the amount of guilt and anger I feel towards myself. Also grew up distant with my parents and so it's hard to discuss emotions, so I don't know who in real life I would rant this to.",t2_v4x87gwi,0,I feel guilty about getting my dog,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zsh2jv,True,asjdjfbj1234,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zsh2jv/i_feel_guilty_about_getting_my_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zsh2jv/i_feel_guilty_about_getting_my_dog/,2474032,1671698454,0,,False,1671698466,1671698466,2022-12-22 08:40:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

251,dogs,"Hi everyone! I live in the Midwest where we are forecasted to get subzero temperatures this week, lows going down to -8 deg F. Wind chill might be -35 deg. 50 mph winds, ""blizzard-like"" conditions possible.   


I have a 11 month old Golden Retriever, 70 pounds. This is my first experience with subzero temps with a dog, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do and how much cold he can tolerate. He is potty trained to not go in the house and hasn't in a long time, although he used to go on pee pads when he was 1-3 months old. I live in an apartment with no backyard, he usually pees at the bottom of the stairs and then we need to walk him a block away for him to poop 3x a day (it's the closest grassy area).    


I'm not sure what to do during the storm. Is it still safe to take him to the bottom of the stairs at least? Even if it's -35 deg windchill? I don't have a coat or boots for him, should I try getting some? I'm looking to see if I can maybe order some for 1 day delivery on prime or something or maybe get to a pet store before the storm hits, but not sure if he needs a coat or if his natural coat is sufficient for a quick run downstairs, and he won't be used to the boots but maybe he will just have to learn fast?

My entire family rushed outside to find her hiding, struggling to walk, and extremely fearful. We had no idea what had happened and have yet to figure it out.
I rushed her to the vet as soon as I could, where they took down my number wrong. They closed for the weekend, and on Monday, I finally got ahold of them.
They informed me that she was doing much better, but that she had suffered quite a few severe pelvic fractures, but she was already weight baring on all 4 legs, and the vet expected a good prognosis. He informed us that had it played out any differently, it could have been a catastrophic injury. He also said that finding a vet in our area to perform the surgery to repair the fractures would be almost impossible.
On the bright side, he expects her to do just fine after she heals, with pain management for arthritis in her elderly future. He said, verbatim, that she would walk with a ""pimp limp"" but that she would recover.

I figured he just scraped it while being rowdy out in the yard. We’ve been staying with family for the past couple days, and they have two dogs of their own. When we visit, all three dogs are honestly just kind of doing their own thing running around playing, they really only come hang out with the family at night when they go to sleep.

So, as I read up on this, it looks like the following scenario is what we're potentially facing:
We are the happy owner of a dog. He's about 3 years old. Since we've had him, he's had an abscess drained by his jaw (cause unknown but has not recurred in 2 years), an ear infection, an unexplained swelling by his jaw (lasted 2 days, probably aggravated a salivary gland from pulling on leash to hard) and I am sure his records say something about diarrhea for some reason.
He's definitely a healthy dog, just had a normal run of issues.
My take is that if there is any way for the insurance companies to say ""oops he had jawline swelling 4 years ago, that throat cancer is pre-existing"" or ""it says he had diarrhea 3 years ago, that bowel cancer is pre-existing"" and not pay out, they will. Is that pretty accurate based on people's experiences?
Also, we've taken him to like 3 different vets of his lifetime, are they going to expect us to dredge up the vet records for all these vets at some point?
At this point I am viewing pet insurance as likely only covering him if he gets squished by a car or something, god forbid.",t2_utah31mv,0,Pet insurance questions,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zsb8ge,True,ManyTransition4490,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zsb8ge/pet_insurance_questions/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zsb8ge/pet_insurance_questions/,2473948,1671680790,0,,False,1671680802,1671680803,2022-12-22 03:46:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

263,dogs,"I just wanted to share this because it’s cute, and it made me cry a bit. I used to have 5 dogs. Oldest to youngest was Piggy, Harley, Lilo, Annabelle, and Pinto Bean. When Piggy got too weak to chew bones, Harley started chewing bones for her. She would take one bone, chew half of it into a goopy mess, and then deliver the goop to Piggy, who would then eat it happily. When Harley got too weak to do that, Lilo started to do it. Completely untrained. 

When we lost Piggy and Harley (back to back), we adopted two senior dogs, Molly and Mikey. Lilo instantly loved them. She would always try to take care of them, like she used to for Harley and Piggy. When Molly passed, my husband and I moved with Mikey. Yesterday we finally went back for Lilo. 

Today I got Lilo a pig’s snout. Mikey wanted a bite but he has no teeth, so he just sat and watched. I watched as Lilo split the snout in half, chewed one half into a goopy mess, and then brought the goop over to Mikey. She sniffed his head and nibbled his ear a bit, then she walked away. He was so excited to eat the pigs ear, and he loved every bite. 

I’ve never had dogs as generous as Lilo and Harley. Harley taught Lilo all of this, and now Lilo just loves to care for other dogs, especially senior dogs.

265,dogs,"I have a two year old coonhound. about six months ago, he started exhibiting some unusual behaviors when his hip area was touched. This progressed to him biting a family member, seemingly out of nowhere. After a vet visit, two weeks on anti-inflammatories, and then finally an X-Ray, we've discovered he has hip dysplasia.

His symptoms have only gotten worse since we started investigating them with the vet -- he stayed up all night whining two weeks ago, too pained to lie down. My sister's dog (his best friend since puppyhood) is here for the holidays and he just gives him warning barks every time he wants to play. He's been a completely different dog -- understandably, because of his pain -- but it's become really difficult to live with. He's very snappy and overly cautious. He won't go in the crate and gets up a lot at night. He was prescribed Rimadyl temporarily but it's seemed to have little, if any effect. His vet wants to switch to an expensive medicine called Previcox that'll cost over 100 dollars for a 30 day supply.

I'm praying there's a light at the end of the tunnel for him - and that there's some way to manage his pain and get him back to the goofy, energetic puppy he used to be. He's miserable, I'm miserable, and we're basically trapped in the house together until his pain is a bit more manageable. I had no idea hip dysplasia could occur in such a young dog and wish I'd known what to look out for so that this could've been managed before it got so painful.

267,dogs,"My puppy is 7 months old and has been randomly throwing up several times in one day, about once or twice a week-ish for the last month or so. 

I’ve been desperately racking my brains trying to figure out why, but it’s just so random. Sometimes morning, sometimes afternoon, sometimes night. Sometimes after activity, sometimes after a nap, sometimes after waking up in the morning. We were told to change food 2 weeks ago because I didn’t realize the food I’d had him on was on that FDA cardiomyopathy no-no list and they were concerned. They kept pushing Hill’s, who they practically run a satellite shop for. They insist it’s just because bigger companies do more stringent checks and have more clearly defined policies for things like allergen cross-contact (more important for me than my pooch), etc. 

Just given that they ONLY sell Hill’s and ONLY ever seem to recommend Hill’s (but are willing to refer me to veterinary nutritionists), what’s the likelihood they’re getting kickbacks to promote Hill’s? I just find it so bizarre. I don’t like the amount of fillers in Hill’s, and that all of their food seems to be [insert protein]-meal based. I found another food that my puppy loves, and we transitioned to it 2 weeks ago.  Now we’re being told to change food again… to Hill’s. No transition, just a hard change. I asked, and the vet said because it’s a special food for digestive issues, we don’t need to transition. 

That seems insane to me. Is that insane? I just feel like my puppy has had all these allergy symptoms that have spanned now 4 different brands of food (itching, skin rashes, yeast infections in his ears, multiple bouts of conjunctivitis) and their best suggestion is to change him to Hill’s immediately every time.

275,dogs,"Let me start off by saying I am a very loving person. I have two children and would do anything for them. I am known for my caring nature. 
Okay so here,
My whole life I’ve never not liked animals. Ive always thought they were cute. But owning one never interested me. Ive had pets growing up and always liked them at first but then as they grew up id just see them as in inconvenience. 
I moved in with my boyfriend and his parents  about 8 years ago (now husband) who has a horrible family dog. He peed on my stuff constantly, pooped in the house. Cried to be fed when people are eating. And it really just solidified my thoughts of never wanting to own a pet. 
Fast forward 4 years, my husband and I buy a house with a huge yard. He’s always mentioned that he wanted a dog. And I always brush it off and say no. I could be perfectly content never having a pet. He knows this, every one knows I’m not a pet person. 
Rewind to 3 weeks ago. My husband starts obsessing over getting a dog. Looking at breeds daily. Contacting adoption places. He found a breed he became obsessed with and made it his mission to find that dog. He finds it. He contacts them. And gets the dog. I see how excited he is to finally have his dog. But I’m so unhappy. I never wanted this and I have no idea what to do because my oldest daughter and him are in love with her. 
But I feel so hurt because I never wanted this and now we have a dog. I resent my husband and I hate feeling this way. He knows I’m upset and offered to get rid of the dog but why would I upset everyone just because I don’t like animals? 
I really don’t know what to do.

277,dogs,"To start off I wanted to say that I did try to talk, to explain, to teach, but my parents are slavic (as am I) from the silent generation and don't believe they could ever do wrong, it's tough. 

My dog is a 7 year old mix breed from a shelter and weights 10kg.

They take care of my dog when I can't, since I am living by myself (don't come at me - ugly breakup) and this is actually happening less and less due to how they treat my dog. They are overbearing and overloving.

They give my dog way too many treats, big ones, not those little ones and too much human food and sometimes even sugar and chocolate(!) and they do know about the risks involved. They claim she will be fine, because their Leonberger never had issues (until they had to put him down for food poisoning at age 7 - claiming he was poisoned by someone else, but the way they act around my dog makes me question that) and he could eat it all. They often forget to put away the cookies from the coffee table when they go out and my dog eats them.

I myself never even have cookies to start, because I eat them all anyways. Other snacks are mostly eaten up by me before I could even have the chance to leave them in the open, anyways, and if I'd leave them be, then my dog wouldn't touch them at my place, because that has also happened.

My dog knows she can do fuck all at my parents place because she is sooooo adorable they forgive her anything and won't even scold her and tell her off to her place. There is no discipline and she even gets fed directly from the table making her super beggarish when I'm with her by myself - at least she won't snatch it out of my hand like my moms. 

Now the worst part. They are overexcersizing her. She will go on way too long walks coming home so exhausted she just drops to the floor to sleep, but(!) she won't get peace since my parents try to engage her into playing until she growls, shows her teeth and BITES! She gives plenty of warning and you can tell when she wants to play and when she doesn't. My mom actually got bitten in the finger hard enough that she would bleed and then had the audacity to scold my dog over it! But she never would have scolded my dog for other stuff.

This is not discipline in my eyes, but the attempt of total control. They also both hate to see when my dog listens to me more than to them. 

I know the first comments will suggest to not bring her over. However, that is not an option. I can try to minimise contact but I need some strong pointers on why their treatment of my dog is bad for the dog and how my dog and I could get in trouble if she's more aggressive towards people.",t2_t62f69v,0,My parents don't understand how to treat a smaller dog and it's quite abusive,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,3.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,True,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zs79sx,True,celebral_x,,1,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zs79sx/my_parents_dont_understand_how_to_treat_a_smaller/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zs79sx/my_parents_dont_understand_how_to_treat_a_smaller/,2473893,1671670408,0,,False,1671670426,1671670426,2022-12-22 00:53:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are four varieties of [Belgian Shepherd Dog – the Groenendae](https://youtu.be/gejhdl8Pph8)l, Tervueren, Malinois and Laekenois – named after the areas in Belgium from which they came. Hardworking sheepdogs from Belgium have been recognised since the Middle Ages. In the 1890s a professor of the Belgian School of Veterinary Sciences recorded standards for the various types of Belgian sheepdogs. It was noted that they were all similar in type with the main difference being the coat. The professor then divided them into varieties and advised breeding them as separate breeds. The Groenendael dog breed was developed from a black bitch of the Belgian sheepdog type being crossed with another black herding dog.

My dog is a *really* fussy eater, even down to refusing things that are bad but delicious. It is quite normal for her to eat once a day (usually at night time).

Shes been having a bad eye for a while and was on liquid pain relief which I can only give her if she's eaten, so there's been some days she couldn't have it.

Today she had to have an operation to have her eye removed and as you can imagine, I want her to take her pain relief at all costs.

I rang my vet at 9pm after she had refused to eat dog food, dog treats, chicken, ham, sausage, meatballs, cheese and beef (admittedly I even tried to force feed her a bit in the end because she desperately needs these pain meds). The vet suggested getting some lukewarm soup, putting it in a syringe, and slowly syringing it into her mouth.

I thought, well I doubt that'll work but I'll give it a go. Made some chicken soup, got it in a syringe. After the first little bit, she was absolutely loving it, lapping it up, I couldn't get the syringe filled up quick enough.

293,dogs,"Hello dog owners of reddit! 

Past History: extracapsular repair of stifle in 2016 (no longer have access to actual surgery report) right hind leg

My dog started limping (right hind leg) roughly 3 weeks ago. Took him to the vet (I work there), took rads, and couldn't find anything. We did vetprofen, gabapentin, and strict rest for 2 weeks. 

He is still not walking on it. On reevaluation, we could not find anything (multiple drs weighed in on his case). Dr notes are as followed: joint effusion and crepitus present in stifle but no cranial drawer or tibial thrust present. R/o meniscal tear vs scar tissue tear vs other.

Went to the specialist today and they believe it to be a meniscus tear, but it is impossible to say until they open him up. They don't anticipate anything else other than the tear, but worse case scenario, they would have to re-stitch the previous repair or do a TPLO. The estimate I was given ranged from $3,800-$5000. 

I'm not rich (I work at a vet clinic myself) but I've got ""rainy day"" savings. I told them it really could not be well over 5k. 

I was wondering if people here had experience, and would share it with me? Recovery, cost, and so on. His surgery date is 1/11 (first available)

298,dogs,"My family got a Yorkie/Shih Tzu mix puppy, Max, last December to be a companion for our older dog who had started to lose her sight. He was extremely anxious at first and often ran and hid from everyone for the first week or two. I wasn't living at home then and when I first met him he peed twice he was so scared. Slowly Max started to open up and feel safe around us. Everyone except my brother. 

My brother ""Bob"" is very reclusive. He lives in my parents' basement and doesn't spend much time around the family. Recently, we've begun to suspect that he has Borderline Personality Disorder. I won't go into BPD, but the main facet of personality disorders is that the person doesn't think and perceive the world in the way that most other people do. He has never liked dogs or cats. He's had a few birds, but the responsibility ended up falling on my mom because he wasn't taking care of them well enough. All in all, he's not a very nurturing person. 

Bob did not take the time like the rest of us to let Max get used to him. He mostly ignored him, and sometimes got annoyed with Max and would be sharp with him. As Max grew, he became more defensive than submissive to Bob.  When Bob comes upstairs, Max runs to be next to me or my parents and growls, which has caused Bob to be even more impatient and sometimes angry with him. Bob insisted that he's tried to be nice to Max, but he doesn't really get that he needs to be consistent in order for Max to get comfortable around him. From Bob's perspective, Max is the one with the problem. 

I'm wondering if there's anything that can be done to calm Max down and make him less defensive when Bob is around. He started on anxiety medication three weeks ago, which has helped in some ways, but he still growls most of the time when Bob is in the room. Bob has physical and mental health issues that make it impossible for him to work right now, so him moving out isn't an option. And until he really commits to therapy (it's been a difficult process to get him to go consistently), it's highly unlikely that Bob will make any effort to adjust his own behavior.
 
I moved back home a few months ago and have done what I can to mitigate any issues, but I can't be around all the time and I'm nervous that Bob might do something that provokes Max to fully attack him, and that Bob might hurt him in response. I know this is a tough situation and that there's probably not much that can be done with Bob living at home, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to them.",t2_13hsbp,0,My family's 1 year old dog is afraid of my brother and it's causing problems.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zs2zp4,True,OrchardPotato,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zs2zp4/my_familys_1_year_old_dog_is_afraid_of_my_brother/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zs2zp4/my_familys_1_year_old_dog_is_afraid_of_my_brother/,2473835,1671660943,0,,False,1671660958,1671660959,2022-12-21 22:15:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
299,dogs,I’m looking for advice on how to help my dog with the difficult time we’re in. Yesterday I had to make the decision to put to rest my old girl. She had become suddenly sick for 4 days and was just to much for her last night. That leaves me and my other dog (his names Happy). I could tell he knew something was wrong because he wouldn’t get close to her at all and he backed away from her the whole time. He knew she was sick. And I had locked him in my kitchen while I spent some time with my other dog last night before taking her to the vet and every time she cried he’d start howling which is extremely unusual for him as he very rarely barks or anything of the sort. Ever since coming home last night without her he has been very withdrawn and keeps going into her kennel and just staring before coming back. He seems very confused and I’m not sure if it’s just me projecting or what but I’m not sure what to do to help. I’m worried he’s waiting for her and doesn’t know she’s not coming back. The only time I’ve felt with animals passing and how it affects the other animals it was ok because we had their body’s at home and left the other dogs say goodbye. We couldn’t do that this time though and I don’t know how to help him. I’m also worried that he’s going to be super lonely. I live in the basement of my parents house and he can’t come upstairs because they have a super aggressive dog that will attack any dog she sees. All he has is me and I’m worried I’m not enough. How can I make it to where he won’t be lonely? Is spending almost all day till my family gets home enough for him?

303,dogs,"Recently a text post came up suggesting many unrealistic timetables of dogs for exercise.

It depends on breed, age and other factors.

But one thing to highlight is clear routine, ideally coordinating with the dog's ""Circadian rhythm"" eg wake up time is constant, eating time is constant, interaction time, resting time then arousal time and further exercise and stimulation post-eating and so on each day. In addition the exercise time for active breeds can be important for peristalsis and digestion of their meal and then the ability to successfully DEFECATE and feel relaxation from voiding the faecal matter.

I think one problem from dogs with little or no routine for exercise aka ""walks"" or lower frequency of these and duration and low intensity is the reduction in peristalsis which then may make the dog's ability to void it's bowls less comfortable for the dog. It's very important if the dog does not have total access to an area it can defecate when it feels the need. The exercise and running peristalsis usually some hours after feeding is a natural trigger along with scenting and using olfactory stimulus.

Please bear this in mind too in addition to walking/exercise duration and frequency.",t2_11moxt,0,"Regular ""Walking"" of dogs: Important for ""peristalsis"" and Circadian rhythm for dogs each day.","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zs0tgs,True,Psittacula2,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zs0tgs/regular_walking_of_dogs_important_for_peristalsis/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zs0tgs/regular_walking_of_dogs_important_for_peristalsis/,2473803,1671656631,0,,False,1671656647,1671656647,2022-12-21 21:03:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
304,dogs,"Seeking advice: Gastrointestinal issues for 10-month-old rescue. Frequent loose stools.

Seeking any suggestions for my poor baby, Mazzy Stardust, who is suffering super loose stools/ diarrhea frequently. Her poop is usually better in the morning and then gets looser throughout the day. She often strains to poop and it starts out more firm and gets softer in the same release. I’ve gotten all the various blood and stool testing done. When I got her 5 months back she had tapeworms and giardia which we treated and confirmed cleared. Now we are trying the hydrolized protein/ hypoallergenic dog food to see if it’s a food allergy. It’s been 2.5 weeks and still having totally terrible poops. I’ve also tried pumpkin prior. Vet currently recommends sticking 100% to the special hypoallergenic food. She’s a 10-month old mix breed (husky, cattle dog, pit amongst others).

The upside is she seems still healthy—good energy and mood and decent weight (though I think she could stand to grow more and am worried she’s not absorbing nutrients well to do so).

She has a couple of things that we still need to teach her but  all in all she's a fast learner und we're not too worried about most of  her behavior. There are, however, two things that are becoming a problem  for us. She likes too constantly lick everyone. No problem there. The  problem is that she loves to eat poop. Gross but usually not that  dramatic despite the increased risk of giardia and other fun parasites. A  dog that likes to eat poop and lick you whenever she gets the chance  isn't great, but alas, it is what it is.

We  also have a nearly 5-months-old baby that we've kept separate from the  dog (adopted at the start of the month). At some point though we will  remove the small fence we've put in our home and our little one will get  to know her and leave his toys lying around. We can't keep them apart  forever.

We are starting to be  worried about her poop eating habits. A dog that licks our  baby and may also lick or carry his toys after eating poop outside does not seem very healthy, to use a euphemism.

319,dogs,"We recently adopted a 2-year old hungarian rescue (mix; possibly labrador / belgian or hungarian shepherd)  that was in foster care for a couple of months. She has a couple of things that we still need to teach her but all in all she's a fast learner und we're not too worried about most of her behavior. There are, however, two things that are becoming a problem for us. She likes too constantly lick everyone. No problem there. The problem is that she loves to eat poop. Gross but usually not that dramatic despite the increased risk of giardia and other fun parasites. A dog that likes to eat poop and lick you whenever she gets the chance isn't great, but alas, it is what it is. 

We also have a nearly 5-months-old baby that we've kept separate from the dog (adopted at the start of the month). At some point though we will remove the small fence we've put in our home and our little one will get to know her and leave his toys lying around. We can't keep them apart forever.

We are starting to be worried about her poop eating habits. A poop eating dog that licks our baby and may also lick or carry his toys after eating poop outside does not seem very healthy.

324,dogs,"Hi! I don’t know if this is the right place to ask this, but I don’t know where else to go. 

I am currently staying with family, and I brought my dog (poodle, five years old) with me. Every time we come here, she sneezes a lot. My family is convinced that she’s allergic to the grass, but I have never seen her react like this to any other grass (to be fair, she doesn’t have long periods of exposure to other grass). There is a rocky “dog run” area, but every time we put her in there, she will just jump over the fence into the grass. There there’s no way for us to keep her from doing that, because every time we tried to keep her from jumping, she found a way around it. 

I don’t like that she is uncomfortable, so I want to see if anyone has advice on what I should do here? Because I am out of town, I don’t have access to my regular vet. But, I could see a different vet, but I am not in the financial straits to be able to see them right now, and my family would not be willing to help me with this. 

They say I should just give her Benadryl, but I don’t want to make her lethargic. There’s a dog here that she loves to play with, and I’m worried the Benadryl will inhibit that. If I only gave her Benadryl at nights, would that help with her allergies throughout the day? Is there allergy medication for dogs that is relatively cheap that won’t make her lethargic?

we also have a morning routine- when he hears my phone he comes to my bed and throws himself into me like a little weighted blanket and gives me a little lick at the tip of my nose. we will lay there together for about 20 mins before we get up and go on our walk.

HOWEVER. 
he seems bored lately and hes been getting very aggressive since he was attacked in June. He seemed fine at first but around his 3rd birthday he became very defensive, to the point Im not comfortable taking him places with me anymore or to the court yard to play with our neighbors.

329,dogs,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

* My husband has owned/trained several rescue Pugs, German shepherd/border collie mix, and a few more
* I grew up with a family dog so less experience

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

*   Breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

* Family dog that loves children
* Good with cats (We have two)
* Spitz, husky/wolf-like appearance without the exercise requirements of a husky
* Loves spending all day with the family and is equally up for short walks (30 mins) as long walks (3 hours) as staying inside and watching TV sometimes
* Less breed health issues

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

* Keeshond + Finnish Lapphund, because they have the Spitz appearance with more family dog traits
* Some other spitz dogs seemed appealing but had more cons for us than the above 2. Ex: Eurasier but that has low availability in the US, Samoyed but that seemed to have more breed health issues

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

* Basic obedience with some tricks

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

* My husband and I have both worked from home for several years and are homebodies. We would be around nearly all the time.

* We would prefer an average of 1 hour/day on weekdays in the long run (Past puppy stage) with more hours on weekends (3/day). We tend to go on walks every day even without a dog rain or shine (or snow where we live) so this wouldn't be a lifestyle change for us
* There is a dog park a few minutes away we would go to

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Shedding - High level is fine
* Barking - High level is fine

* We would prefer to let the dog loose without worrying about it running away, going after other dogs/people, etc

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

* Either is fine 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

* Leaning slightly to more eager to please than do its own thing

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

* Anywhere from overly excited to aloof is fine. Main preference would be that the dog is not aggressive and wouldn't see any stranger as a threat

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Husband and I are on the same page; answered together

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

* Thanks anyone who reads/responds!
* From internet research, it seems like the main differences between Keeshonds and Finnish Lapphund is that the Finnish Lapphund has a stronger ""chase after squirrels and such"" drive and slightly higher exercise requirements. The Keeshond appears to be more eager to please. But unfortunately we don't know anyone in real life with either breed so hoping the community here can share their experiences.

331,dogs,"We got our second dog (Oliver) this past weekend which is an 8 week old Golden Retriever. Our first dog is a 5yo Staffy/mastiff cross (Opie), and they both get along really well and I couldn't be happier with that, even if we are a little sleep deprived from nighttime toilet schedules and them both wanting to play together at 3am.

The 'problem', if you can really call it that, comes with training. I've tried training them both together, but Opie has always been the only dog in our house until now and doesn't understand his own size or personal space, so he ends up almost taking over any sessions, getting in the way or distracting Oliver. I've thought about putting him in a different room when we do training but I'm worried about making Opie feel left out and it causing other problems down the line. One solution my wife and I have considered is taking Opie our for a walk when we want to train Oliver, but due to work schedules that isn't always possible.

I talked to the vet who assured me that thirst and urination can change with age and that without any other symptoms there’s no reason for further testing. I went home and immediately started wondering if there are actually more symptoms I just haven’t noticed as much. Is she sleeping more? Is she restless? Why is she laying down in a different posture than normal? Does she always lick herself that much?

340,dogs,"Hey everyone! 

So my wife and I rescued a 3-4 year old beagle / hound mix about a month ago and we’re really struggling with her. 

She’s an absolute sweetheart. Super cuddly and as nice tempered as you want, but she has some serious housebreaking issues. 

I’ve raised dogs in the past with my parents. A lab, a Bernese mountain dog and a husky / Shepard mix, but I’ve never experienced a dog who kinda reacts like this. 

She does a lot of submissive peeing, first off. We kinda got a hang of rectifying that with limiting our excitement when we come home, so she doesn’t pee herself in excitement. Her reaction to negative commands leads to me to think she’s been abused. 

But the big thing is she just can’t help but pee in the carpet whenever we’re not looking. 

For example, I’ll walk her, and an hour later, she’ll walk out of sight and pee. If I catch her in the act, I’ll give a really firm “No!” And take her right outside, but any kind of firm scolding like that causes her to pee herself. 

We tried crate training her and she just pees in the crate. I’ll walk her, go to the gym and workout and come home, and she’s wallowing in her own pee, sometimes poop too. 

We walk her 5-6 times a day, and she still pees in the house constantly. I give her treats and praise her whenever she pees outside but it still doesn’t have an effect. 

She’s extremely submissive, if I raise my voice cause I catch her, she cowers and pees herself. 

So it makes it hard to see how to properly train her, I certainly don’t want to build on any trauma she may have experienced previously. But the peeing is driving me to wits end. I feel like I can’t take my eye of her without scrubbing up pee.

342,dogs,"Hello, I've been wondering about getting a dog, perhaps next year or the year after. I'm a stay-at-home wife, so I'll have a lot of time to spend with the doggo, but since I have thalassemia, I'd rather not have a dog that needs too much exercise. I also spend much of the day on the computer or doing house chores, so I'd like one that won't bother me too much.

One day, I might conceive a child as well, so it has to be child-friendly. I'm thinking about adopting an older basset hound from a rescue or shelter and giving it daily walks for just 1 hour in total. Do you think this would be a good idea?

My views at the moment are quite clouded about this topic since the very first dog that I got this month was a lab/german shepherd 5 week old puppy. He was the sweetest little pup but often begged for attention, had to be taken outside millions of times for potty, had boundless energy so we had to play with him whenever he woke up, woke us up an average of 3 times every night to go for potty, and overall I felt trapped in between taking care of the puppy and doing chores all day. 

We only had him for a week, but couldn't give the puppy back to the seller since she didn't want it, so we gave him away to a nice lady who said she'd take him in.

343,dogs,"Hi there reddit,

I’ve recently relocated my work from working from home to an actual work place. (Not by my choice) and I have no say in it, nor i have a choice, i can’t leave either because i have a contract.

Now my dog, i’ve had her for 6 years, i can’t bring her to work because she is a high alert dog and she barks and people coming in and out, and that startles people and i run a place that requires absolute focus. Plus my boss said i can’t bring a dog because it’s not sanitary.

I’m not sure what to do with my dog anymore because i’ve ask everyone around me to help me take care of her, i do not have any family members, a friendly neighbors that can help, and i can’t take her to day care because my hours are 10 am to 10 pm and most doggy day care places close at 6 pm. 

I can still keep her of course, but i don’t know how good it will be for her to being with me 24/7 since she was a puppy, to now being by herself 12 hours a day..

Also recently my ex of 7 years and I split, he originally bought her for me as a surprise, and now he doesn’t want to take her either even though he works for himself and can bring her to his work.

Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.

344,dogs,"Hello hello, i'm very new to this subreddit so i'm sorry if i break any rules (i just read them). My dog (it's a stafford, american i'm pretty sure even tho i live in the EU) really seems like shes slowly dying... My parents usually take care of her so i don't necessarily see her every single day, but yesterday i went in to the garage and just saw her being so incredibly weak and skinny... I could see her bones from her head to her lungs. Apparently she doesn't want to eat either and she used to vomit and pee/poop inside of the house really often. 

My parents didn't treat her the best to be honest, sometimes she got treated pretty poorly and she didn't get as much attention as she deserves (even tho i tried to give her some extra attention when i could and i also really tried to let her sleep and chill in my room but she was just never behaving, as much as i tried to make it work...). It breaks me that she didn't always get the life she deserved but that's not the point right now.

How can i help her? Is there anything i can do to try and save her? Apparently she refuses to eat food aswell and she can't really walk anymore either... I really want to be able to help her. Feel free to ask me more questions or information if needed.

Thanks a lot for the future comments.

348,dogs,"I'm a long time dog owner seeking help. I've owned various breeds over the last 15-20 years but I'm running out of things to do to curb my PWD's behavior.

She is 3 years old and super intense, some would say aggressive. She loves people and other dogs but she has the in your face intensity. She will literally go straight into another dogs grill, which could be perceived as aggression and the other dogs reaction can go either way. She does this to trigger engagement, say hello, and get other dogs to play with her. She has never violently attacked another dog with malicious intent. The best way to summarize this is that she is high energy and loves to play hard. 

A few of the issues:

* She was kicked out of doggy day care for being too intense. As I stated, some dogs would get defensive, but that's her personality. The facility owner knows she's not an aggressive dog, but the way our dog plays has a triggering effect on others. I understood.
* She gets through the invisible fence, constantly. She sees another dog walking across the street and bolts to say hello. And this is the only time she gets through -- she has no self-control.
* Very intense and over-excited when people visit our home. She may even nip visitors but she's literally jumping on them, licking, nipping, and over-excited.
* We have another dog - mini golden doodle. He's super sweet and has picked up some of her bad habits. However, she's even intense with him at times. When she wants to play she'll grab a ball or a large toy and literally jump on him, and rub her face and toy against his face. Her favorite play activity is tug of war, so she's trying to trigger a response out of him to play. She's a very persistent dog and will do this until he reacts either positively or negatively.

What we've done up to this point:

* We did puppy training -- dropped her off twice a week at a facility from 9-5. They would do basic training, and socialization skills. Did this until she was about 9mos old.
* We continued to take her to dog parks to keep her socialized. We would also go to our neighbors home with a fenced yard to play with their dog (lab/greyhound mix). Her intensity and energy was even too much for their dog.
* I have done as much @ home training as I possible could. She knows every single command you can teach a dog: sit, stay, lay down, on-leash walking, off-leash walking, no/wait, and she's also trained NOT to run through the front door when it's open.
   * All of these commands would go out the window if there's a visitor, or a dog nearby. It's like she has ADHD or something and becomes hyper focused.
* When she was 2yrs old we took her back to the training facility to help us. We dropped her off 2 days a week 9-5, for 4 months. The training feedback was - she knows all the commands and is well trained, but we need to work on her intensity (no duh). They were slowly trying to integrate her to groups. We employed the same technique they were at home to reinforce it, but there was little to no progress over that time. So we withdrew.

I'm unsure what to do next. We've stopped taking her to the dog park to avoid any confrontations. At some point I'd really like to be able to take her back, but I don't want to be that dog owner.

356,dogs,"
Hey all! My wife and I recently brought home a [Golden Retriever pup](https://imgur.com/a/v1v4r51), he turns 3 months old this week. And he LOVES stuffed dog toys. He's figured out where his toy basket is and is now big enough to reach inside. Mind you, he has all sorts of toys: rubber and hard plastic chew toys, rope toys of various sizes, and even a puzzle toy. But he loves his stuffed toys.

Over the last month the stuffed toys haven't been lasting as long. Which isn't at all surprising to us; he's a big boy with a strong mouth already. But when he wants to play with a stuffed toy, he will throw a little tantrum if he can't get to one.   The ropes and rubber chews just aren't good enough for him sometimes (maybe they just feel better as he's starting to teeth, idk). 

Here's the question: Can anyone suggest **stuffed toys that are safe to destroy** (no squeaker he might swallow/pup-safe stuffing), are built well enough to **last more than 3 days** without getting a hole, **and/or are cheap enough we can regularly replace them**? 

I know ""indestructible"" stuffed toys don't exist, not for dogs of his size, but if we can find toys he can safely rip apart or that we can cheaply replace once they do rip it would be amazing! 

Note: we do plan to wean him off the stuffed toys as he gets bigger, probably cut them out once he finishes teething. Any stuffed toys we get now would be to bridge the gap as we wean him off over the next couple months.",t2_2t4zywnb,0,Stuffed Toys for Golden Pup?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zrs6cc,True,SierraPapaHotel,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zrs6cc/stuffed_toys_for_golden_pup/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zrs6cc/stuffed_toys_for_golden_pup/,2473687,1671638643,0,,False,1671638655,1671638656,2022-12-21 16:04:03,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=eb21968f594af24af51b5ea1fadbbaf38c0212bb', 'width': 3024, 'height': 4032}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b740f8d51a90c3cf656cebe4d45bcdc42ff80fc1', 'width': 108, 'height': 144}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f6d96f0b6719404acbf23d788153071086fc0a', 'width': 216, 'height': 288}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db679d44f82156f103b50534d2f30be4ef2cee91', 'width': 320, 'height': 426}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=053524c3ea0144146f25e155f66a44621f4e0292', 'width': 640, 'height': 853}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bce48baff5d2e08cf14bfad16789543ae01c352', 'width': 960, 'height': 1280}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/W3UDXo13K0QP4hbiVO4prTtaGyUjJ15SI5tLXqGveVk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6fa55ba3b191ccf65de7a8d0064999ab8894cd', 'width': 1080, 'height': 1440}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'sJrvBmC5Ko8Pmda2DYeQvXKhP3HEy1XHG710lGt07EM'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

360,dogs,"I know this post has been made a million times - mostly because I’ve read all of them. But I can’t help feeling guilty still. 

I just graduated college and live with my boyfriend who works full time. Because I graduated, I’m now working 8 hours a day, 4 days a week (sometimes less than 8 if I’m lucky). I have two pugs, one is 4 years old and the other is 2. 

They both seem to be perfectly okay while I’m gone. I have a camera set up, and they both sleep pretty much the entire time I’m gone (aside from waking up around 5 if I’m not home yet because they’re hungry). It’s also worth mentioning that I have to keep them separated in two areas of the house - it’s just safer because, on occasion, they fight, and I don’t want to risk it happening while no one is home. The little one gets run of a decent sized hallway/stairwell and the big one gets all of the downstairs.

While I have some friends that are able to come let them out when it’s going to be an extra long day/to feed them if I work past dinner time, we can’t afford daycare (nor would it work with our schedules), and I don’t really trust a wag/rover. I just keep seeing people saying it’s basically criminal to leave them alone this long. I give them a 30 minute walk in the morning before I go, frozen kongs to enjoy when I leave, and as much playtime as they want once I am home.

362,dogs,"Hey,
I have a 6-month-old puppy of a breed that is generally a one-person dog. My roommate has his sibling - both males. My roommate's puppy is definitely bonded to the roommate and is a one-person dog. Until yesterday I would say that my dog is also bonded to me, but now I am not so sure. However, he is definitely less ""one-person dog"" (if at all) than my roommate's dog. I am interested in your opinions about the situation I am going to describe because it really surprised me and made me confused about who is my dog's chosen one.

We were both at the vet because they both have different issues right now and we were both present while the dogs were examined. I held my dog so he wouldn't move (both dogs are scared of the vet), the vet examined him and afterward I let him go. He was on a leash the whole time of course. But while we waited there (the vet was examining something) my dog was pulling towards my roommate, sat next to her, and wanted to climb on her lap, basically looking for reassurance from her. And he didn't want to stay next to me and go away from her.

**My question is, who is my dog's chosen one?**

* Me? The dog follows me around all the time, welcomes me most, listens to me more, he never wants to follow my roommate, and he definitely never shows anxiety when she leaves or anything. But this could be also the result of the training. I was teaching him to follow me around since day 1 and now it might be just a reflex, a taught behavior. They don't meet that often, he is with me 95% of the time, so how could he choose her as his favorite? But why didn't he seek ""safety"" next to me?

* My roommate? He seeked reassurance from her when he was extremely anxious, so obviously he has to love her more, no? My roommate did hold her dog on a leash too, so it could be he was seeking comfort next to another dog - but when we switched the dogs, my dog still wanted to be with her even though my roommate's dog was with me. Maybe he chose her as his favorite because of his sibling, a pack will probably choose one person as the leader?

Hello dogs lovers. Looking for tips and advice. 
I have six dogs. All rescue dogs. All neutered. The first is a male beagle. The second is a female mixed breed who was pregnant when I took her in. she had two puppies, one boy one girl. 
The fifth is a boy mixed breed stocky labrador type. The 6th dog is a mixed golden retriever. 
Occasionally they will squabble and have nasty fights with each other, mainly the boys that do that. The girls are very docile and very well behaved. 

I live in open country, so I take them for long walks everyday. they run around freely but always stay near me or come back to me. All apart from the beagle, I need to keep him on a long leash, otherwise he will just run away for miles and miles. 
I'd love it if they would all come to me as soon as I call them just once. that they would all come running to me and stay woth jist one call.  I would also like it if they all sat when I told them to sit. Am I asking for too much? 

What kind of training tips can you give me?  how best should I look after and treat these dogs.

365,dogs,"Hi!

I'm looking for tips or reassurance or anything that can help. 

I'm so stressed out I almost haven't been able to eat since my boyfriend and I adopted a new dog 3 days ago. The (otherwise extremely nice) dog chased our cats after we did the presentations wrong (we separated the cats but the dog could see them through a glass door and got too excited) so we had to separate them and block the glass door with plastic trash bags. Now the cats won't stop meowing and tapping the door (and I mean WON'T STOP) and I feel extremely anxious regarding the whole situation. Our rescue gave us a 10-to-15-day protocol to introduce our cats to the dog, but it's extremely hard to live with the constant meowing and tapping in the door, and knowing that our beloved cats are going through stress. We let our cats out of their room when we take the dog out for a walk, but we can't let them out during the night because we live in a loft and our bedroom (where the dog sleeps) doesn't have a door. If I go into the cats' room, the dog barks and cries and starts removing the plastic trash bag that covers the window in the door, so I can't go if I'm alone in the apartment (which is often at the moment), but I don't want the cats to get too jealous.

I constantly feel like something is very wrong, and I'm wondering if it was a mistake to adopt the dog, but I desperately do not want to send him back.

Please send help, encouragements, share your experience, anything!

As the title says, I have a westie that I love so much, and I understand he trusts me to make the best decisions for him. But very long story short he's had ups and downs and always bounced back up as hard as he fell. but this time is very different. He is declining. No signs of pain or agony. Or disease that we know of. But he used to go out for his ramble in the garden, pee, poop fine eat great, and drink great. and have his few sniffs, so for a 16-year-old dog. he was doing well. But now, he kind of pee's himself a lot, and no matter how much we wash him he's always smelling of pee :(, he can't really poop unassisted, or else he sits on it (His back legs are very weak.) and even walking he either falls onto his bum or his nose :(. He spends his day mainly in bed. When I know in his eyes he wants to be out rambling.

Sorry if it's poorly written I'm not a good writer. My question is. How do I do it? He's my friend and I don't understand how putting him down (Or Killing him without sugarcoating it, all be it for his ""own good"") is the right thing to do. Even if it is the social norm. I have the belief that life is so precious and an extra day is worth the world. So I'm very lost. I'm 25 and he's 17 so he's all I know, he's gone from being a friend, to a brother to a son (And I really mean it) as he was older and more dependent he was like my child so my heart has formed a bond that will be gut-wrenching to break.

He is a very good boy by the way. And His name is Fred. Freddy :), Any and **ALL** advice is appreciated.

I haven't given my dog cow ears before (didn't even know it was a thing until I was given this one), but I have given her pig ears, so I expected this to be similar, just bigger.

I'm a bit wary on giving my dog a cow ear covered in hair and I'm wondering if that's the appropriate response. A quick google search suggests these are usually de-haired as part of the sanitation process, but I'm not sure if it can be considered unsafe if the hair isn't removed. A few sites suggest a hairy cow ear is totally safe and can be a good natural dewormer, but I'm wary of wary of advice from people suggesting it as a dewormer over, y'know, an actual dewormer (and I'm not here to use it as a dewormer).

In July 2021 Ghost became sick and passed away in August of that year fairly unexpectedly. We were incredibly devastated with his sudden loss and I was depressed for weeks. I wanted another dog in our home as our other dog is old and seemed depressed and lonely too. 

I started looking at puppies, and was really hoping to get a shepherd or a golden retriever. My husband wanted a dog that looked “cool,” so we opted to get another merle aussie as that is what Ghost was. After speaking with a few breeders and looking at dogs that seemed entirely too expensive, we found a woman close to us that had a litter of aussies. My husband agreed to go see them with me (i didn’t plan on making a decision right there) and there was a beautiful make merle aussie. They also had tails, which was a plus for us because Ghost also had a full tail. My husband decided to put a deposit on the puppy, and we picked him up a few weeks later. 

Based on the title you can probably tell this is not a happy, wholesome story. I picked up who would be Duke from the breeder after some lies from her, which were red flags. The breeder lied about getting health certificates, she lied about when she was getting the shots, and lied about why she couldn’t meet earlier. She had initially told me the puppy would get vet check on Friday and we would get him Saturday, but then said something came up Saturday and asked to meet Monday. I agreed on Monday at noon, and she messaged me saying her husband had the car and it had to be later. Turned out to be that she did not take the puppy to the vet until Monday and literally picked him up from vet and brought to me. Idk why she had to lie about it, but she kept making mentions about the vet giving him a clean bill of health. She also did not give us a health certificate, in which case I shouldn’t have accepted the puppy but didn’t want to back away at that point. 

Ever since we got Duke, he has been extremely fearful. I know puppies go through fear stages, and I chalked up most of his reactions to just fear phase and that he would get over it. Over the 15 months we have had him, he has grown more fearful and more neurotic. He is incredibly loving with US, but goes completely crazy with strangers. We have not been able to have people over since we got him. We haven’t been able to take him places or do much with him out of the house. He has one couple he likes who are our dog sitters, and if they are not available then we cannot plan anything.

We worked with a trainer who helped get some of the situation under control. In July my sister came to visit with my godson. We tried to introduce them but Duke would not stop barking aggressively at them, so se tried to walk through the house quickly to go to the yard. I was carrying the baby and my husband was trying to hold Duke, when he lost control and Duke came to me barking which made the baby cry. Duke started crowding me and jumped up and nipped the baby on the foot. I didn’t even realize that was the case until i got outside and saw the blood. We realize this incident could have been avoided with different management, but up until that point he had not bitten and seemed to be doing largely well with his training. 

Since that incident our relationship with Duke has changed. I don’t really feel attached to him or love. I mostly feel annoyance and resentment. I resent that he can’t be a normal dog, or be the dog we intended him to be. I feel guilt for supporting a BYB that breeds unstable dogs. I feel guilt because I feel like I have given up on him. 

I’ve reached out to a few rescues and have largely been told that they cannot take him as he is a bite risk. One rescue agreed to see him after Christmas. The reason for this is that we are moving to Chicago in May. While right now he is manageable as we have a yard, we would not be able to meet his needs in a city because of his reactivity. His sitter last week had a super high energy dog and they romped around for hours and played ball with him and he was STILL running high. There is no way we can meet that in an apartment.",t2_fpl0xqzr,0,Guilt and regret,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zrnkra,True,Outrageous_Tone5613,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zrnkra/guilt_and_regret/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zrnkra/guilt_and_regret/,2473654,1671631915,0,,False,1671631925,1671631926,2022-12-21 14:11:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

378,dogs,"Hello everyone! I was hoping to get some advice from some owners who have maybe experienced their pups developing dementia later in life. I’ve not yet taken my boy to the vet for a discussion about this but I’m thinking it might be time. Bodie is about to turn 9. In the last few months he’s been exhibiting some signs of what I think might be doggy dementia but I’m not totally sure. I’ve tried training with him, which usually has been effective in the past, but it has not helped to remedy the behaviors this time around. 

Lately he’s been very clingy, follows me everywhere I go. If I’m not in the same room as him he cries nonstop until I re-enter the room or he figures out where I’ve gone and comes to me. The crying is constant otherwise. Sometimes he will cry even when I’m in the same room. 

He’s also restless. Not specifically in a sundowning kind of way, but he takes a long time to settle. It seems like he can’t get comfortable unless he’s on the couch in the living room. And even then once he’s up there he’ll cry for 5-10 minutes before he settles down. 

He’s also having some feeding issues. His appetite has definitely decreased as he’s gotten older but now he’s also having trouble remembering that I’ve put his food down is the best way I can put it. He’ll eat a little bit, then go lie down. After a few minutes he’s crying and frantically searching for me, making a fuss until I go down to his food bowl, shake it, and show him that it’s there for him. 

He’s still responsive to commands and enjoys going outside and on walks, but it seems like he gets sensory overload when we’re out sometimes. He’ll get distracted really easily now and is very apprehensive about deviating from any of our normal routes.

As a happy dog owner, I loved nothing more than spending time with my beloved furry friend. Every day, I looked forward to taking my dog on long walks through the park, playing fetch in the backyard, and cuddling up together on the couch.

My dog was more than just a pet - they were a member of my family, and I loved them with all my heart. I was grateful for their unconditional love and companionship, and I knew that they brought joy and happiness into my life every single day.

One of my favorite things to do was to go on adventures with my dog. I loved exploring new trails and hiking through the woods, and my dog was always by my side, wagging their tail and leading the way.

No matter what kind of day I was having, my dog was always there to lift my spirits and make me smile. They were the best friend I could ask for, and I knew that I was lucky to have them in my life.

As the years went by, my bond with my dog only grew stronger. I knew that we would always be there for each other, no matter what, and that was the happiest feeling in the world.

Corgi and chihuahua mixed(yeah it's kinda weird mix haha). A month ago she didn't pee for 1 day and I sent her to ER. They did insert a catheter on her and did some exam and looks like she had some problem with her spine and bones. After that she's been good but as day goes by, she starts to deteriorate, crying when I lift her up due to she is having a hard time standing up. 2 days ago doesn't eat anymore even if I feed her using my hand but she still drinks water.

I told to my girlfriend that maybe it's her time already. I took her outside while carrying her because she is really weak like a dead vegetable. I put her on the spots on our front yard that she usually go when she goes outside. Spent atleast 15 mins because it's kinda cold. Took her back to her bed and i told her that "" i'm ready if you want to go now, it's hard to see you suffer"". After that she starts crying like grasping for air then she will stop if I pet her. So I did pet her if she cries from 7pm until 2am then she starts to gasp air without crying. From that moment, i knew already that it's the final moment and  I started crying. 

It hurts seeing your love one on their final moment specially while they are gasping for air. 

I feel like she is just waiting for me to take her outside for one last time and tell her that i'm ready.  I'm glad I did take her outside and I was with her on her final moments. 

It hurts so bad like it's crushing me. I didn't know that this will hurt a lot. I don't know how to cope with this loss. My life is not the same anymore without her. I miss her already.

Need some advice for my 2 &amp; 1/2 year old Staff/Lurcher. Neutered. Rescue from cyprus. As far as we know had  nice home, but was let out on the streets due to the family's finances, so he was homeless for a day or so.

He's a really loving dog with people, and plays amazingly with dogs, but every now and then, he'll just go for the biggest youngest intact male dog in the park and aggress them.

Thankfully he's never done any damage (but obviously like any dog has the potential), it's very stressful and scary when it happens, but happens so randomly it's so hard to gauge . Sometimes he's totally cool with intact male dogs.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What kind of training would you recommend for this?

406,dogs,"Hello to all,

&amp;#x200B;

5 days ago I adopted my 6 years old dog, since the first day she didn't want to eat or drink anything and we took her to the vet to give her probiotics and some medicines because she had stomach problems. She has leismania so she has to take a pill every 12h and she doesn't like them at all so I try to camouflage them with meat paste for dogs or sausages but it's very difficult because most of the time she refuses to eat it or you have to be with her for half an hour to get her to take a bite, I also want to comment that she only pees.

Someone has lived the same experience or knows someone that has happened to her, I am quite afraid of her not taking her pill because it can get worse and I don't want her to go back to the shelter because I love her madly and I don't want to be separated from her but I have only been with her for 5 days and I have already spent almost all my salary and I have had to sacrifice some expenses to be able to afford her treatment at the vet's. I have already spent a lot of money and I have had to sacrifice some expenses to be able to afford her treatment at the vet.

My mom has a Maltese who is almost 8 years old. She is my moms dog, and I don’t really spend time with her often, so whenever I go over to my moms house the dog often ignores me. However recently, she has started to run over to me out of nowhere and does not stop clawing at me until I start petting her stomach. When I stop, she whines and scratches until I start again. When I do itch her stomach, her muscles tense up and she arches her back a little. She also rubs her butt into my leg whilst I scratch her belly. Is this normal? It kind of started out of nowhere, and she never really gave me attention until recently (only because of the belly scratching thing) and now she jumps around and whines nonstop when I’m not petting her.

It’s worth noting she’s a pretty quiet and mopey dog, so that’s why this random change was odd. Also, emphasis on the arching back thing. She goes in the same position she does when she poops and becomes really tense whenever I rub her stomach, but she likes getting her stomach rubbed because she gets all excited when I stop and licks and scratches me",t2_rwthdco9,0,Recent odd changes in my dogs behavior,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zrfjt0,True,ExpressHair6545,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zrfjt0/recent_odd_changes_in_my_dogs_behavior/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zrfjt0/recent_odd_changes_in_my_dogs_behavior/,2473594,1671614870,0,,False,1671614883,1671614884,2022-12-21 09:27:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A while back, I read somewhere that sauerkraut has some pretty good health benefits for dogs. Me, being someone that always likes to find fresh and healthy dog food additives, decided to try it.

I added a little to her kibble one morning, not really expecting much since sauerkraut is pretty strong smelling, and, well SOUR. I thought that she would lick it up and spit it out or something.

But after one lick of it, she horked that shit down like it was the best thing she's ever eaten.

Ever since then, I've used sauerkraut as treats, food toppers, etc. She even gets excited when I open the jar now. 

It's also the only foolproof way I've been able to get her to take pills/medicine. I've tried peanut butter, almond butter, wet dog food, yogurt, cheese, pill pocket treats, pretty much anything you can think of. She always ends up spitting out the pill or eating around it. But, wrap that baby with a bit of sauerkraut, and down the hatch she goes. No second thoughts.

416,dogs,"My friend has two dogs, one is a 4 year old full sized poodle she's had since it was born and the other is a 2 year old lab she adopted a couple months ago. Both are very well trained dogs. The poodle is calm and gentle and barely barks unless something is really wrong. Both are very friendly and playful, especially the lab. But last night both dogs went crazy. They both were growling and barking at the door. The poodle was aggressively jumping at and clawing the door. These dogs literally never once had this reaction, ever. These dogs usually don't mind if someone is at the door. The lab sometimes barks if someone knocks or rings the doorbell, but the poodle almost always ignores it.

We both looked out the window  and didn't see anything or anyone, and her motion activated lights didn't turn on either. She has a fenced in yard, so she felt comfortable to open the door. The lab surprisingly stayed inside and nearly immediately calmed back down. But the poodle sprinted outside, ran around the porch, barking, then just stood by the front door in an offensive stance and just growled and had that look like she was about to kill something. Normally she wouldn't hurt a fly. My friend was able to calm it down and bring it back inside. Both the poodle and lab were fine the rest of the night.

My friend even checked her doorbell camera and there was nothing. She could hear when the dogs started barking and there was nothing outside the door. The motion activated lights never turned on either.

The dogs are their normal selves now, but this kinda freaked out my friend. She's literally never seen these dogs show any aggression before and they both went crazy over nothing. If it was just one dog, she wouldn't worry about it too much, but it was both of them.

Have any of you seen anything like this? Should she have this looked into? Thanks.",t2_a5ij0,0,"The strangest thing happened with my friend's two dogs.

418,dogs,"Yesterday at the dog park my puppy (10 mo) suddenly got spooked by something on the other side of the fence were the small dogs side is. She kept barking non-stop and refusing to turn her back towards the fence. You could barely see the fence and definitely not see anything behind the fence from where she mostly barked at it. She didn't listen to any commands, refused to even notice treats even when right in front of her and tried to see around me every time I put myself between her and her line of sight to the fence. Only positive thing was that when I moved away from the fence she retreated with me which meant we could easily leave (gate is at exact opposite corner of the park from where she was barking at).  


On the way home she was a bit jumpy and kept being vary of the left side (where the area she barked at is but not visible due to forest) and once we passed it she kept looking over her shoulder. When we got home she was really tense and it took her a while to calm down. Hours later when I went to sleep she came to sleep in bed right next to me, which is strange cause she almost never sleeps in the bed at night and if she does never right next to me.   


I still have no idea what happened, what she was barking at and this is really unusual behavior of her since she rarely barks normally. She was playing with her friend near the fence like they always do and suddenly came back and started barking. Her body was stiff and her pointed ears where turned outwards, her hackles was a bit raised but not fully like they would be when she normally is scared.  


Went to have a peak on the other side of the fence and three tiny dogs where far away on the other side mostly not even barking. One of the dogs had a really bright blinking red light that created an aura of red in front of that dog, but my dog hasn't normally shown fear towards lights. It was also dark  like night time outside which made it harder to see things.

420,dogs,"So I tried to fly with my dog today for the first time and was resoundingly rejected at the check-in counter and Im wondering if people have any advice on this kind of situation. 

My dog is small but weirdly shaped - hes only 18 pounds, but he’s REALLY fluffy, and kind of leggy. When he’s wet, he’s about the size of a big boned cat, but people assume he’s a lot bigger than he actually is, so I knew going into this that there might be some convincing. I promise I did not go into this overconfident or naive! I did a lot of research into carriers and looked at a lot of photos and accounts of dogs objectively much bigger than mine flying without any issues. My sister’s dog, a tall terrier mix, who is much bigger than my dog but not as fluffy, has flown without issue in the same carrier I use. I’ve also taken my dog in his carrier on the train without issue. He fits in the carrier and can spin around and roll over, although he cant fully stand. I know that the airlines say dogs must be able to fully stand but I also know that the standing rule isn’t consistently enforced, and that generally they just want to make sure the dog can move around. Many of my friends with small but not tiny dogs have flown successfully with them, even when they cant fully stand. So I was anxious but reasonably confident that everything would be fine! 

But WOW was I wrong. I didnt even fully walk up to the check-in counter before the woman working there said “oh yeah no, theres no way you’re bringing that dog.” I was so flabbergasted!!! Especially bc I had literally just watched someone with a small corgi successfully check in! No amount of cajoling or demonstrating that he could move freely or anything worked, and she even brought her supervisor over specifically to tell me off and then they both laughed at me. It was honestly bizarrely hostile and I was so taken aback and didnt really know what to do! The weirdest part was when she offered to rebook me without the dog and was surprised when I said no like… why would I do that? I ended up taking a flight credit and going back home in shame. I know airline workers are super underpaid and overworked, especially at this time of year, but holy moly. 

I guess my question is: those of you with small-but-not-tiny dogs: how do you fly with them? am i missing some secret persuasion strategy or was this just random bad luck? Is there something I should do differently? Or am I just completely delusional and should never try again?

428,dogs,"Me (27M) and my GF (27F) are soon to be engaged, we will be moving to a more pet friendly home sometime middle of next year. We plan to rent a single family home, not a duplex, with a small yard, and we are getting a dog.

She has never owned a pet, and I grew up with a poorly trained devil of a miniature shih-tzu. I also fell in love with my sister's border collie a while ago and watched him a lot after he was trained.

Situation:
1. We work from home, we will be around a lot
2. We live in the city, not a lot of land to run around on
3.  It gets extremely cold for around half the year - dog must be able to be inside a lot
4. We are semi-active in the summer, lots of walks and runs around the city
5. She cares more about shedding and allergies than I do, so we agreed it does not need to be 100% hypoallergenic but it should be sort of light on the shedding - so can't really be a border collie at this rate, but that's ok
6. Ideally the dog is medium/medium-small - we are small people

We have landed on a couple ideas, but neither of us have owned a dog ourselves so we're looking for something smart for our situation.

Ideas:
1. Corgi - any kind that best adapts to homebody, semi-active, city living, winters
2. Schipperke - I found out about this dog during research and fell in love, it seemed like some form of mini border collie. I also found a breeder near us who seems to genuinely love her dogs. If it's not right for us then I'll avoid it - I was having difficulty finding info about this breed
3. Golden Doodle - ugh I don't really like these kinds of dogs but they are hypoallergenic
4. Adopting whatever we find at a shelter",t2_sqozakd,0,"Dog recommendations?

429,dogs,"(TW: talk of pet loss)

It's been three weeks since we had let go of my lovey– she was my dog for sixteen years, and I couldn't have loved her more than I did. It still feels like a disillusion from reality– I know she's gone, I was there when she went, and yet every time I visit my house (note: I live in an apartment– she lived with my family after I moved out and I would go over at least once a week), I still wait for her to come running. It's so hard, but I am doing better than I thought. Grief creeps in in mysterious ways. 

The only people who are taking this as hard as me is my mom. I called my lovey my baby, but she was equally, if not more so, my mom's. My mom was her favorite person– they were always together, and having her gone has been a big loss of structure for my mom. She's been crying on and off since it happened, thinks of her every moment, and I know she's hurting. Days after, she told me in a year or two, maybe they would consider another dog, but for now, the thought was too painful. Little did I know, she's been looking at pups online for a few days. 

My mom called me tonight with a link to the sweetest-looking pup. It's the type of dog she wants, in an area not far from where we live, and this sweetie was born on my lovey's birthday (9/28). My lovey was a Christmas present, so this little honey would be about the same age we got her too. My mom has been looking for signs since my lovey passed, and she saw this pup and instantly wanted to meet her. She's talking about going tomorrow and my dad wants to go with her.

I have my own opinions: I think it's far too soon, and while I know she misses the companionship she had with my lovey, I don't want to see her hurt over the emotions bringing a new family member home would initiate while trying to mourn another. I've made it very clear that any future dog they'd get wouldn't be mine– I had a dog, and she was perfect in my eyes. But I would love to see them happy again.

430,dogs,"So the family’s reason for rehoming the dog was that they initially got him to breed with thier other golden and upon DNA testing, “they said” he has the trait for ichthyosis that can be passed down to the offspring. Additionally, they have a newborn and two children under 7 and said that 2 dogs is too much for them right now. They specifically told us he doesn’t have the disease himself. 

Upon rehoming him, we have recently noticed sores on his neck that haven’t gotten better since. My questions are: could these people have been lying to us and he actually has ichthyosis?

I live in the Midwest where we are expecting to see the wind chill temperatures dip as low as -26 Fahrenheit for a few days. I have a 10 year old pitbull who is a very chilly guy even when it’s reasonable outside. 

My question is, how do I go about taking my dog outside to go to the bathroom when the temperatures are at frostbite lows? Is it acceptable to bundle him up or is there just absolutely no going outside during this? How are other pet owners planning to handle this situation?

A few things to note:
-He refuses to poop in our (very small) yard. We typically have to be a block from the house before he will go. 
-He will not use a potty pad as he’s never had to use them and is confused about what they’re for.

443,dogs,"So I have an absolutely awesome dog, about 7 years old. I’ve had him for about 2 years but known him his whole life. He’s an American bulldog, Great Pyrenees mix. He’s a protective, territorial dog that does not trust strangers. But also it doesn’t take long to earn his trust. He’s spent most of his life outside. In fact, all of his life before I got him but now he spends a lot of time in with us. 

He’s kind of unpredictable. He will let strangers pet him then bark/act like he’s going to bite them, but then he doesn’t ever bite. He’s had plenty of opportunities to. It’s pretty spooky though. Give him a couple milk bones and you aren’t a stranger anymore, it’s all good. 

He rarely barks, doesn’t growl, doesn’t whine, generally nonvocal. 

Now that I’ve kind of explained the dog, I cannot get a gauge on his prey drive or if he would be aggressive with cats. He was around a cat when he was a tiny puppy but that’s it. He’s always been a solo dog. I have 2 cats that we always keep separate from him. He will try to go towards them but we restrain him. He doesn’t growl at them, doesn’t bark at them. But he’s also not wagging his tail at them either. 

Google isn’t helping me. The dog is almost always shaking his front leg, usually due to excitement. He’s always licking his lips. He will kind of fixate on them but never more than a couple seconds, then he seems to ignore them. He doesn’t really stiffen up but he does get still when he looks at them sometimes. He never growls, never barks.  

Are there any telltale signs that are a dead giveaway? Has anybody ever come across any sort of training programs to either socialize a dog with cats or determine aggression towards cats? He’s so subtle that I’m afraid he’ll just snap on one of them.

I'm looking for the perfect Christmas or potentially early birthday present for my significant other. We already have a dog cam for the living room with 2-way audio. But what I know would really make her happy would be to have a product that utilizes 2-way video. Knowing that her dog would be able to see her face would be the only thing better. 

Anyway am kind of surprised that a product like this doesn't already exist en mass on the market. From my own research the only one that I could find was a brand called Petchatz. But the product is universally unavailable. In addition there was a product by the name of Guuluu if I'm not mistaken as a kickstarter but was recently cancelled. 

If anyone can suggest a work around or an alternative to accomplish this goal I'd be very pleased. Someone that I spoke to suggested getting an ipad for facetime but to my knowledge there is no current feature that would allow auto answering without human interaction directly. 

Could there possibly be an existing app that I could load onto a purchased iPad to accomplish this goal of 2-way audio visual pet communication?

My 13 year-old lab/terrier mix, Sandy, has been diagnosed positive with heartworms.

Sandy has moderate arthritis, but is otherwise in good health. We go for 1-2 hour walks everyday. She has LOTS of energy.

I really don't know what to do. I try to weight the pros &amp; cons of each option:

Slow-Kill : I'll have to restrict Sandy's activity for 1-2 years, which is likely the rest of her life.

Fast-kill : receive painful melarsomine shots, and restrict her activity for about a year.

No treatment : basically let the heartworms kill her, which may take 1-2 years or more.

457,dogs,"I (22 F) got a dog about 1.5 years ago and everyone I live with (except my mom) can’t stand my dog. The day I bought my dog my brother  (19 M) told me to “get rid of it” and hasn’t changed much since then. For the longest time he told me to get rid of my dog every chance he got to talk to me, and has now completely stopped talking to me because of it. He has threatened to move in with our grandmother because of my dog. So apparently my dog is so bad that he wants to leave home. 

I will admit the first couple months I had my dog, while she was still untrained, she did annoy a lot of people including me with her jumping and barking. However, since I’ve trained her she doesn’t bark unless I want her to and she doesn’t really jump on anyone anymore (unless they’re provoking her, but then it’s easy for me to get her to stop). 
He also said he doesn’t want the dog because when I vacuum his socks from the hair some of them went missing one time and he’ll “never be able to get them back”. 
I originally got my dog because I was suffering from anxiety and depression. When I got her I wanted to kill myself, and since getting her I’m not as suicidal. It will tear me apart to get rid of my dog. And I can’t believe I’m actually considering it for my brother. 
Am I being an asshole or is he just immature? Should I really get rid of my dog even if it will destroy me?

473,dogs,"Hey guys! Hoping you could help me determine what breed is best for my circumstances? I've had cats all my life (not currently), now as an adult I live a much more active lifestyle and would love a companion to take along with me. I live in an apartment, but my complex does have its own dog park, and there's a large grassy park right around the corner as well. On weekends I typically go for one or two 5-7 mile hikes, I run a few miles daily, and like to go exploring whether it be beaches or mountains, so essentially I'm looking for a pup who's always up for adventures. Since this is my first dog, I'd like a breed with a mellow demeanor who's not extremely difficult to train, preferably not a yapper (apartment life), but not so small that he can't keep up, so right around 15-25lbs is perfect. Hypoallergenic or low shed is a plus.

475,dogs,"Since the day my family got our dog I have insisted that they take him somewhere to be trained. Almost any dog could snap but I feel that unless you have experience training dogs, if you have a very large dog like ours- it’s important/essential for them to get professionally trained. My step dad has taught him to sit, stay and paw but I think there is much more to training than tricks. I am the eldest sister (22 yo) in the family, and I am now moved out. I have been concerned for a while about the family dog. (I do also suffer from severe paranoid thoughts that are more active sometimes and less active during others.) I adore this dog. He has a great temperament with humans and shows more patience with kids than any other animal I have ever seen. They let my little siblings (3yo &amp; 7yo) around the dog freely. This makes me uncomfortable as he is indoors the majority of the time now. They trust that he wont snap, since again- He has shown time and time again that he is significantly patient with people. 

However, our family dog has killed 2 dogs and a cat.  One of the dogs wandered through our front yard fence and the other was one of his puppies. This was years ago and since then, we have switched fences so a small stray dog wandering through our fence again would be impossible. He’s also been fixed, so no more puppies. After he killed the stray dog that wandered through our fence, I refused to touch him or even look at him for years until this last month. I’ve been trying since it’s been four years, and I do truly love him. 

Now, I figure that he was protecting his territory but I can’t help but fear that one day out of nowhere he could snap and attack one of my baby siblings. I’ve brought this up over and over again to my parents but they just don’t listen. They brush it off completely and boil it down to me being overly paranoid. I can’t get the thought out of my head that when I pet him he could turn around and rip my face off or even worse, one of the kids. I’m extra aware and I watch for signs of aggression (which he never shows) every time I play with him or touch him. This Rottweiler is HUGE but then again we’ve had him for 8 years, 4 years accident free and he’s never shown aggression towards a human. Please tell me if I’m just getting overly paranoid recently or if there are any grounds to my concerns.

477,dogs,"Looking for support, perspective, and open to any advice you may have. 

My boyfriend and I moved in together the very end of November/first few days of December. Between us we have 5 dogs. My two are a yorkie/schnauzer mix and a chiweenie. His three dogs include a retriever/chow mix, a wired haired terrier mix, and a husky. I had a cat that we had been keeping separate and we had her in the guest bedroom.

About a week ago one of my boyfriends dogs, the husky, tore through the wooden door to the guest room and killed my cat. 

We were not home at the time but could tell he was the only dog who partook in the incident. From what my boyfriend could tell it wasn’t an act of violence necessarily. It appeared as if he viewed her as a toy. I don’t have many details as it was cleaned up by the time I got home.

I am absolutely heartbroken, and feel terrible about what happened to her.￼ If I could take it all back and never put her in that ￼situation I would. 

Here is where the biggest issue begins: My boyfriend and I cannot get on the same page about what to do about this dog. I want him out of the house and rehomed because I’m not sure I can live with this dog. I’m afraid for the safety of my two small dogs when we’re not there, and so far, I haven’t left them home alone with him since. He has a fascination with my chiweenie and will often fixate on her and chase her randomly until we stop him. And if I’m being honest, I kind of fucking hate the dog. I have worked with animals my whole adult life and I can’t believe that I can say that about an animal.

My boyfriend takes responsibility for the fact that this dog is severely under stimulated on a daily basis and has very little training. He is generally a good dog (not aggressive) but will completely ignore your commands. In my opinion, this is not a suitable home for a husky. The house doesn’t have a fenced in yard, and ￼we don’t take them on walks or get them physical exercise. This dog stays home almost all day every day.

Since the incident, my boyfriend said that he would get the husky the exercise he needs mentally and physically. But nothing has changed.

I think we need to rehome this dog to someone without any small animals. I’m terrified he will try to reenact what he did to my cat with another animal as I am sure he saw it as very fun and stimulating. My boyfriend would rather kill him than rehome him. He views rehoming him as giving up on him.
￼

481,dogs,"I'm temporarily staying at an extended-stay hotel with my mom until renovations are done to save money. I'm a kennel tech at a large animal hospital. I don't have any bills except a car payment. I work 10-hour shifts 3 days a week and doggy daycare and day boarding are free for employees. 

I've struggled with anxiety for some years and I've discussed having an emotional support dog with my therapist (I'm allergic to cats, unfortunately) due to realizing my childhood black lab, Chloe had been acting as my support unknowingly until she passed away. I got swallowed by anxiety after that. So I can have an ESA. The property manager only allows ESAs and service animals. And I've talked with him extensively about it he loves dogs too (and I've seen other ESA and service animals around as well) so there are no problems there.

I've been researching adopting (not breeders because I'm not ready to train a puppy as my first solo pet) and I'm kinda concerned it won't be possible for me because of how extremely strict rescues are. I see that people with apartments are rejected for not having a yard with a fence. 

Obviously, a two-room suite is smaller than an apartment but we're very minimalist so we don't have a bunch of our stuff here in a cluttered mess so there's a fair amount of open space. 

I'm fairly active. I walk the trail at the park and I started hiking with my friends. But even with that, I'm not looking for a high-energy dog or herding dog. Although my dream dog would be a border collie or a GSP but that's for the future. I'm actually looking for a small dog (I do have a bias for Chihuahuas because of my friend's dog) and preferably older/senior.

I've been doing a lot of reading about how many have nightmare stories about being ideal for a dog and being rejected everywhere. 

I know I'm no match to homeowners but it's temporary and most of the space is dedicated to the dog. I thought it would go for the dog to get to know me and trust us before we all move to a space that going to be new for everybody. 

I, personally, feel like I'm not asking too much. I don't want a puppy. I don't want anything so large there won't be room for them. I'm active. I work with dogs all day so my dog would never be left at home alone while I'm working. I haven't had any pets in some years but I work with ten veterinarians that could be my references (if that's what vet references are). I've been so excited about the idea of finally getting another dog again, I've spent two weeks watching and reading reviews on high-quality dog food, I already have cute collars and harnesses, and bandanas in my amazon cart and I'm resisting buying them right this moment. 

I'm looking for small and older and likely good with other dogs (my friends bring their dogs when we go to dog-friendly places - Corgi, Shihpoo, and Chihuahua)

we came back and got him nine days afterwards, aka yesterday, and i’m worried he might be upset with us. he didn’t kiss my dad as much as he usually does when he comes home, hasn’t seemed that excited, but overall is still a good boy. it’s like he’s happy to see us back, but also slightly still upset that we left him. i sound insane.

491,dogs,"Hey! My family has been talking about our next dog and while I've been doing a bunch of research, I wanted to check in to make sure that I hadn’t missed any other potential breeds and get some insight on the breeds that I have been looking into. 

I felt like my answers to the breed questionnaire got slightly repetitive, so I tried to summarize them a bit here (but have added the full version in the comments). 

Ideally, we’re after a breed that would make a good short-distance (1-15 miles) hiking and walking companion and is between approximately 30 and 70 pounds. Needs to have the potential to also be a good house dog without being a total velcro dog, be good with cats, and is either a quieter breed or can be trained out of excessive barking. 

One person in the house is interested in gundogs, specifically for the purpose of being a hunting dog, but none of the breeds felt like they would otherwise be a good fit? Plus, while we’ve talked about starting, we don’t currently hunt, and I worry that we would be getting a dog without actually having the lifestyle for it. 

While we aren’t interested in doing anything competitively, we are open to getting involved in dog sports for enrichment purposes. Other than that, we can commit to at least one long walk a day, have a fully fenced backyard, at least three dog parks within easy walking distance, and semi-regular hiking trips. 

Currently, our top three breed choices are: 

* **Silken Windhounds**: described as usually fairly mellow, but still happy to go on a hike. don’t tend towards being excessive barkers, can be alright with cats if socialized well, and are fairly cuddly. Honestly from everything I’ve read, these seem like they’d be an absolutely wonderful fit. The only downside is that one person in the house would definitely prefer a more eager-to-please breed, but that might be a trait we could just stress being interested in to the breeder?  
* **Rough or Smooth Collie**: described as very family-oriented, affectionate, and playful. potentially a better hiking companion option, and more likely to have a stronger recall. can do well with cats if socialized properly. slightly worried about the barking, but totally willing to put the time into working on training on this. 
* **Chodský Pes/Bohemian Shepherd**: absolutely in love with the sound of these, but they seem almost impossible to find in the United States and we would definitely want to be able to meet some owners of the breed before getting a dog. Would be open to other medium energy shepherd breeds of similar temperament (stable, calm, friendly, excellent family dog) if that matches any other breeds out there!

Are there any other breeds that might be a good fit?

497,dogs,"Hello all! I started fostering dogs this past January. So far this year, I’ve fostered seven dogs at my house and many dogs with my coworkers (we work at a boarding facility so we will often team up to foster litters of puppies). I’m going to meet a dog tomorrow to foster who has had a lot of trouble keeping on weight. This is definitely my most fragile foster yet, and all my fosters up until now have been short term and we’re not sure how long our new foster will be with us. She’s been in the shelter almost a year (313 days now :() and they believe the shelter environment is the cause of her weight loss. She has gained weight when she had friends but when they were adopted, she regressed. They say the vet can’t find any underlying medical causes and they have tried all sorts of things, including really expensive pancreas enzymes to encourage weight gain but she just seems too stressed. She looks severely underweight from her pictures.

Obviously my goal with fostering her is that she can get to a healthy weight once she’s in a better environment. Of course I’ll be working with the animal shelter and figuring out if there’s anything she can’t have tomorrow and what they have her on now. In the meantime, I’d like to brainstorm some high calorie treats I can give her as she adjusts to the home.

506,dogs,"Hi all, wanted some perspective here. 

I lost my dog a few months ago, she was 13 and suddenly passed. She had numerous health issues the last few years of her life but her death was quite sudden. 

After she passed, I decided I would foster. I got all these ads on instagram for a International dog rescue and they were looking for fosters. It felt like the right time and I decided to sign up. I filled out a questionnaire and they said they had an 8 year old dog I could foster, he would be arriving in a few weeks. I asked a bunch of questions, seems he had been in a bunch of foster homes in Korea, and I felt okay and comfortable. 

Then they told me he got adopted, but asked if I would be comfortable taking in a puppy (10 months). I said sure. I should have asked more questions but I assumed it was a similar situation, the dog was being fostered in Korea and would be coming here. 

I got an email with pickup instructions, a signed agreement, and that’s pretty much it. I did some additional research into puppy training but I didn’t look into research about rescues specifically because I had wrongly assumed they would provide all the info i needed. 

We brought the puppy home and she escaped from our fenced in backyard. She was an escape artist and escaped the backyard my old dog never did. Thankful we were able to bring her home (through the help of a dog tracker and other volunteers who help search for missing dogs) and the organization took her to the vet and told me I could pick her up after the vet gave her an all clear. The person from the organization asked me if I was still okay with fostering and I said yes but I was nervous about her escaping again. They then asked me if I got their adoption guide, and I said no. She sent it over and it had so much information about the first few weeks with your foster dog. But they never sent me this originally.  

Here’s where I get a little skeptical of how they handled this. The dog was in a wooded area and hiding on farms. I wondered if they had done any tests for parasites or anything beyond the surface level because as soon as they were done with the appointment they said she was given an all clear. 

In the end, she said that it was probably best for the dog to not be moved around and she seemed to be fine with her. I agreed and figured that they would be helping train her and not have her available for foster or adoption (at least not any time soon) because she seemed pretty traumatized, not just by the escape but by the flight. She was a very skittish dog in general. The dog tracker said that she would always be a flight risk and would need two leashes forever. This is a dog that would need a lot more support than your usual foster dog. I looked on their IG, the dog has been given to a new foster and is up for adoption now.

Now given the dog escaping from my care, I don’t blame them for not entrusting me with her again. But the fact the dog is up for adoption and is in a new foster home makes me sceptical they have the dogs best interests in mind. Im worried that all of this won’t be disclosed and the foster/future adopter have no idea what kind of dog they’re signing up to adopt because there was no info about this in the dogs profile.

509,dogs,"My 1-yo Bernedoodle has been living in the same apartment building the past 8 months. We walk through the building at least 3 times a day, to use the dog run, go over to our friends, and/or community areas.

About four days ago, he started hiding, running away, and behaving anxiously around the HVAC vents, elevator (whirring), and the dog run cleaning machine which sounds exactly like our HVAC vents. He still sleeps on the bed at night, but escapes every \~hour when the HVAC kicks in, then returns when it's off. 

What's weird is that on the day he started expressing this behavior (in the afternoon) he went potty, as excited and bubbly, the same morning.

I've asked many other dog owners (live in Seattle so every other person has a dog) but none of them reported remotely similar behavior. I've also checked with the maintenance team, but nothing has changed in our building.

Last year, she developed a bunch of growths along her stomach. Within the last couple of months, she's gone mostly deaf and mostly blind.

Thankfully he's never done any damage, but it looks really scary, and obviously is very stressful for everyone. It's one of those things that we can go ages with no event, and then it just seems to happen randomly. And sometimes he's perfectly fine playing with intact males.

For those who've been in this situation before, what are your tips? Should I just have him muzzled all the time off lead if it's a public park at the moment until we can see a behaviourist?

- Deaf
- Can’t stand or walk. She tries to but either her paws slip outward or she stumbles and falls over
- little control of her bowels
- can’t finish her food without being spoon fed
- hasn’t wagged her tail in almost a year
- spends her days sleeping, trying to eat, or trying to stand
- my family doesn’t help her eat (I do, but I work full time so I’m not around for most of the day), so she constantly gets dried crusted food stuck on her face and snout for days

My family refuses to do anything. I brought up putting her down and they acted like I’m so incredibly cruel for even suggesting this.

I would just need to say ""Kennel Time!"" and they would happily run into their crates and patiently sit or lay waiting on a little treat.  These brothers are 13 lbs, the small one, and 39 lbs, the big one. They have separate crates right next to each other. The black wire ones.  

Something must have happened recently because the big one no longer wants to go in his crate. He won't even follow  me when I have treats. I manage to coax him off the couch then sort of push him across the floor as he half-walks / half slides to the crate. I know I'm making it worse doing this. Instead of a place of comfort and safety it seems like I'm turning it into a punishment and I hate that I'm putting him through that. Once he's in the crate, it's all chill. He gets his treat and lays down. I get home from work and he chill.  

Even though they are generally good dogs, they have a couple of bad habits I could never break. Like chewing / eating drywall.  So I have to put them in their crates when I leave the house.

I've washed all his bedding and cleaned things up a bit. It wasn't dirty. I just didn't know what else to do. I just cannot image what happened to make him like this. then I'm not sure what to do to get him to want to go in there again.

527,dogs,"I’m having a difficult time, finding a routine that works in getting to the gym early in the morning. Right at the beginning of the day is the only time that I can feasibly go to the gym for many reasons and not going is not an option for my mental health. I am struggling to get out the door in the morning with my one year old puppy, who has minor separation anxiety. His main symptom is just not eating or chewing on toys/ food and occasional panting when I am clearly leaving in a rush/forgot something inside/ or misplaced my phone, etc (i have ADHD), for no longer than 4 minutes complete duration after I leave, but the not eating food usually goes until i come back. Understandably but frustratingly, his SA symptoms are way worse in the mornings right away, before he has had any activity or exercise. 

Does anybody go to the gym in the morning right away and have any suggestions? 

Sincerely, there is no other alternative time for me to go to the gym in the morning. I have been unable to go for months now and my mental health is tanking drastically, which is in turn causing me to be less interactive with him throughout the day and less able to provide adequate activities and stimulation, less able to care for myself and keep the house clean, etc. 


Not sure if this is too much info but he sleeps 30% on the bed with me, 70% in his crate at night in my room. During the day when I leave he is crated in a small playpen in the living room with a blanket roof and curtains that is maybe twice the size of his bedtime crate. 

I am wondering if this multi-crate situation has something to do with anything, as he knows I leave when he is in the living room playpen. What am I overlooking? His SA symptom level is equal in each crate/pen. We are doing desensitization with me going in and out/ jangling keys/ positive reinforcement/ etc which has helped a bit…. But I dont want to just leave in the mornings before he is ready for that and cause a back-step in the SA. So i haven’t been to the gym in many months now and I don’t know how much longer i can do this.

She spent 3 years of college with me, moved 4 times with me, travelled with me and never seemed to prefer anyone else to me until I met my current boyfriend nearly 4 years ago. 

I was so happy when she seemed to love him immediately, as sometimes she seemed indifferent to new people. And he loved her so much, so I knew it was going to work out between us. We moved in together before a year and shortly after I realized that she REALLY loved my boyfriend. 

She gets so much more excited when he gets home than when I do. She chooses him to cuddle with 9/10 times. If I’m playing with her and he so much as moves, she runs to him to play instead.

531,dogs,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Technically, this will be our first dog, however we've raised an Havanese puppy for 6 months last summer.  To make a long story short, a friend adopted a puppy and could not take care of it, so we raised her for 6 months (from 3 months old to 9 months old).  We were not ready to have a dog and we passed the opportunity to keep her.  That was a mistake since there is not a single day we are not thinking of her.  Her departure left a hole in our family and we have to accept the evidence: we need a dog in our life!

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would like to work with a reputable breeder.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* That havanese puppy was a very good dog for us.  Great with our kids (10 and 12) and with our 2 cats.  Super affectionate and cuddling, with a very calm comportment.  She loved to go to the dog park to play with the neighbourhood dogs.  She rarely barked and was not really shedding.  We would love to have a dog with the same personna but bigger.  My wife and I are active and we would like to go for runs (2-3 miles) with the dog.  This was a bit too much for an Havanese I think.  So a medium size dog would be good.  We also live in Quebec, so snowy winters, temperatures from something like -10F to 90F and we go out no matter what ;-)

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We are open to many breeds, but Medium in size.   (But *not* the following breeds, as they are forbidden in our city: Bull-terrier, Staffordshire Bull-terrier, American Bull-terrier or American Staffordshire Terrier)

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience, like puppy school thing.  Walk and run with us.  Fetch the ball, hold, keep away from dining table at meal time.  Nothing fancy.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No.  Except going for a run/jog.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2h per day at minimum.  But from our experience, between the four of us in the family, the dog had much more time devoted to her.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* With the dog we had last summer, we were going our for a long walk in the morning and at night plus 2-3 shorter ones during the day.  If the dog would be able to cope with it, one of those long walk would be replaced ideally by a 2-3 miles run.  We were visiting the dog park almost daily to play and interact with other dogs.   

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Basic grooming can be done at home, on a weekly basis, and a visit to a professionnal when needed.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium.  Bigger than havanese, no bigger than a Lab.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Low shedding, ideally, but we already have 2 cats at home....  so we are use to some.  Low barking, although we do not mind a bark from time to time.  And slobber.....  erk, none please :-)

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not really important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly :-). Havanese were velcro dogs, always there around, so it is good with us.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* No preference, really.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Neutral/independant.  Not scared, not over protective/agressive.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Can't think of any,.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Very little.  We both work from home, so we can arrange that there is always someone at home.  We may leave the dog from time to time for 1-2 hours, but infrequently.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* MY wife and I will be the main carers.  Kids will help.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 2 cats.  No other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, 10 and 12.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a separate house in the suburbs with a medium yard.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Suburb of Montreal, Canada.  Following breeds are forbidden: Bull-terrier, Staffordshire Bull-terrier, American Bull-terrier or American Staffordshire Terrier

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*  Cold climate in winter with lots of snow.  Rather hot in summer.   Let say from -15F (sometimes colder) to +85F (sometimes hotter)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Can't think of any.

534,dogs,"My husband and I (30s M/F) have a well-behaved but friendly dog who loves all people. We have family in the area who visit often but are not “animal people,” to the point they are bothered by normal dog behaviors (sniffing legs when they enter the house, lying at their feet during dinner). A very recent conversation revealed just how bothersome this is to them.
With the holidays coming, we want to host at our home. While we can and probably will put the dog away in a room for this one event, this is not a long term solution. I know it’s unfair to tell them to “just deal with” something that makes them uncomfortable.

537,dogs," I have been a dog lover/owner my entire life. I’d like to think that I am a decent trainer  as they have all turned out well behaved and happy. Currently, I am temporarily staying at a place for 2.5 months. 
Three weeks ago, I came across a dog that had gotten out while coming home from the park with my own. A very sweet border collie that came right to me when called. Returned to the owner only to find that she was approximately 90 years old and in a walker. She said the dog was 7 1/2 years old and she is unable to walk her, but plays with her using a hose in the small concrete backyard. It has been this way since she got the dog as a puppy. 
 I volunteered to take the dog with me twice a day on walks or to the park. The dog is an absolute heaven. Chasing the balls, playing with other dogs at the park, etc. She is just the best, sweetest dog ever. 
Obviously, I feel bad about her situation and need to figure out a way to possibly make this woman. Happy with a small lapdog in exchange to allowing me to keep hers?

541,dogs,"Early last week, I noticed my Pomeranian boy, Chauncey, had been vomiting multiple times over the past day. Around 4pm that day, after I was finished with work, he was noticeably shaky and weak. I immediately took him to the vet where they took x-rays, blood tests and gave him some anti-nausea and pain medicine. The x-ray showed what they thought was a foreign object in his stomach. Because I arrived at the vet an hour before they closed, they didn't administer any IV fluids, which I was expecting they would. Instead, I was told to come back the next day for another x-ray to see if the object had moved. The next day's x-ray still showed the foreign object in his stomach, so surgery was suggested. Even though it was a financial strain, I agreed. After the 11am surgery, the doctor said they couldn't find anything in his stomach, but there was ulcers in his small intestine. He was put on an IV and we were told to pick him up at 4pm. I thought it was odd that they wouldn't keep him overnight to observe him and make sure he was recovering properly. Instead, we were given a slew of medicine (antibiotics, pain meds, anti nausea medicine) and were told try to make him eat anything. That night we took him home and he seemed pretty good. Obviously, a bit loopy from the surgery, but he actually was licking some wet food we bought him. I was pretty confident that he was going to be ok. The next day, he vomited a few times again, so we took him back to the vet. They gave him an IV and meds and he spent most of the day there recovering. He was stable at this point, but still seemed pretty weak and uninterested in food. After the initial x-rays, blood work, surgery, and medicine, I had already spent $4k. I told the vet that I was in a bit of strain financially and was unhappy with the outcome of the surgery that resulted in them not actually finding the foreign object that was in the x-ray. They actually gave me a 50% discount for the treatment and meds they administered that day. The night we got him back from the vet after this day, he was still in rough shape. He wasn't accepting food and we were having trouble forcing him to take his antibiotic medicine orally. He vomited again that night and had one very dark, bloody stool. We decided we'd take him back to the vet again in the morning and see if they had any solutions. The vet gave him an antibiotic shot that would last 2 weeks, since he wasn't able to take them orally. He said his temperature was normal and that we'd just ""have to let nature take its course"", all the while assuring us that he would recover just fine. On his final day, he was very lethargic at home, hiding under our couches and when we took him outside to see if he'd poop, he would just try to dig holes near the corner of our yard (likely an instinct to protect himself since he was so sick). My wife used a syringe of food to force him to eat. It seemed like that was working and he hadn't vomited that day. I thought he was just weak from the surgery still and was trying to keep him in his dog bed to rest. At 9pm that night, he was in his bed and suddenly convulsed out of nowhere. We scrambled, my wife tried to syringe water in his throat in case he was choking and then tried to give him CPR. Nothing worked and he slowly died. The next day, we put him in a chest and buried him in our yard. 

It's been two days and I'm feeling extreme guilt and sadness. I'm left wondering what would have happened if I took him to a more compassionate vet or if I did something wrong when he was being taken care of at our house. I hate that his last moment was us panicking and trying to get him to stay alive. I don't understand why the vet was so confident that he'd recover without any issues. I'm left with no answers on what caused him to get sick initially and what caused him to die so fast.

 I really miss my dog too. I'd take him on an early walk every single morning and he was always so energetic and happy. After our walk, he'd go snuggle with my wife in our bed. We're so sad to lose him, he was our little boy. We got him when we first started dating and been with us on countless road trips and life events. It feels like an end of a joyful era now that came too soon. I can't get over the thought that he should still be around for at least a few more years. He was only 9- it just seems so abrupt and unfair.

543,dogs,"I have a 15 week old golden retriever puppy who is experiencing diarrhea (nothing has changed diet wise previous to this). About 2 weeks ago his stomach was upset and over the course of a couple days it escalated to needing to go to the bathroom 1-2 times per hour and even having accidents in the house (he never had an accident prior to this). His stool was almost straight liquid and mucus, he never threw up, wasn’t lethargic, had his normal appetite and was drinking plenty of water/no signs of dehydration, just the fairly severe case of diarrhea. On the third day we switched him to a boiled chicken and rice diet and gave him some 100% pure canned pumpkin with no fat unflavored green yogurt but after a week we saw no change and took him to the vet. After taking a stool sample and a couple other tests they ruled out parasites and other common issues and came to the conclusion that it was some type of bacterial infection in his gut and prescribed Metronidazole and a Probiotic paste. Within 24 hours he was back to having somewhat solid stool and able to sleep through the night, his energy levels were higher than before and I could tell he was feeling better. After about 3-4 days on the medication I slowly started re-introducing his puppy kibble (mixing in a little with his chicken and rice), this is also around the time the probiotic paste was starting to run out. The issue is that we are starting to notice that his diarrhea is starting to come back, not nearly as severe as before but every other poop is wetter and not able to be picked up do to the consistency. I initially thought he might have grown some type of intolerance to his food but than I remembered that originally when this started we took him off his food and that didn’t help in anyway. Now I’ve come to the conclusion that what must of been helping was the probiotic paste and that maybe he needs something  like Purina Pro Plan FortiFlora to help maintain a healthy digestive system and keep his stool consistent.

547,dogs,"Hello. My grandma got me a puppy and for the first 6 months I havent been able to spend as much time as I needed to with him, because of late college nights. This resulted in my grandparents stepping in when I couldnt adequately give him affection.

My grandparents have fought my wishes at every turn. I wanted to crate train him as a means of potty training him and helping him with his seperation anxiety. Hed cry late into the night and sometimes I couldn't handel that (I usually have him every night) theyd take him and let him sleep in bed. Which ruined and negated all effects on crate training and ive given up, evem though hes peed in my bed 3 times because of it.

Now they take him out every day with them to eat, while leaving him in the car (unless its hot) which I was against. I didnt want him left in the car regardless cause I wouldnt leave a baby in the car. Now he whines at my door for hours to go back to them, unless hes tired or im constantly playing tugowar (which i dont mind but i cant do it all day). And when I try to get him to stay in my room to reinforce our bonding, he whines and my grandma says its not fair to leave him down there, cause they want him.

I tried telling them we need another dog, because they want one so bad since theirs passed. But they wont. I dont leave the house unless its for school so I cant take him (literally going broke from gas so yea im boring) and ive caught my grandpa giving him human food multiple times when I was COMPLETELY against that because their last dog became obese cause of it, like its actually stupid to give this breed human food, theyre super suseptable to obesity and it also makes my dog love my grandpa more cause he gets treats whenever he begs for it. 

Theyre reinforcing several bad behaviors and its really peeving me off and I want my dog to wanna be with me. Is it too late to change this dynamic? If not how do I fix it? Im tired of letting him spend all his time with them when they wont even follow the rules I wanted.",t2_ern4q63,0,Dog Wants My Grandparents More,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zqmlp1,True,Picachu50000,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zqmlp1/dog_wants_my_grandparents_more/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zqmlp1/dog_wants_my_grandparents_more/,2473252,1671537680,0,,False,1671537698,1671537698,2022-12-20 12:01:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this dog is EXTREMELY particular, bougie, and dramatic so i’ll just say a couple of things about him so that you have an idea of what he is like:

his name is marre ( MAR - E ) 

he likes to have every blanket engulf him so if you just have a blanket laying out he will pull the planet with his paws (like digging a hole). 

he doesn’t like the rain, the snow, long walks, other dogs with their owners but will be nice to them and sniff them once he finally get up to the person. also loveeeees people. He is a nervous wreck and is afraid of everything, and is sort of a pushover :/. he is incredibly sweet and is a great cuddler!! he does things w me that he never does w anyone else like sleep w me in my room (he never sleeps with ANYONE on that floor) and fall asleep in my arms (he never gets settled). we go on walks and i seriously love this dog with all my heart. i’m a junior in college and am mainly choosing to stay in this town because of that dog. 

i heard from her owners that she has been depressed because i’m not around (it’s been three days since i saw her), she wouldn’t go to sleep and she was looking for me. i would truly die for this dog, i have never felt more understood than besides when i’m with this dog. i feel bad for all the nights when i sometimes didn’t want snuggles and pushed him away. marre is just so sweet. (he is a Pomeranian).


when i heard about how he was doing it made me so sad, back when i was first babysitting him and i left i couldn’t really sleep the first couple of nights and ended up holding a pillow to sleep. my question is how do i cope with not seeing this dog 24 hrs? i was with this family for nearly a month",t2_pcgw776w,0,i built an incredible bond w my dog,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zqig5d,True,loudmelon21,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zqig5d/i_built_an_incredible_bond_w_my_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zqig5d/i_built_an_incredible_bond_w_my_dog/,2473206,1671523075,0,,False,1671523088,1671523089,2022-12-20 07:57:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,dogs,"My 12 year old German Shepard/Great Dane mix was diagnosed with lymphoma 3 months ago and we began treating him with chemotherapy to help slow the progression. We were told a couple of weeks ago that his lymph nodes were back to normal size and that he appeared to be in remission. Last week, he started showing signs of a lack of appetite and rapid breathing so when we brought him in for his chemo on Friday we mentioned it to the doctor, thinking maybe he was experiencing side effects from the chemo. The vet ran an ultrasound and X-rays just to make sure nothing else was going on. Then we got the worst phone call of our lives. The vet told us that it he appeared to have multiple tumors in his lungs as well as his spleen. He also has a pleural effusion in his chest cavity because of the tumors. The vet told us that he could euthanize him that day but we could not bring ourselves to put him to sleep mere hours after dropping him off for a routine chemo treatment. The vet did a chest tap and drained 2 liters of fluid that didn’t appear to have much blood in it(I forgot the terminology for it). We made an appointment for today (Tuesday) at 1pm and now that it is hours away, I’m not sure what to do. It’s been made even worse because his appetite has come back over the last couple days and he has also been drinking regularly. He is still completely alert and conscious, and he still wags his tail and is happy when we pet him. The only issue is his breathing and coordination. He has intense abdominal breathing after climbing the stairs and also has slight abdominal/rapid breathing when laying down. Obviously, being able to breathe normally is very important but we’re worried about putting him to sleep prematurely. On the other hand there are no overnight animal hospitals in this part of the state so I worry about waiting too long also. I just don’t know how we can put him to sleep when he’s still eating/drinking and happy to be around us. We feel so conflicted.

562,dogs,"TL:DR; Old dog needs back leg exercise ideas to help stop muscle atrophy but going for long walks and swimming aren't available options in an extremely cold small town.

  
My pup is a 13 year old german shepherd, she's had hip issues for years. She uses her back legs independently when walking but if she starts moving faster or goes up stairs she uses them like a tripod, very close together in the middle, sometimes they are close enough to tangle each other. 2 or 3 years ago she stopped being able to get into a vehicle on her own, now she struggles to get up the 4 stairs into our home and loses her back footing regularly. She manages to get on the couch about 4 out of 5 times, the other time she ends up back on the ground. Her front end is still very strong and for a GSD of her age she's got plenty of energy. I need ideas for helping her work her back legs.  


The challenge in this question is that we live in a small cabin in a small town in a remote northern area. It's been -30f for the past 3 days and will probably be below 0 for a few more months so going on long walks outside is not an option. There aren't any places I'm aware of that are large enough and dog friendly to walk her inside within a 2 hour radius. We have no room for a tread mill and there are no pools. I don't want to discuss supplements as I'm not sure if that might violate group rules about medical advice but she's been taking a variety of things for a while, hip health in mind.

566,dogs,"Hi dog Reddit. First post and I’m making it in good faith and with a sad heart because I feel I know the outcome already.

We have two dogs, one is about 4 1/2 that we’ve had since she was a puppy. She’s a St Bernard/Great Dane mix and is 117 lbs now. We have been admittedly bad dog owners with her and training has never been good. She’s basically been off leash for her entire life and runs around with our other adult Great Dane (9ish yo male) on our property which is enclosed by an invisible fence. 

There have been multiple instances of aggression towards humans on our property, including uncontrollable barking at passersby and then escalating to several moderate to bad bites of dog sitters and maintenance workers. A couple years ago we took her to a behaviorist but didn’t see results from our (again, admittedly bad) training intervention.  She determined that our dog was exhibiting fear-based behavior, which was manifesting in the barking and aggression. 

All previous instances have happened on our property until this weekend when she jumped out of our car and bit someone. I’m not sure what provoked it as I was loading the car while she was in it and lost track of her. It’s my fault as owner and I feel horrible for the person she bit as well as for her. 

We thought we could manage situations for her. That appears to be more than we can handle with the constant bustle of kids and activities and jobs and everything else and now the incidents appear to be getting worse. I’m pretty torn up about it, but even typing it here I know what we need to do. Our kids will be heartbroken and I will miss her too because she is great with us. Silly and fun and loving. She cuddles and kisses and plays sweet with all of us and even some strangers that she gets comfortable with. It’s hard for me to believe the same dog is responsible for such dangerous behavior. 

We have an appointment with the vet in the morning to discuss what comes next. We obviously can’t give her away without disclosing and no one will take her on to train. I’m feeling bad for myself and my family and for our dog, who we’ve done a severe disservice to by not dedicating what we needed to train her properly.

For me: Even though I don’t like barking, I got a famously barky breed — the rough collie. I’m super glad I didn’t talk myself out of it, because the breed is sooo perfect for me in literally every other way, and the collie biddability made it possible to train her to be very quiet for the most part (she gets a pass when she’s playing with other dogs haha). She’s now the quietest dog I’ve ever owned, which tbh has done wonders for my self-confidence re: dog training.

I also wanted to get an adult collie, but mine was 5 months when I got her; even though I didn’t, uh, enjoy a lot of the young dog phase, I’m really happy she’s my dog.

576,dogs,"Hey all! I adopted a lovely dog in 2019. He's been nothing but the sweetest baby! 

My dog has always been an anxious one. He came with separation anxiety, which he's now much better. Still anxious but he calms himself down soon after vs. He used to soil the house as soon as we left. 

During COVID, dog parks were closed so we would take him out for long walks. However, I'm not sure what has gone wrong but he's more and more scared of going outside. As soon as he steps inside the elevator for our walks, he would start trembling. He always wants to go home right after he's done with his business. He doesn't like going for walks anymore and no matter how much I drag him, he just wants to go home.

He's become much more sensitive to loud noises like construction, buses, cars, etc. There were a couple times he got traumatized by fireworks sound and I think this was the cause of his anxiety. On major holidays, we now try to bring him out way earlier before fireworks.

I've tried desensitizing him to sounds. I would play fire alarm sound, fire trucks, siren, etc. randomly at home and give him treats and praise. He still hasn't overcome fireworks sound though but we're working on it.

He's not food motivated when he's out.

R was the first “big sister” that K saw - we fostered K and her litter sisters, and after seeing how K interacted w/ R and what she needed in terms of running space, we kept her. They thrived. K wasn’t co-dependent physically, but she followed R’s reactions (or lack thereof, if that makes sense). 

I’m scheduling a call with K’s vet this week - she knows K, she knew R, and is familiar with both pet-specifics and family dynamics. 

I’m curious to know about others that have brought in another dog or cat in a similar situation. We’ve always adopted and expect to continue that way, so I’m down with suggestions for fostering (as  long as we meet the foster organization‘s specifications).

He sleeps in my bed at night. I work from home so am with him almost all of the time.  I initially got a crate, and tried to leave him in there when I left, but he hated it! I've tried putting treats in there and he is fine going in there to get them. I've sat next to him while he's locked in the crate and he seems okay. It's just when I shut the door to that room that the crate is in that he freaks out! Even with a kong with peanut butter (his FAVORITE!). When I get back home, I can hear barking even before reaching the front door. He usually has ripped up anything within reach (numerous blankets and toys), and he is panting heavily.

602,dogs,"Hello everyone. I’m currently researching looking for a large breed dog to accompany me on my travels. I’m a young woman who frequently travels by car with my two current dogs, a crotchety old mini schnauzer that rides in my purse and my Newfoundland/Poodle mix who’s about 3 now. We’ve had a few run ins with creeps and my Newf mix is just too friendly towards strangers. I’m currently too young to concealed carry in my state and am looking for a dog to help deter people.I’ve been looking at the Chesapeake Bay Retriever because they’re brown, very smart, and have a protective streak. I do work a full time job, so a dog with super high drive wouldn’t be ideal. Obedience training is not a problem for me, as I prefer my dogs to have competition-level obedience. I was thinking maybe a Red Doberman but their exercise needs might be an issue as well. I also live on about 3/4 of an acre but do not have a fence though I am outside watching my dogs at all times to keep them close. My dogs are crated when I am gone with kongs to keep them busy, and I come home on my lunch break to let them outside. I’m just unsure and would like some feedback- maybe from some chessie owners or owners of other protection breeds on what would be a good dog to fit the niche that I need.

Until today. Today she had such a fit. By the time it was finished, she had no memory of either me or my husband. She remembered me first, then him, but any commands are still not remembered.

Last Week at night I started hearing intense gurgling noises coming from my dogs belly. To be honest I'm not sure if I noticed this 3 years ago when I got her but for some reason I've been real vigilant when it comes to her health. Sorta like health anxiety.
Anyways she got spayed/nurtured two months ago. After she got fixed I noticed she started looking skinny. I've taken her to the vet before and they did a stool sample and heart worm test and examined her and everything came out fine. These Gurgling sounds I heard were loud. then my dog started pacing. I remember I was awake all night because I was afraid something might be wrong. I took her out at 2am and 3am because since she was pacing i thought maybe she had to use the bathroom but sometimes she paces for no reason. 



Shes been pacing sometimes at night since I got her but the pacing she’s done before it was actually due to her having to use the bathroom and she pooped in the house. The following morning I thought she was hungry so I feed her chicken and rice. After I feed her the noises went away. My dog can't be hungry because she eats a lot. I called the vet and they told me that if she's vomiting or have diarrhea and doesn't eat then to bring her in. She's not vomiting or has diarrhea. She's eating normally. Actually she's been eating a lot. 


Sometimes when I'm away from home my brother tells me my mom feeds the dog the food she eats and I keep telling her to stop giving the dog human food. Sometimes it's a battle because my mom doesn't listen and she doesn't understand that the vet cost money. She doesn't feel the affects of it because it's not her dog. It's my dog.

The thing is I feel guilty all the time. It’s constant. I’m always feeling bad that I don’t do enough for him. We go on at least 3 walks a day, we play with his ball at the park for 20-30 mins. I take him to dog parks a couple times a week. He plays with water several times a day because he loves the sprinkler. He gets treats, he’s allowed on the couch and I have lick mats, puzzle toys, and a bin full of stuffed toys. 

I know that he gets enough attention, but I can no longer sit for more than two hours without feeling like I need to entertain him. I’m constantly overwhelmed and sometimes the guilt is even more difficult to bear because I just don’t want to get up and walk him or train him or anything. Sometimes I just want to be home on the couch and be lazy. But then the guilt sets in and I’m off taking him out or doing something with him.

I’ve tried to talk to my therapist but she keeps reminding me “he’s just a dog” and to some extent I know I’m being crazy and she’s right, but the guilt and overwhelm doesn’t stop.

617,dogs,"I just wanted to share my experience this week with Canine Vestibular Disease. It involves my 14 year old Golden Retriever. She has always been healthy aside from arthritis in her hind legs. The following describes the events as they happened to us.

&amp;nbsp;

On Tuesday all was normal, she ate, drank, walked, and played until around 4PM. I noticed she was lying in bed glancing left to right as if she saw something or was looking for something. At first I laughed. ""What are you looking for?"" I asked. I searched her bed with her for a minute. Maybe she dropped a piece of food there, but there was nothing. Her glances continued. Up, down, left, right. Upon further inspection I notice excessive eye movements as well. They are darting around in the socket as if she just got off a rollercoaster. This is the point where the panic sets in. I don't want anything to happen to my companion, but my bank account was already sucked dry. Rent was just paid today. Can I afford to call the vet right now? Fuck it, if it comes to it I'll overdraft it. This is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I call the vet then very rapidly, and incoherently explain the above events. I quickly received an over the phone diagnosis of Canine idiopathic vestibular disease, also known as ""Old dog vestibular syndrome"". A condition mostly occurring in older dogs during which their sense of balance leaves them. They cannot right themselves as they are unable to tell up from down. I am told by the vet at this point to simply support and monitor.


&amp;nbsp;

After the call I googled the condition to learn more. Everything I read online matched with what I saw and what the vet told me. I decided to take the vet's advice and simply monitor and support my dog. As the night grew darker so did her symptoms. She began to attempt to stand, already arthritic this was a problem. She would stumble and fall. As I did not want her to injure herself I had to lay down with her for several hours to provide comfort and prevent her from trying to get up. On the phone the vet mentioned dosing her with an anti-vertigo medication called Meclizine. I did get her to take one, however she began vomiting. In total that night she did so again three times. At this point she was refusing any food, or water. She had soiled herself in the process. Seeing my dog in this state was one of the most painful things I have experienced. Eventually around 3AM, she fell asleep. So did I.

&amp;nbsp;

The following morning she was not much better. Although she would now accept water. I decided to take her to the vet that day to ease my concerns. I had to carry her (70lbs+) into the car, and into the vet's office. Upon examination the vet said her vitals are normal and the only thing aside from waiting was to give her an anti-nausea injection called ""Cerenia"". She received the injection then I brought her back home. Slowly her symptoms have been disappearing. 

&amp;nbsp;

* Day 2 - Stopped vomiting, accepted water.
* Day 3 -  Head movement stopped, accepted food
* Day 4 - Eye movement stopped, Appetite resumed normally. 
* Day 5 - Sitting up again on her own. Attempting to stand again, fruitlessly.
* Day 6 ( Today ) - Can kind of walk, only with my assistance. Stumbles badly


&amp;nbsp;

Going forward, I'm extremely concerned as to if she will ever be able to walk again. I have to carry her outside to relive herself still. Every movement she makes has me turning my head in a panic.

 IE a mini poodle mix with weather plunging to -13F/-25C, so yes actual arctic weather with the windchill pushing it past -27F/-33C.

With the jacket, it seems to be able to deal with the cold for 10 mins at a time. I didn’t want to push it cause I’m not sure if it truly knows how bad it can be, so we did a quick lap. I know 100% without the winter gear, it goes outside to pee and wants to come back in IMMEDIATELY.

Now, some more background: my mom had come in for the holiday and is staying with me, and she can stay with him for a bit, but not the whole day. 

I know that I'll feel guilty for leaving him and seeing the show, but I also know that I will regret not seeing the show(I'm seeing Beetlejuice before it closes).

I take him on a walk everyday, and praise him when he goes outside, but he doesn't take treats and he's too focused or scared on what's going on around him in the world to care about toys. he'll chase a ball if i throw it, but won't pick it up and just carry on walking, making me pick it up.

Hi,

My 8 year old yorkie has something like a wound under the front left leg with occasional discharge of transparent liquid. 

When I first noticed it I took her to the veterinarian and he told me that it is noting to worry about. 

10 days later the wound/scab is still the same, went to the vet again today and he suggested needle core biopsy. 

She behaves absolutely fine and I really don’t want to put her through too much stress. 

Do you thing that it is just some harmless skin condition or maybe cancer?

I just finished chemo myself so I know that nobody can say without biopsy, but I really don’t want to put her and me through unnecessary stress if it seems like something harmless/benign.

He's an 8lb mutt with a Napoleon complex who's been bossing around my 75lb dog since she was a puppy and I've never seen him like this. Just pacing and shaking. I'm trying to stick to his routine of crate time, walks and feeding as my parents do them as best I can but I have a job and my schedule can't revolve around the dog.

I also have to walk him and my own dog separately because he's will bark at other dogs and my dog who normally never does will copy him and it scares people when she does, I also don't want her to learn the behavior from him. 


Anytime we're not doing something routine he's pacing and shaking by my kitchen door. I don't think he's slept in three days, at least not that I've seen. He gets the same way during thunderstorms but it's been constant. And he hasn't eaten anything except for chicken breast since they dropped him off. I've moved around his crate a few times to see if he's happier in quite or busier parts of our house but he just yowls in it which he's never done at my parents house AFAIK. 


Boyfriend says I am insane, leave him alone and he'll be fine. But this dog is crazy important to my parents (I joke they love him more then they love me) and I'm getting worried because I can see he's visibly skinnier (and this is a very skinny dog to begin with). 


I guess I'm just looking for any advice on what I can do to make him more comfortable or if yall think I'm being nuts and should just leave him alone.

637,dogs,"My dog poops A LOT. Typically on a 2 mile walk she will poop 3-5 times and they get progressively runnier. First two are solid (and large) but the third is much runnier and anything after that is nearly impossibly to get up with a bag since it's so loose. She gets really excited to go out and walk so we started waiting till she was calm and being really intentional about her leash manners. It's helped in the sense that she has a great heel but it's like she's so happy to be out there she just can't stop pooping. Sometimes I won't even realize that she's just pooping while we walk and I have to go back and clean up poop trails off the sidewalk or road. 

We've been to the vet so many times and they've looked into a suspected food allergy and inflammatory bowel disease and after elimination diets, steroids, and a lot of trial and error, we got her on a grain-free salmon/sweet potato food. It seemed to help her since she stopped throwing up bile so often (still does it about once a month) and having diarrhea accidents but today she had an accident in the house for the first time in a while and I feel so defeated. We don't give her any treats or table food, just her food and the occasional small piece of dried liver. 

She's going to the vet *again* tomorrow but it's been so expensive and tiring (and gross) just trying to figure out what's going on with her.

638,dogs,"When we were making big (life threatening) decisions about my dog's health, I relied SO heavily on others experience, so I hope this helps any of you panic searching at 3am for help or answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*I am not a VET, this is my personal experience owning a very medically complicated dog\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Dog: Echo

Age when adopted: 8 weeks, rescued through non-profit after being found among 34 other puppies on a puppy farm in Nashville. Clearly the farm was used to breed tiny toy dogs. They found chihuahuas, Pomeranians, corgi's and other ""designer"" breeds in horrible conditions. 

&amp;#x200B;

13 weeks old: Noticed she wasn't healing after her initial puppy shots. Her skin was scabbing and then sort of oozing. Doctor assumed allergy to medication, eventually fixed. 

15 weeks old: Echo is finally 3 pounds and able to be spayed - yay! Or so we thought. Echo goes to initial spay appt, they do prelim bloodwork due to her size and she has elevated ALT levels and they will not do the spay. We are anxious (Vet tells us this could be liver disease) but grateful that she is ok. 

We get more panels done, Echo's blood work is strange. Slightly elevated ALT but generally fine. We do a Bile Acid Test (Fine) as well as an Ultrasound of her liver. They are searching for a liver shunt which would explain her small size and her ALT levels. Ultrasound is clear. Vet believes it is ok to do spay. We reschedule spay. 

20 Weeks Old: Echo goes into heat exactly one day before her spay. We're frustrated with the timing of course, but it is what it is. We reschedule spay for 6 weeks after the end of her heat cycle \*We will go on to call this our ""miracle moment""\*

22 Weeks Old: Echo's heat is over, but we are noticing that she is REALLY really aggressive. She bites both of us pretty badly for the first time with no warning, but we attribute it to just her little body dealing with hormones. 

24 Weeks Old: We get back the results of the Embark Testing we had done. We thought it would be fun to see how many weird breeds she is. She is a unique and sort of hilarious looking dog. We find out she is 58% inbred and a mix of chihuahua/corgi/pomeranian/american eskimo dog (weird). 

\*\*\*The next day we get an email from Embark's Customer Service with an Embark Vet CC'd. They were writing to tell us they had found a very strange mutation in Echo's saliva and that it was likely an error. They went on to write that it is VERY uncommon in chihuahua's. They said she had Von Willebrand Disease but that it was Type 3. Meaning that Echo had less than 1% blood clot factors in her body.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

We send it to our primary vet, she agreed that it was really unlikely but we did a $2500 test in which they had to prick echo and see how she clotted. She didn't clot. Echo bled little droplets for over 2 hours from a tiny prick in her skin. The test results came back and confirmed that she had &gt;1% blood clotting factors. Our vet had a long and very intense conversation about the new ways we needed to operate around Echo and caring for her to avoid any sort of injury. A thorny stick on a walk could be fatal due to her size. It was awful. The ONLY silver lining we could find was that if we had spayed her either of the times we had tried - she would have instantly died on the table. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next year is a blur. We see specialists and have surgery consults eager to see if we are still able to spay Echo. A Pyometra would be completely deadly, not to mention any complications with her heat cycle. 3 Major surgeons say no. We are in NYC so we have access to brilliant surgeons. We make the decision when she is 1 that she won't be spayed. We'll love her for as long as we have her and make her as comfortable as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Echo is 1.5 years old she has a seizure. She is running around and then just flops over and is unable to get back up. Once I stand her back up (thinking maybe she is playing) she can not engage movement backward or forward and eventually poops and pees while this is happening.  It is terrifying. We are confident that she is dying. It goes on for almost 2 minutes. We sprint to the ER with her and they hook her up to IV's (VERY CAREFULLY) and tell us there isn't much they can do and we should see a specialist. 

&amp;#x200B;

We schedule an appt with a neurologist who diagnoses Echo with Hydrocephalus which means there is swelling in and around her brain. She will have seizures for the rest of her life but they are not painful to her. We put her on Omeprazole and literally can't believe that this poor little dog is so medically complicated. We're heartbroken again. 

Her bloodwork comes back. She has extremely elevated ALT levels - they think she may have Micro Vascular Dysplasia. The only thing to confirm is a liver biopsy. Surgery - a no go for the pup. 

With the new diagnosis of Liver disease and hydrocephalus - the speciality surgery team at Animal Medical reached out to ask if we would entertain the idea of a laparoscopic spay with full blood transfusion. They could spay echo and increase her quality of life with relative confidence that she would make it through the surgery. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was the decision I dreaded making. If you are reading this after having to make this decision or after your dog passed due to this decision. I am so sorry. I wouldn't wish having to make this decision on my WORST enemy. A helpless, young dog and an ""elective"" surgery that would improve her quality of life or kill her. 

&amp;#x200B;

We did it. And she lived. it was $11,000 and I fought to the end for it to be covered by pet insurance. She was in the hospital for 3 days. Received a full blood transfusion and cryoprecipitate. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's doing fine now. She's had another seizure, her liver is still elevated and we treat her like a bubble dog. But she's ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you're here for VWD, ALT/Microvascular dysplasia or hydrocephalus I wish I could make this easier for you. It feels like SO much responsibility beyond already owning and caring for a dog. I'd love to help in any way I can. To be completely transparent, Echo's care has cost us over 20k up front, 17k of which was reimbursed through pet insurance. We got pet insurance when Echo was 9 weeks old, before she was diagnosed with anything.

However we always have ignored her when she gets like this, and lately the demand barking has only gotten worse. And it’s always right after we’ve spent time playing with her or when we’re about to do chores.

This puppy gets a lot of attention and stimulation daily and 2 hrs exercise since she’s super high energy. Also we’re just started doing daily treat command training again just to refresh her memory and keep her motivation to listen.

 She’s not a food motivated dog so bones or Kongs she will give up on, but toys she’ll chew to their death so she always has those, but she still gets bored of them.

My brother (5M) is a pretty hyperactive and get mad at the smallest thing type of kid and has even showed signs of aggression, of course we have been trying to tone down this behaviour with regular visits to doctors, and the thing that troubles me the most is if we should adopt a dog or wait for his behavior to become more controllable or not as aggressive, I don't wanna sound negative but I'm only curious as to whether he could maybe be a potential danger to the dog in question or if a dog's affection would help keep him calm.

654,dogs,"Hi all. The dog in question is a collie and he’s 3 or 4 years old. He was adopted from the breeder in a re-homing situation about 5 months ago. The breeder said that he was house trained, but he has made several messes (both bowel and bladder) in multiple homes (primary home and grandma’s house). As far as we can tell, his only real communication that he needs to go, is that he will start pacing around the house kind of suddenly. Other than that, he doesn’t seem to make a peep (which is interesting considering he’s very vocal in general), and doesn’t go to the door or come up to us or anything. Or if he does, it’s not in an obvious “I need to go outside” kind of way and may be mistaken for his regular “can I have some attention” greeting. 

We have tried working with him on potty training techniques, but he’s pretty stubborn in general and doesn’t necessarily seem to be eager to please us and learn. we know that he knows several simple commands, and he’s an intelligent breed, and yet he doesn’t listen/follow those commands consistently. So I’m not sure if he just doesn’t care and just wants to go whenever and wherever and isn’t afraid of any repercussions. 

I didn’t grow up with dogs so I don’t really know what’s normal or not, so I’m wondering how common of a situation this is. Do we just need to keep working with him? Does he have a good potential to change his behavior if 5 months isn’t enough time?

655,dogs,"Disclaimer: I'm NOT looking for medical advice or a proper diagnosis. I also DON'T need to be told to take my dog to the vet, I will be taking my dog to the vet ASAP, but it's right before Xmas, there's only one veterinary clinic in this stupid town and they are busy, so I doubt we'll get in until next week and I am an anxious mess when it comes to the health and wellbeing of my dog, so I am only making this thread to try put myself at ease so I won't spend the next week constantly worrying and stressing about it while nightmare scenarios play off in my head on repeat. My dog is eating well, enjoying her snacks, drinking like usual, she's playful, runs around in the snow and not acting any differently.

Onward to business. 

Slight background, unsure of relevance: My dog - a 5 year old bulldog, has an umbilical hernia that she's had since she was a puppy. Two years ago she got spayed after a possible pyometra situation, they didn't fix the hernia even though they started the incision to remove the uterus right by the skin-pouch (where the intestines that poke out of the hole in her abdomen make a small bulge) or whatever I should call it. The skin-pouch is not super big, and the intestines can be pushed back, but they are usually ""popped out"" and filling up the skin-pouch when she's standing and moving around.

This afternoon, I was rubbing her belly and felt this weird....thing, which is what my title is referring to. I'll try my best to describe it, idk if I can share videos here. This has appeared over the last week or so, so it's rather sudden, and I think it might be a foreign object. 

The location is inside the skin-pouch. It's not big, no more than 1,5 cm in length. It feels pretty solid (I didn't squeeze too hard though, since I don't know what I'm dealing with), and it's movable, I can move it easily up and down the length of the skin-pouch (4ish cm) by pushing it with my finger, but it doesn't seem to want to move out of that particular area. It appears to be shaped like a capsule, it's rounded on both ends, but it feels like it's bigger in the middle. I can sort of see it slightly through the skin when I move it, and it looks like one end is dark colored, the middle is light colored and the other end appears to also be dark colored. 

I feel worried simply because of the location, it's right by an opening into her abdominal cavity so who knows if it could get ""sucked in"" there when her intestines move, and since her intestines are right there, I worry about them being damaged by whatever this is. Could it possibly be her microchip if that has migrated and somehow ended up there? I know it's rare for it to move, but it does happen.

658,dogs,"I’m writing for some advice on how to handle a situation between my 10F dog (G) and a 13M (R) dog who I’m fostering, possibly adopting.
 
Some background: I got G as a puppy. She was well socialized and loved to play with other dogs. However, she had a lot of separation anxiety, so when she turned 1, we added a 5M rescue (B) to our house and that helped tremendously with the anxiety. It took G and B about a week to figure out who was more dominant, and G easily won. B was a very chill dog and didn’t like conflict, so he always let her go out the door first, would move if he was in “her” spot on the couch, and never minded if she took food that was meant for him. They were very close, and sadly, he passed away a little over a year ago. G became anxious again when left alone, but she also had time to get used to being an only dog.
 
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when we got R, who is very sweet and not aggressive, but there have been some conflicts. By this I mean teeth baring, growling, snarling, and barking from both of them – but no biting each other. I know these thing can escalate quickly so I’m trying to get ahead of it.
 
Some examples:
- A piece of food falls on the floor and they fight over it.
- R is in G’s spot on the couch and she gets mad at barks at him, and he barks back, and then we see lots of teeth and snarling.
- R is getting some attention and G pushes him aside so she can get attention too, and R gets mad that he was bumped so they start snarling and snapping at each other (no contact, but they appear to be close).
- R is sniffing G; sometimes she ignores it, other times I see her baring her teeth at him and his vision/hearing are not great so he doesn’t see the sign and she will end up snapping at him. If I can see that she’s being tolerant, I praise her. If I see her baring her teeth I will redirect him.
 
Here’s what I’ve been doing:
- Feeding them in separate rooms.
- Not leaving them alone together when nobody is home. They are in separate rooms when home alone.
- Keeping an eye on the situation when I can to monitor if I see a possible problem and try to redirect them. I will also praise them if they are being good to one another.  
- Trying to walk them together every day when the weather allows to help them bond outside of the home. They walk together very nicely.
 
I realize that G is a diva and is used to getting her own way. She mostly ignores R, and he ignores her too but does seem interested in sitting next to her sometimes. For the most part they are fine when they are on the couch next to each other -- as long as it’s not too close and one doesn’t bump the other one. They also sleep together on the couch downstairs, but it’s just them so there’s plenty of room and there have been no conflicts at night.
 
These conflicts have been happening about once a day and they always stop immediately when I yell “stop” or make a loud noise, or if I need to, pull one away from the other one by the collar. Yesterday we got through the whole day with no incidents. I realize as I’m writing this that there may not be cause for much concern and that this may just take more time to sort itself out, but again, I know things can escalate and I want some feedback on how to keep the peace between these two. I’m happy to answer questions if something is not clear, and any advice would be appreciated.

666,dogs," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a family dog who was a rescue (she died this year), and I currently have a chocolate lab who will be 5 in February 2023.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I think I’d go with a reputable breeder because you can tell so much more about what the dog’s appearance might look life, history, ensure that the dog is in good health, etcetera. I’d also have a better chance at socializing the dog.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Even tempered, cuddly, biddable, doesn’t have the typical dog odor, intelligent, loyal, not overly standoffish towards strangers.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* German Sheperds, Klee Kai, Keeshonds, Norwegian Elkhound, Border Collies, and many others.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* potentially respond to seizures, get help/alert someone in the event that I have a seizure, basic obedience and the standard commands.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Possibly service dog/assistance dog work.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* maybe 30 minutes

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* An upwards of an hour or so on a typical day.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’m fine with brushing and potentially trimming. I also don’t see myself having a problem with occasionally pay a groomer, albeit certainly not regularly.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Probably about medium sized/ not too big.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I’d rather avoid slobber if possible as it really grosses me out, shedding is fine, preferably not too much barking (my lab already barks at random people biking or walking their dogs by our house).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Pretty important, although not absolutely necessary.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Ideally a snuggly dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* For the most part eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Alert to a knock on the door or entering the yard. Greet strangers in a friendly but not overly enthusiastic manner.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d much rather avoid any agression, resource guarding, etcetera, but I’m sure I could find a way to combat it.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Resource guarding, overt aggression towards people, overly protective.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Hopefully for minimal periods of time and ideally for no more than 3 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I’m not sure.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* A have an American Shorthair cat who is almost 11, a Chocolate Lab who is nearing 5 years, my family has a chicken, parakeets, a pet hamster, and a corn snake.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I can’t be sure but potentially older children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I do not rent currently but there is a chance that I will in the future.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* The US and I am not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Maybe 70°F in the summer and maybe 30ish in the winter (but at times below 0°F).

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

671,dogs,"Im sorry this is super long and a lot of information so bare with me. I’m at a breaking point. I’ve had my rescue dog for a year now, and over the course of that year have tried 10 different foods with him. Nothing seems to work- he eats really well for almost a week and then randomly will refuse a meal. He then goes and eats grass, throws up, and he’s ready for the next meal. Every now and then he’ll skip two meals so he’ll go a day without eating. No matter what I try, he always ends up with an upset stomach. but the thing that confuses me is it’s not consistent and not right after he eats, so it seems like it’s not a food related thing? maybe just gastro issues?

I have gone to the vet for it twice, and all they did was give prescription food and antibiotics. obviously i need more of a long term solution… so i’m switching vets but in the meantime i have no clue what to do. he currently has not eaten in 3 days, which he’s never done before. I did switch his food (very gradually) about two weeks ago. he loved it, ate every meal for a solid 5-6 days and then suddenly stopped eating and it’s now the third day of this. I don’t know how to get him to eat, and he keeps throwing up because there’s nothing in his stomach. should i buy a small bag of the food he was on before this one? wait it out and see if he’ll eat? i don’t want him to starve. but i’m home for the holidays right now so I can’t go to his regular vet. until after the new year. he seems perfectly healthy otherwise, he’s a happy dog, drinks water, poops are pretty normal- he just refuses to eat.

672,dogs,"My childhood dog unfortunately had to be put down in August right before I left for college. While I was at school, my parents adopted a 12 year old Chipin (chihuahua and miniature pinscher mix). He was brought to the home before I moved back, so I assume it's due to me being a ""new person"" in the house to him. Everytime I walk inside, he starts barking and growling at me, but lets me pet him, pick him up, give him attention, etc. I can sit or stand still and he calms down, but once I make any type of move he starts barking and growling again, even chasing and nudging me whenever I walk away with my back turned towards him. He's only like this when my mother is around. When she isn't around, he's quiet and looks nervous. He has never bit, bared his teeth, or done anything to cause physical harm or show extreme aggression. 

I've only been home for about 4 days now so I expect it to take some time for him to warm up to me, but I was wondering if there was anything I could do to try to show him I'm not a scary, intimidating human. So far, I've been crouching/sitting down on the ground, letting him sniff me and letting him come up to me on his own regard. I've offered him treats, starting with one on the ground close to me and working up to him taking one directly from my hand. When I'm sitting, he'll paw at me for pets when I do this and nudge me for more when I stop. He's even walked into my lap and curled up on it.

674,dogs,"Just sometime ago I've picked myself up a german shepherd siberian husky mix pup, he's around 10 weeks old now extremely smart learns in the matter of minutes and he's an absolute angel but many times a day he completely switches, for example I take him down to potty and out of nowhere he starts aggressively biting my legs me the leash and everything and goes completely bonkers until he starts choking because i hold him off of me, same when we are playing inside but he adds in a revenge pee on one of our carpets when I try to stop him. The way I react is with a firm no, not screaming but a different tone. I don't pull my hands away so he doesn't think of me as a toy instead i let him bite so he doesn't get excited and wait for him to calm down or I try redirecting with a toy but it doesn't feel like play biting at all, he play bites too and that's very different, I'm genuinely scared of him sometimes. So the next step is trying to ignore him by getting on my bed with my arms crossed facing away but he doesn't react to that and either pees on a carpet or starts biting something he knows he can't bite to get me to stop him and then he starts biting again until he tires himself out. He sometimes also does this when he wants to go potty or eat early, we feed him adequately even a little extra but it's mostly out of the blue when he just gets this brain switch and there's little we can do and as he's growing bigger the bed trick no longer works as he can just easily jump up and his bites start to hurt a lot more as he grows so we get more and more frustrated. I've tried loud yelps but that just makes him go even more crazy, tried redirecting with commands such as sit lay down or paw but when he's in his bonkers mode he won't listen to a single thing, recently started closing the door on him as a time-out for around a minute which seems to rarely work. I believe he will grow out of it but at the same time this is not a behavior we can tolerate. He has a mountain of toys to play with, nothing he could be scared of in our home, he's very comfortable and trusts us a lot yet he goes completely crazy sometimes.

687,dogs,"Hi All, 
Just trying to get some advice on a situation. I have a 5 year old labradoodle and 3 kids, the youngest being 2 years old. We’ve been wanting to get a buddy for our current dog for a while but it wasn’t the right time during pregnancy/new baby. I finally feel like my son is independent enough and I have the bandwidth to take on another dog, so I’ve been looking for a new dog the last couple months. I found one from a rescue a couple hours away from me who seemed perfect! The rescue told me he was house broken, and had the most amazing temperament ever. Perfect for a home with a toddler. So without ever meeting the dog I agreed to adopt. They charged me an adoption fee of $650, plus an additional $300 to get the dog delivered to my home. Within hours of arrive this new dog bit my son, it wasn’t a provoked bite either it was pretty random. The new dog was incredibly nervous as expected and I had been trying to keep my son away while he settled in, but my son was so excited about the dog and didn’t understand that he can’t just go up to this other dog like our dog. Anyway it was very upsetting and I contacted the rescue immediately and just said I don’t think a toddler home is the right fit as every time he was around my son the dog seemed incredibly nervous and uneasy plus the bite kinda cemented that we aren’t a good fit. The dog also was marking inside the house and stalking my cats like prey, even though I was assured he was good with cats too. Those other behaviors I could deal with and train out but the uneasiness around my son and subsequent bite really freaked me out. I drove the dog back to the rescue the next morning and requested my adoption fee back since this whole thing went south so quickly, less than 24 hours. I had dropped the dog off with a volunteer like the rescue instructed but since dropping off the dog the rescue has gone radio silent and not responding to my requests for a refund. I feel like I was duped in a way in to adopting a dog that obviously wasn’t good with toddlers, and now that they have my money they are MIA. I did sign something saying the adoption fee in non refundable now looking back through all the papers. Should I just accept I’m never seeing my money again and cut my losses? 
Also if this isn’t the right place to ask this please disregard.

689,dogs,"Hello everyone. I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting issues, and I'm also in fits just thinking about this, so I'm sorry if my post seems cluttered or hard to understand. Please don't judge me too harshly for asking this question. I'm trying my best to navigate this situation but need some outside advice. 

I have an 8 year old Australian Shepherd. He is the best dog I've ever owned, despite his issues. He's well trained and has excellent manners. I found him online when he was 2 years old, and he came from an extremely abusive situation, and our vet said he has some brain damage. When he was 4 years old, he was diagnosed with epilepsy and also started presenting with fits of rage. During these episodes, he turns viscious, and will attack anything that moves. As soon as it's over, he normally collapses and spends the rest of the day lethargic and recovering. 

Under constant vet care, we have been able to mitigate most of the issues caused by this, and the incidents happen less than once every 2-3 months. He has seizures every 3-6 months. However, in the last month, things have gotten pretty bad. The vet told me I would reach a point where he would be too much of a liability, and I would have to face some tough choices. 

I also have a teacup Chihuahua mix, who only weighs about 3 pounds. She is my other dogs best friend. He is fiercely protective of his little sister. They are never left unattended together because of the Aussie's issues. Three weeks ago, my Aussie picked her up and flung her into the wall out of nowhere. She was ok, but it was still a bit scary because this did not happen inside of an episode. They were laying in the floor fine one minute and the next he was shaking her and flung her into the wall. 

A week ago we were on a walk, when my Aussie saw a piece of food on the ground. In my attempt to redirect him, he ended up attacking me. He jumped up and grabbed my chest area, and it took my husband and I both to get him off of me. He did not break the skin , but he left a nasty bruise. He also bit my husband during this incident. This is not the first time he has bitten me, but it again, was the first time it happened outside of a rage episode. He has started snapping at strangers when we walk past them outside. This is a new behavior, and I've been doing everything I can to try to stop it, but it's rapidly getting worse, to a point where I'm feeling unsafe around him. I feel like we are having to walk on eggshells around him. He is now muzzled (I muzzle trained him when I first got him) any time he is going to be around people or animals. Including my husband and I now. 

In the last week he has had 2 seizures and 3 rage episodes. I was able to catch all 5 incidents before they happened so no one was injured or at risk. 

I cannot in good faith rehome him, because I don't want him to hurt someone else. I'm trying everything I know to do, but I'm starting to think that I may be at the point my vet was talking about. I don't want to give up on him, but he has become a danger to me and the people I love the most. My parents told me it is time to put him down, but I'm not willing to jump to that option before asking an outside opinion.",t2_a4tv25cp,0,Advice for biting dog,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zpvk2y,True,ExCoCThrowaway,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zpvk2y/advice_for_biting_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zpvk2y/advice_for_biting_dog/,2472985,1671465979,0,,False,1671465995,1671465996,2022-12-19 16:06:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like this is mainly my fault as I avoid them since a couple idiots refuse to leash their dogs and have them run around the street while they sit on their phones “watching them”. She’s 95 pounds and pretty good on her leash, rarely ever pulls. The issue is, everytime I walk by dogs she pulls towards them and goes into a play bow (no vocalization). I feel horrible when she does this because she disrupts others walks and I don’t want her causing other dogs to have issues. I am talking to her trainer today to ask if he can help, but what should I do until he can help and after? I’ve tried tossing treats for her to find, having rigorous play before walks, and flat out avoiding. I’ve also had multiple people walk up with their little dogs to “say hi” which is scary for me and her (she’s always been iffy around little dogs, not aggressive just nervous).

700,dogs,"So this is a problem I never thought I’d have,
I have had dogs before, even from the same breed and never experienced this.

I currently have a 2 1/2 yo Golden Retriever, I love him he is my everything but there is one thing he does that I just can’t get around.

He eats shit, literally, not his own or other dogs’, but anyone else’s shit. Cats? Loves it. Fox? Amazing. Horse? Gourmet. Human? Adores it. 

It is honestly disgusting, and I struggle with it extra as I have Autism+ADHD and germs are something that is a big Nono, these type of situations will send me into a meltdown and will shut off all my feelings to the point where I can only do minimal contact with the dog until I forget about what happened.(Animal poop is not so bad for me as I grew up in a farm, however, human poop is the one that makes me spiral out of control)(I normally have other people to help me if I find myself in this situation bc I honestly cannot even look at him) 

Since I get very upset it can be scary for him specially as I’m brushing his teeth while crying my lungs out, when I have meltdowns I cry very loudly, and I’m very extremely furious and disgusted so overall not a good vibe.

And apparently in my area there are a lot of humans pooping outside (this has happened at least 6-8 times in the last 4months).

I live in a semi-rough area so a lot of people seem to be shitting outside.

I really love this dog, he is my everything,he helps me a lot and in everything else we are a perfect match, but I just don’t know what to do to stop him from eating poop.

I tried a muzzle but he is too smart and keeps taking it off, I also check where he is walking but he got very good at eating without me noticing until too late, and I’m tired of touching his mouth to check.

What can I do to stop this? Is honestly making me think he would be better with someone else that might have more tolerance for this? My autism doesn’t really affect much about being a dog owner except my reactions to certain behaviours..(tbh only the poop one I cannot control how I react as it’s immediate meltdown and when it happens all my clarity is used to return home clean him asap and have the meltdown there.

Is this problem fixable? I’m willing to do whatever is best for him, I feel very bad after my meltdowns bc I know I wasn’t nice to him.. I get so angry I’m afraid I’ll lose it one day :(

Is there a way to avoid this? I’d really appreciate advise on how to help him(and me) I really don’t want to lose him 😞",t2_ur98jq8c,0,Dog keeps eating human or any other animal poop,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zpppn5,True,Scary_Ad_3453,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zpppn5/dog_keeps_eating_human_or_any_other_animal_poop/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zpppn5/dog_keeps_eating_human_or_any_other_animal_poop/,2472928,1671451296,0,,False,1671451309,1671451309,2022-12-19 12:01:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

705,dogs,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

\*  I once had a rescue collie cross, followed by a ridgeback.   

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  

\* Breeder  

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Small-Medium (ideally around 20kg or smaller)  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* Border collie or something similar with shorter hair? We want a dog to jog with, hike with, run around with that is not too big and is good in a family home with parents working from home. High energy is fine, but a lower-energy dog that can hike or run then chill is also fine. Good off-leash and not prone to aggressiveness to other dogs is more important than energy level.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* Basic obedience, disengagement, impulse control, games/mental stimulation at home.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

\* Nope.  

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* As much time as the dog needs. We are active and able to handle a high-energy dog, but if someone recommends a dog that is more lazy when not out hiking and playing, that's fine too (our ridgeback was much like that).

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* 1-2 hours. Jogging/cycling/walking/frisbee/games at home. Dog park is nearby.  Long hikes at the weekends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* Happy to brush daily but equally I'm not going to complain about NOT having to brush daily! I don't care too much on that front. Don't want any breed that requires a professional groomer too often though.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Small to medium. 20kg ish or less  

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* We can handle  some but would prefer less of all the above of course. Worst of these for me is drooling. Prefer hair over drool!

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* One of my top priorities, actually probably the top priority. 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Not bothered either way.  

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\* Eager to please. For reference I once had a collie cross and then a Rhodesian Ridgeback, and I MUCH preferred the collie cross's eagerness to follow instructions and pay attention to me. That's what I want again. The RR was very frustrating in many ways and I want to avoid that.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* Friendly or ignore. Either is fine. I do not want a guard dog.  

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* Obviously I'm willing to do so if I have to for some reason, but I absolutely do not want a dog that is prone to this.   

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* I would prefer a dog that is friendly to strangers/other dogs OR happy/easily trained to ignore them. Honestly ignoring other dogs would be great for us actually.  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* Once or twice a week when we all go out to somewhere dogs aren't allowed. I.e. supermarket (sometimes we all go), cinema, friend's birthday lunch, etc. Or a day trip on the very odd occasion. So a few hours here and there basically.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* Partner has similar preferences and will be equally involved in walking/training/mental stimulation.  

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* No

  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* We have 2 children aged between 5 and 10. They have friends over sometimes. 

  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\* No

  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? 

 \* Portugal. No bans but low availability of many breeds that are common in the UK/USA.  

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Temperate climate. Around 30-35C (85-95F)  in summer and around 10C (50F)  in winter.

707,dogs,"Wondering if anyone has experience with dogs that simply does not like a crate, unless it's on his own terms? 

For about a year now.  we have been doing everything we are ""supposed"" to be doing. We feed him every meal in the crate. We give him all of his toys in the crate. We give him treats in the crate. We praise him effusively when he gets in the crate himself. 

he's now at the point where he regularly seeks the crate out for naps and to avoid non-preferred tasks, like baths. He'll happily sleep for hours in the crate with the door closed - if he happened to choose to enter the crate in the first place, and if he happened to be sleepy. 

BUT he only likes the crate on his own terms, If I put him in there and he doesn't want to be, he will cry and bark and cry and bark incessantly. Sometimes he'll give up and settle; sometimes, however it will go on for an hour and not stop. If it's at 2 am, like right now, I can only let him bark for so long and will have to wait until he calms down and let him out (no, he does not have to pee. He just does not want to be in the crate. He wants to be running around the house barking at nothing, which is why I put him in there - hoping he would settle. 

Apparently at doggie day care and at the dog groomer, he's perfectly fine in the crate, with no complaints. He even spends the night crated at doggie day care without a single protest. I asked the doggie day care owner why she thinks that he's happy in the crate at doggie day care but not here at home and she said well, he knows that this is just how it is here.

However in the cooler months (now) her licking gets worse, which means secondary infections on her paw pads. I usually need a vet trip, antibacterial cream, anti itch tablets &amp; hibiscrub soap.

I have been popping her cone on only at night time to stop her licking. I've been doing this for 3 weeks and felt her licking had subsided therefore tried with no cone at night. However, looking back on the camera, she licks for a good 30 mins which will eventually make her paws sore &amp; raw again if this continues.

716,dogs,"Hey all.

I'm a dad to 2 kids (4.5 and 2.5).  We have a black lab mix who is all about our kids except at bed time.  She has her dog bed in our room that she usually likes to sleep in, but sometimes she'll snuggle up with my wife in our bed.

Over the last few weeks, my oldest has been spending a lot of time with the dog.  More than usual.  I guess she just got more into having a dog.  My lab already loved the kids, but tonight was a trip.

After bath, I take my 4.5 y/o daughter into her room for tuck in/book time (my wife handles the little one).  The dog decides, first time ever, to join us.  Jumps right into my daughter's bed and plops down at the foot.  So we do story time, my daughter doses off, and I get up to leave.  I figure the dog will follow me.  Nope.  She's snoring in the kid's bed too.  I nudge her awake, tell her to come, and close my daughter's door behind us.  Dog immediately whines and scratches at the door.  I don't want my kid to wake up, so I open it.  Dog jumps right back into the bed and goes back to sleep.  I leave the door open in case the dog wants to come to our room without waking the kid.

I stay up late to watch a movie.  Head upstairs expecting to see a black lab in my room.  Nope.  I check my daughter's room - 60lbs of black lab is laying next to my kid and my daughter has her arm over the dog like a stuffed animal.

We've had our lab since she was a puppy (7 y/o now) and before we had kids.  She's been in love with our kids since we brought them home.  Plays with them, tolerates less gentle pets, just a great dog.  Tonight though, tonight got me in the feels.

It didn’t do anything - he was frantic outside,  aware of every little noise when he was on lounging on the couch, sprinted room to room playing with a ball, followed me everywhere around the house as usual. I tried 50 mg trazodone and 100mg gabapentin today - still did all the things above. There was one moment where I thought maybe I could see a little difference - after about 6-7 hrs he was in a deepish sleep, slightly snoring which I haven't seen. He didn't open his eyes at every little noise, but when I got off the couch he immediately followed.

I'm talking to my vet about options and I know there's room to go up on the trazodone and gabapentin. I'm also working with a trainer/behaviorist as well for conditioning/desensitization techniques.

730,dogs,"Hi, r/dogs friends. My dog’s vet had been recommending a cleaning since this summer, but I was waiting until student loan forgiveness hit for some extra cash. It seems like it’s gotten a little more urgent (breath is extra stinky, does the teeth chattering thing that is common among dogs with dental issues, etc.), so I’ve scheduled his first cleaning since I adopted him shortly after Christmas.

That said, part of the reason I’d been hesitant about it was my anxiety about him being put under. He’s fixed, so I know he’s been under before—but it was before I got him. He’s always been in good health the 3-4 years I’ve had him, and I have no reason to be anxious about anesthesia other than the fact he’s a smaller dog.

Still, I’m really anxious about it—worried something will go wrong, that I’ll lose my best friend unexpectedly, or that they’re going to tell me his quality of life will be reduced due to some larger issue.

733,dogs,"18 months old Rhodesian Ridgeback,  had one heat and was spayed 4 weeks ago.

Prior to being spayed she was cuddly and friendly, accommodating to all of us, but especially the kids,  and was very easy going when socializing at the dog park. 

Since being spayed, there have been a few subtle but concerning changes.  She's more vocal- grumbling and growling which she NEVER not once did before.  She no longer wants anyone cuddled up near her and this is an issue because she's 85 pounds and takes up half the couch,  she's growled at me and the kids when we're on the couch with her if we even slightly move. She just nipped at me (also never even threatened this before spay) when she laid down on my feet on the couch and I pulled them out from under her when they started to fall asleep. 

At the dog park, she's not exactly aggressive, but much more assertive and less easy going. Other dog parents at the park that know us have noticed and commented on this change.

735,dogs," 

Hi everyone, I'm looking to get a dog in 2023 and filled out the questionnaire as I am seeking breed recommendations. Thank you in advance for anyone that reads this posts and provides any feedback. The auto formatting of the questionnaire isn’t coming out the way it should, sorry about that. 

\*\*Introduction\*\*

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Yes

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Prefer a rescue as I don't feel that I'm ready to handle a puppy.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

\* A small to medium size dog that always wants to be by my side; minimal shedding; minimal drooling; Energy level where going for multiple walks per day, 30-60 minutes of fetch and a occasional hike would be sufficient for exercise needs; not an excessive barker ; Enjoys learning new commands.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* A friend of mine has West Highland White Terrier and I enjoyed being around him but noticed this dog seemed independent whereas I'm looking for a velcro personality. A second breed that caught my attention was a GSP but I feel that the energy level of a GSP might be outside my comfort zone. So there isn't a particular breed that I've come across that I feel would be a perfect fit. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Definitely the general stuff (sit, stay, rollover, leave it and etc). I already plan on using local dog training resources that will help me train from basic to advance obedience.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* 2-4 hours of direct interaction with the dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* I expect 2 walks (30 minutes each) and possibly two more short walks (10-15 minutes) mixed in. Then 30-60 minutes or more of intense exercise such as fetch.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* A daily brush would be just fine with me. I feel comfortable with cleaning ears but any trimming needs would be done by a local professional.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* Small to medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Doesn't bark excessively; minimal slobber; low amount of shedding is preferred. Medium amount of shedding may be fine as long I learn what needs to be done to manage it.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not important but would be great.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Eager-to-please

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Barks to alert and then when a stranger or visitor enters, the dog will greet them with some sniffs or licks.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Any form of aggression as I currently don't have experience handling those types of behavior.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* My only experience with dogs is volunteering to do dog walks for my local animal shelter.

I notice that Golden Retriever and Labs are frequently recommended for new owners. I've only been around a lab once who was about 3 years old and I found it very overwhelming how energetic it was and having all that weight on me when it would constantly jump up on me.

I'm no longer in school, work 100% from home, financially comfortable and having a stable living situation.

736,dogs,"I have a 14 y/o Jack Russell/Border Collie mix. He was in excellent health until recently. 

In early-mid November, he ran into a yard sign and injured his left eye. I checked it out immediately and it seemed ok, so I thought he was fine. A few days later, it was obvious that there was something going on (conjunctivitis, squinting.) I took him to the vet and they gave us Dorzolamide to treat pressure and Neomycin ointment to help with inflammation and treat/prevent an infection. At a follow-up a week later, they said he had lost all vision and to continue with the ointment indefinitely, but discontinue the Dorzolamide. 

A week or so after that, I took him to a different vet for a second opinion. She agreed he was non-visual, and said I could discontinue the Neomycin ointment. Eye pressures were normal in both eyes (20). During a physical exam she noticed that he has a grade 3-4 heart murmur and prescribed Pimobendan.  

A few days after that, his eye began looking worse (conjunctivitis). I took him back in and was told to continue the Neomycin ointment (they also gave me Neomycin drops, and said I could use them interchangeably.) Eye pressures were still normal. He was given Vetprofen to help with pain.

A week later (this past Wednesday), I took him back to the second vet because he developed diarrhea, which I attributed to the Vetprofen. He was also behaving unusual (almost lethargic, not eating/drinking.) To me, his eye was looking better, but the vet said it looked like he was developing glaucoma. She rechecked pressures and the IOP in the injured eye was 47. She told me to resume the Dorzolamide 3 times per day, and the Neomycin 3-4 times per day. They also ran blood work and everything was completely normal, so aside from the eye injury and heart murmur, he is totally fine. She told me that if we can’t get it under control, we will have to look at enucleation. She alluded to putting him to sleep because he is a surgical risk given his age and heart murmur.

Last night, his eye began looking slightly larger. I took him to the vet as soon as they opened today (Sunday). Eye pressure had decreased to 40, but she agreed that it looked slightly larger. He is now taking Dorzolamide with Timolol twice a day, and Neomycin 3-4 times per day. 

He is not behaving as though he is in pain. He is extremely energetic given his age, and hasn’t slowed down a bit (aside from earlier this week when he had diarrhea.)

I need opinions on what others would do if faced with the choice of putting a 14 year old dog with a grade 3-4 heart murmur through surgery with anesthesia, or putting him to sleep. 

Obviously, euthanasia is not my first choice, but if I opt for the surgery and he survives, I don’t want to selfishly keep him alive if he is going to suffer.",t2_allnkvfn,0,14 y/o dog with eye injury (glaucoma) - what to do?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zphs6l,True,BlkCardi,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zphs6l/14_yo_dog_with_eye_injury_glaucoma_what_to_do/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zphs6l/14_yo_dog_with_eye_injury_glaucoma_what_to_do/,2472845,1671423835,0,,False,1671423847,1671423848,2022-12-19 04:23:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
737,dogs,"My pup loves being around other pups and has been in daycare often. I have never had any complaints about my dog but today the rover boarder gave me my first negative feedback: that my dog gets scared and pees. This was my first time leaving my dog overnight with this rover. The week prior I had her stay for daycare to get used to them. My pup when I picked her up from daycare showed signs of anxiety and was ready to go home. I decided it was likely just that- anxiety from being there for the first time. When she got home she spent about full 5 minutes just drinking water. A week goes by and my pup gets dropped off to be boarded overnight. As soon as we enter the home, the rover person goes to pet her and my dog starts trembling and pees. I felt horrible and cleaned it up. No cleaner in sight… asked them for some spray and they said wiping it is good enough. You’d think a rover person would have enzyme cleaner. No updates whatsoever just a “best pic I could get” at midnight of a blurry picture of half her face. When I picked her up rover person let me know the negative feedback that she’s a rescue (she’s not..) and is skiddish so she pees inside and is scared of him so she runs away from him. Said she refused to go inside from backyard because he was at door and had to drag her in via her collar. Peeing inside is not okay. My dog rarely pees inside. Never had a boarding place say she’s skiddish or pees. Again she’s standing by the door ready to go and once she’s home runs straight to the water.

We’ve tried two different options, “hard boots” either didn’t fit her paws or wouldn’t stay on.  We also just tried a set of rubber soled neoprene boots with Velcro, they stay on for a little bit but even those fall off.

756,dogs,"Hey folks, I’m hoping you can help me with a puppy problem.  

Little back story, my parents rescued two dogs about two years ago, one that immediately got claimed by my dad and the other went to me when I went back to school. My dog (let’s call him Allan) was raised as a stray and my parents never really took any time to train him while he was living with them. Allan has a lot of anxiety, and separation anxiety, while the other (Marty) came from a nice house but was used to being the only dog. They got along well enough when they lived with my parent, had some small issues but overall got along well.  

As planned, I took Allan to school and his anxiety got a lot better, and managed to train him some. We are visiting home for the holidays and I brought Allan home as well.  

When I took Allan off to school, my parents ended up getting another puppy that they have also not trained at all or very little. He’s a husky mix and is very vocal, but the main problem is he nips continuously and will bite fully sometimes. Marty has gotten mostly used to the puppy during their time.  

Allan, on the other hand, is having a tough time with the puppy as he has gotten pretty used to being a lone pet. The puppy would bite  at Allan or myself, and he would bare teeth and occasionally snap at the puppy and my parents praised him for it to “get the puppy put in its place.” I was not happy with this but we’d gotten in literally two hours before and didn’t want to start the holidays with an argument (stupid ik).  

My brother and I were playing with all three and Allan fell on Morty who was already being jumped on by the puppy, Marty jumped up and started attacking Allan, who fought back before I stepped between them and threw them apart. I  yelled at both of the dogs, the puppy remained completely oblivious the entire time.  

My dad and I disciplined our respective dogs, I thought it was done but I was petting Allan and found a cut on Allan’s snout from where it looks like Marty got a bite in.  

My question is how tf do I get these dogs to get along while I am home for the holidays??? I spoke to my parents and they don’t entend on doing anything about the puppy biting.

My dog got so excited yesterday he jumped on the bed and walked over our heads. Granted both of us were laughing at how exicted my dog was, but it's kind of annoying when you're trying to go to sleep.

The issue is that the new guy has terrible sleeps because my dog likes to be everywhere. My dog likes to get up and wonder between rooms, walks around the bedroom, and doesn't know where to go when he does come back to bed. I have gotten up at night and let him know he's welcome, but to only my side so new guy can sleep peacefully. 

I feel bad because while it's nice waking up to another human, new guy said he probrably won't sleep over again because my dog doesn't like sharing the bed.  I think it's because new guy is not used to sharing a queen sized bed with a person and her large dog when he sleeps. Perhaps they both need to see more of each other. Maybe I need a larger bed.

763,dogs,"I would like to get a puppy this coming year and due to allergies I've decided to get a poodle (likely standard, but still could be a mini) and due to my living situation I'm forced to get a female dog. I don't mind this I would love a girl, however, i have wanted to get a puppy that is at least 4 months old. This is because I'm a college student and I can't rely on my other house member to be entirely consistent with the puppy whenever I'm gone for school, so a super young 8-10 week puppy wouldn't be an option for me. I also am not getting the puppy now and instead plan for it to be for next summer. However I am worried that I won't be able to find what I'm looking for with reputable breeders. I have seen some puppies that match what I want but they are not always part of the PCA and range from highly questionable to seemingly really good. I guess part of the question is if a breeder does all the required testing and has good practices but they aren't part of a club, can they be considered reputable? I could really use some more insight on this as I've been having really bad anxiety regarding the worst outcome of just not finding a puppy",t2_5mmrb7sz,0,how rare is it for reputable breeders to have older puppies available,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zpds9m,True,tired_mouse,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zpds9m/how_rare_is_it_for_reputable_breeders_to_have/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zpds9m/how_rare_is_it_for_reputable_breeders_to_have/,2472795,1671412124,0,,False,1671412135,1671412135,2022-12-19 01:08:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
764,dogs,"Title pretty much says everything it needs to. I’ve seen similar posts but just wanted to share where I’m at, my thought process and ask for some advice. 

I’ve had my dog for 2 years now, she’s some sort of shepherd mix. Don’t really know since I get her from a rescue. Anyway, I got her when I was living at home with my mom and her dog. When I first got her, looking back now, I realized that I had all of the benefits of having a dog with little to no responsibility. I work a 9-5 and at the time when I was with my mom I lived about an hour from work so I would leave at 8 in the morning and get home around 6-7pm. So I wasn’t involved with taking care of my dog during the day. I would get home, play, run around the yard, snuggle and go to sleep. Pretty great right? Important note that my mom had gotten a puppy about a year ago so for the first year and a half my dog had 1/2 dogs to spend time with and my mom worked remote so she was able to take the dogs outside and let them run around cause she is on an acre of land. 

Fast forward to where I am now. I moved out and now live in a ~600sqft one bedroom apartment. I still work a 9-5 but love only 15 minutes from work. I no longer have a yard where I can simply let her out and everything is on me. I take her on a quick walk in the morning before I go to work and then she gets back on the couch and goes to sleep when I leave. I come home for lunch, take her outside to go to the bathroom and again when I get home. It’s the weekends and evenings that are starting to drive me crazy. I am pretty lazy and sometimes just want to lounge and read/watch tv. Lately she’s been extremely anxious and constantly wanting to go out. I have grown to resent my dog and no longer want to keep her around. It’s also partially for the freedom. This is my first time living on my own and while in theory I have all the freedom I could think of I’m constantly worrying about leaving my dog alone or have to arrange someone to take care of her. 

Note: there are no behavioral issues, she is a very well behaved dog she just needs more exercise and I don’t want to do that. Maybe it sounds very selfish of me but I’d rather rehome her and both of us be more happy instead of resenting her and things potentially getting worse.

They also require a backyard which for many reasons I think is a misguided way of knowing if a person will be a good dog owner or not. But what really gets me is that you have to be over 21 and have your own place. Shouldn't the character of the person matter more? Or the actual reality of their situation? What if someone still lives with their parents because they are saving up for a house and their parents have a huge backyard like they often require? And if the person moves out but goes to an apartment then it's still not allowed. Some cultures also prefer to stay living with their parents until much later.

768,dogs,"Hi everyone, I'm looking to get a dog in 2023 and filled out the questionnaire as I am seeking breed recommendations. Thank you in advance for anyone that reads this posts and provides any feedback. If there is any additional information you would like from me please let me know. 

\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  

\* Prefer a rescue as I don't feel that I'm ready to handle a puppy. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* A small to medium size dog that always wants to be by my side; minimal shedding; minimal drooling;   Energy level where going for multiple walks per day, 30-60 minutes of fetch and a occasional hike would be sufficient for exercise needs; not an excessive barker ; Enjoys learning new commands. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* A friend of mine has West Highland White Terrier and I enjoyed being around him but noticed this dog seemed independent whereas I'm looking for a velcro personality. A second breed that caught my attention was a GSP but I feel that the energy level of a GSP might be outside my comfort zone. So there isn't a particular breed that I've come across that I feel would be a perfect fit. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* Definitely the general stuff (sit, stay, rollover, leave it and etc). I already plan on using local dog training resources that will help me train from basic to advance obedience.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\*  2-4 hours of direct interaction with the dog. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* I expect 2 walks (30 minutes each) and possibly two more short walks (10-15 minutes) mixed in. Then 30-60 minutes or more of intense exercise such as fetch.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* A daily brush would be just fine with me. I feel comfortable with cleaning ears but any trimming needs would be done by a local professional. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Small to medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Doesn't bark excessively; minimal slobber; low amount of shedding is preferred. Medium amount of shedding may be fine as long I learn what needs to be done to manage it. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* Not important but would be great. 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Snuggly!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\* Eager-to-please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* Barks to alert and then when a stranger or visitor enters, the dog will greet them with some sniffs or licks.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* Any form of aggression as I currently don't have experience handling those types of behavior.   

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* I work from home so 1-6 hours about 2-3 times per week. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* My wife's involvement will be pretty minimal outside of giving affection, I am taking 100% responsibility of the dog. Her dog-related preferences that she made clear to me was low amounts of shedding and drooling. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* No other pets but in two to four years will like to add a second dog to the family.  

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* Not right now but my wife and I are hoping to start having children in two years.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

\* My only experience with dogs is volunteering to do dog walks for my local animal shelter. 

\*  I notice that Golden Retriever and Labs are frequently recommended for new owners. I've only been around a lab once who was about 3 years old and I found it very overwhelming how energetic it was and having all that weight on me when it would constantly jump up on me. 

 \* I'm no longer in school, work 100% from home, financially comfortable and having a stable living situation.

773,dogs," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs and we had a doodle in a too small house with no back yard for 2 months over a decade ago before our second baby says born that was quickly rehomed to a family member with teen kids and an acre of land. That experience made me swear off even considering another dog until all my kids could put their own shoes on by themselves and/or I could leave them home alone if I take it for a walk/run. And here we are. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would *prefer* getting a dog from a shelter but we're leaning toward a breeder because it doesn't seem the type of dogs we're looking for are available often from shelters in our area. We're keeping our eyes open though. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* medium size, ideally hypoallergenic (I mean, does anyone *like* cleaning up all the fur shedding? But we'd be willing to compromise for the right dog), good with kids, friendly, not overly territorial, medium activity level, could join me on 3 mile runs.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* we've looked at some poodle mixes (golden retriever, Labrador, Burmese mountain dog), purebred poodle, Portuguese water dog, lagotto romagnolo, Bedlington Terrier, Irish water spaniel, and pug. We realize one of these is not like the others. All accept the pug seem to fit our low/no shedding preference, medium size, family friendliness, intelligence, and energy level (some of these are higher energy than would be ideal but we do have 5 kids). I've always just personally loved pugs. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* we haven't put a lot of thought into this, but I would say basic commands at least. We don't need to have a highly trained trick dog but I'm sure the kids would love to teach some (like fetch, sit, roll over, etc.) and one that's too hard to train would be frustrating for them. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* we don't do any competitive sports or hunting and live on a quarter acre in the a city. I do run 12-15 miles a week and as a women it would be nice, but not a requirement to have a dog that could join me when I'm running in the evening. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I'm currently a stay at home mom and we currently homeschool. Lots of people around all day for interaction. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* we live in a quiet neighborhood where we go on regular walks, I run, and we visit parks with large open areas but no dog parks. Probably at least an hour of exercise every day. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We're willing to do regular brushing/grooming and/or pay for regular grooming. We realize that these things would be especially necessary for a non-shedding dog.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium preferably. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* prefer low level of all of these things. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* our yard is a quarter acre unfenced in a neighborhood with lots of other dogs and kids, so fairly important unless we can tether. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* either is fine but, again, there are a lot of people in this house so the dog would have to be okay with sharing it's space. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* eager to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* we have people over often so it would need to be okay with strangers, or at least not super territorial. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* no

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* agression

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* probably not ever. The dog and I will have that in common.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* everyone else just wants a dog and is happy I'm now open to it. We're pretty big on giving our kids responsibilities so we expect them all to have a level of involvement in caring for it.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* we currently have a 7-year-old cat

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* yes.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* we own a 2700 sq ft, 2 story home

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* mid-sized midwestern US city. No laws banning any breeds that we know of.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

777,dogs,"We originally got turned down from adopting a dog I think because we were very young with a toddler. We have a fenced in yard, had dogs as children, etc. They just said no. The next day I was at an animal show and they had tiny baby shar peis. I know all about how terrible it is to buy dogs but I fell in love and that is how we got our cutie little girl. 

She and our son have grown up together. Cutie grew faster and would knock our son down when he came home. She even once grabbed some pizza out of his mouth and ate it! Then my son started to get big and they loved each other in a different way. Every morning Cutie would jump on the bed and squeeze between me and my husband to lay on top of him. You couldn’t get mad because she was just so loving. 

We’ve been through a lot with our Cutie. Now my son turns 18 next month and Cutie is around 16. That is a really long life for a shar-pei to my knowledge. 

Well one night we were sleeping in bed together and I got woken up to her shaking. As I looked up she was jumping off the bed. The next day she had a lot of trouble walking and was stumbling around like she was drunk. We took her to the vet and I think the vet is awful. The vet told us that she had arthritis and needed some joint supplements. We started to give her the supplements and she got much better. 

Ever since that time our Cutie has not been able to jump on the bed or couch anymore. We tried to get her stairs to our bed but she has trouble with stairs. Sometimes we will lift her up but she is around 55 lbs and we don’t want her to jump off before we can put her down in case it makes things worse. She is getting a senior’s bed for Christmas which we will giving her tomorrow. 

Yesterday the same thing happened. She started shaking her head back and forth and now she is falling down again. Her eyebrows are lifting when she is just laying there. She fell twice on the way out to the back yard on concrete this morning. 

Last year we had to put down our cat of 6 years because of an inoperable tumor on Dec 23. She still had gifts under the tree. Cutie took that hard and started peeing where we used to have the cat box but she stopped after a bit. 

Now I am just so sad. I hate to see her not be able to walk. Sometimes she will just wander around into a dead end and then turn around. I don’t know but I think she has some brain issues going on. 

We are hoping this clears up in a few days like last time. I just can’t stand to see her at the end of her life cycle.

785,dogs,"I'm finally in a position to get a dog on my own, and I'm hoping to get it within the next three months sometime. I grew up with family dogs, so I'm not completely new to having a dog in the household. However that was when I was a kid growing up, and while we loved and cared for our dogs, I'm not sure that we always had the best habits as owners (primarily when it came to training certain things). So I'm looking for advice and to get a few questions answered so that I can give my future dog the best possible care.

* Adult or senior? — For a variety of reasons, I am not looking at getting a puppy at this point in time.  So I'm going back and forth on whether to look into adopting an adult or a senior dog. On one hand, I love the idea of being able to give an older dog that's been stuck at the shelter for a while a loving home. But on the other hand, I know I would not have as much time with them as I would with a dog a few years younger than that. So I'm torn on which way to go.
* Apartment living — Somewhat tying in to the above question, I live in an apartment and don't have an enclosed yard. Any advice on what breed or what age would be best for this situation? I am looking to get a dog that's medium-large-ish in size. Think bigger than a corgi and same size or smaller than a labrador.
* Dog park — Since I don't have an enclosed yard for the dog to run around in, I plan on taking it to a dog park that's near by. However we never took our dogs to a dog park when I was growing up, so I don't know what I might need to do or worry about. What are some tips that I should keep in mind when taking the dog out to the dog park?
* Barking — One of the biggest things that my landlord is requiring is that the dog doesn't constantly bark. Does anyone have advice on quieter breeds or training to lessen the amount of barking that a dog does?

Daily he eats 230 g of high-calorie kibble + 1 meal with 150 g of pre-mixed barf meat, some veggies and fruit, and a small-sized meaty bone (chicken leg, chicken head etc.) + treats and chews (especially on training days and on walks more focused on obedience).

I’m not going to deny my dog is getting a little less attention these days, I still make sure she gets walked and we play fetch/tug while the baby is on her play mat (I’m sitting on the ground next to the baby) so she’s not getting completely neglected.

796,dogs,"**About the puppy and the situation:**  


1 year ago I got a German Shepard Puppy. After that, I got a girlfriend probably a few weeks after getting my puppy. Safe to say she imprinted on my girlfriend most likely. They get along great, actually too well. My girlfriend refuses to help keep my dog behaved. Letting her jump on her and lick her etc. Things I trained her not to do with strangers. The GS doesn't do this to other people. She is well trained, knows all basic commands and a few advanced ones. Very smart dog. I don't have a fenced yard, she knows to not run out of the yard and goes to the bathroom in the same spot every day. I can let her out the door, she will go do her business and then come back to the door and wait for me. Very smart dog, in my opinion anyway.  


**The Issue:**   
So when I had her for the first six months I kennel trained her. She loves her Kennel and is comfortable in it etc. Skip to today, We have started training her to have more freedoms over the last 6 months slowly eliminating the use for a Kennel. Well since we started doing this we've noticed an issue. When I leave the house. She is perfectly fine, behaves, and chews her toys only.  


When my girlfriend leaves, she INSTANTLY, no hesitation will go to something she knows she is not supposed to chew and destroys it. So fast that sometimes my gf leaves when I'm in the shower and I come out 5 minutes later to something destroyed in the house, a rug, car keys, clothes, you name it. And yes she jumped on the counter, grabbed the car keys, and chewed them to pieces, and yes I got her checked after, no keys inside or damage to teeth surprisingly. She must be half wolverine.  The one from Xmen not nature. Screw those things.... Anyways... I'm trying to figure out why this is. I'm looking for solutions. We try our best to dog-proof the house, and I don't want to resort to keeping her in a kennel all day as some days we both work long long hours and can't always get our neighbor to check on her.  If my gf leaves first and I'm home with the dog and leave later, there is never an issue when we come home.   


**What Ive done to this point:**  
I've slowly introduced her to being okay outside her kennel. Leaving for only minutes at a time and slowly growing the time, to come back so she doesn't freak out. Simply grabbing house leaving items like car keys coats etc and walking around, as she was reactive with those and immediately went to the door if I grabbed them. No longer does she do this.   


 I've given her training treats, taken her for walks, and given her plenty of exercise. I don't react when I get home and have gotten my girlfriend to not react when she leaves or comes home, so its not a big deal for the dogs. We come home do our thing for 5 minutes and then give the dog attention every time so its not some big celebratory event when we come home or leave. She gets a bathroom break before and after we come home as well.  


We tried anti chewing things like bitter yuck etc. This doesn't faze my dog in the slightest, she will eat literally anything with bitteryuck or not. I can feed her a piece of cardboard sprayed in bitteryuck and she will just lick it.   


I'm at a point where I'm scared she is going to destroy something expensive like my couches, the rugs were $300 plus. 

**The Solution:**  
I'm looking for positive reinforcement solutions. I really don't want to have her kenneled all the time. I don't think it's fair to her and like I said, she is not destructive at all when I leave so I know shes capable of being a good dog when were gone.

800,dogs,"Just wanted to get this community’s opinion on my situation. I have a very large (100lbs) 13.5 year old yellow lab who just grew a very aggressive  large mass in her eyelid. Her eyes are pretty inflamed and she is growing lumps faster by the day. She’s got them in her ears, mouth, body, head, everywhere. She’s also struggling to control her bowel movements and can’t wear diapers because she gets UTIs very often now (like every 2 months). She’s also got very bad osteoarthritis in her back hips now. 

We just don’t know if it’s fair to put her through a painful surgery at her age and will very likely grow more lumps in other sensitive areas soon. She’s already past the average life expectancy but there needs to a point where we consider alternative options.

803,dogs,"Last Friday, out of nowhere, we had to put our beautiful Korra to sleep. She came into our lives completely by chance 2 and a half years ago and we are so lost without her right now. Words cannot begin to describe how we feel, but I feel like sharing her story is helping with our grieving process.

At the start of Covid in 2020 my wife and I were looking for a dog but with everyone stuck at home, dogs were hard to find, puppies or recues. One random evening at work I found her being pulled out of a burning appartment, being taken away from the previous missing owner by force for animal neglect. I couldn't even tell at that time that she was a Border Collie because she was so covered in soot and burned/melted things. Called my wife and she brought her home, cleaned her and fed her.

The next day we brought her to the vet where we found she had a serious fever, weighed in at a measly 44lbs, severly malnourished and with a bad case of pyometra. The vet's best guess was she was between 4-5 years old and she had no identification on her or chips. Without the adoption paperwork even completed, we both agreed to fork the significant amount of money for the emergency spaying procedure to save her life. Turns out her uterus was so infected it was 11lbs in weight, out of her 44 total. We brought her home and cared for her during her recovery. The vet told us we had saved her life twice, by taking her in and doing the surgery. A dog that sick landing in a shelter or rescue would've been put down.

After she made a complete recovery she was the best of dogs. House trained, knew some tricks, never ever chewed or broke anything inside the house, always down for a walk/run/hike. Love to fetch, came with us on massive hikes, camping, car rides. She kept us comfortable and warm in bed. When I caught Covid she never left my side the whole time I was sick, only exited the room to go eat and use the bathroom. We eventually moved from a townhome to a massive property in the country where she was in heaven. She was free to roam and run everywhere, chase squirrels and wild life, eat all the grass, sniff all the plants, roll in all the animal poop she could find.

Come allergy season this late summer it seemed to hit her harder than usual. Took her to the vet, gave her allergy medication but for some reason she still seemed like it was affecting her. Lots of big sneezes and reverse sneezes. Kept going back to the vet to investigate, trying different things. About a month ago we woke up in the morning to a little bit of blood on our bed. Some blood was coming out when she sneezed sometimes out of her left nostril and her left sinus became swollen. Another trip to the vet, some pain medication with anti-inflammatories, some antibiotics and an appointment for a possible tooth/nose exploratory/surgery to figure out what is causing all of this. The bleedings became more frequent and would last a little longer. Korra usually slept on the bed at our feet. When she slept in between us and rested her head on our pillows, it meant something was seriously wrong. Woke up Friday morning with Korra resting her head on my pillow, some blood having drooped already. My wife was scared, thought she looked really off, I told her to keep an eye on her and to call me if something changed as I made my way to work.

Not long after having started working, my wife called me telling me that Korra was now severly bleeding and from the other nostril this time. I rushed back home to find her greeting me at the door like usual, tail wagging and all happy but covered in blood. Her front paws now stained red, her nose just pourring blood as she is furiously trying to lick it clean. My wife trying to take care of our 9 month old daughter and I just see it all over the floor...the blood, so much blood. I grap a tissue and try to see if good pressure can stop the blood, no luck. I call the vet, telling them I cannot stop her nose bleed and I am now very concerned. I'll never forget her answer...Emergency vet hospital now.

Packed our things and rushed her to the emergency. It was not looking good. With the age, the presentation, the progression and what we were seeing right now the vet said all signs point towards a tumor in her nose having erroded vessels inside and her sneezing ruptured major blood vessels. The staff tried as hard as they could to stop the bleeding. Pressure, ice, even epinephrine to see if constricting the blood vessels would help, no such luck. We were now faced with 3 impossible options. Keep her there at the hospital, blood transfusions, exploratory scope, CT scan and possible options for an amount of money that we simply did not have for maybe an extra year/month or simply be told there is nothing they can do anymore; bring her home and have her bleed to death; or do the humane thing and stop her suffering.

We had to do the toughest thing we ever did. I had to sign the piece of paper that gave them the permission for euthanasia. Sign the paper to kill our best friend... The guilt is real, even if looking back, it was the only option that made sense. Still healthy enough, surrounded by the ones she loved, to go to sleep. She was brought in the room where we got to spend final moments with her. Even after all their efforts, the bleeding had gotten worse, now fully flowing from both nostrils...we didn't want to have her suffer anymore. She went to sleep surrounded by her humans, with lots of hugs and treats at 1400 on Friday. It was without a doubt the worst moment of my life.

When we came back home, we had so much blood to clean up. The house was so empty...

Yesterday I had to clear the snow in the driveway when I saw them, paw prints in the tire tracks coming from the street and disappearing underneath the car. We like to think the Korra's spirit followed us home that night, to watch over us and be with us always. Her remains will eventually come back to us and we will bury them under the beautiful Sugar Maple at our pond which will now be named Korra's Pond so she can be with us always.

A short 2 and half years but she gave us so much love and we loved her so much.

Do me a favor and give an extra hug to your dog or cat or pet for me. You never know when might be your last. This completely blind sided us and our lives are shattered right now. In our heads she was scheduled for the operation in 2 days and we were going to fix what ever was bothering her. But it was not to be so. I know it is ""cliche"" but ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened"".

806,dogs,"So more specifics.

Someone let their large dog loose in the apartment building, appeared to be a mastiff. Ran into it in the morning and it growled and barked back at me, forcing me to back away calmly from my apartment's door and go outside. I think I made the mistake of making eye-contact and trying to act dominant which apparently you're not supposed to do with an seemingly-aggressive, especially large dog. I feel I can't get around it without getting too close because the corridors in the building are fairly small.

Later as I was outside, I saw the lone dog roaming the parking lot. I assumed someone had an encounter with this dog and let it out of the building. It spotted me but the dog pretty much ignored me this time around. To be specific, I'm kind of unsure of this, but it seemed to be a bit more playful. It kept jumping around as if it expected me to come near him which I didn't, I just ignored the dog and later the dog ignored me.

Much later after that, I saw the owner pull the dog back into their apartment which is just next door to me. Turns out to be my neighbor's dog. I get the impression its owner felt like the dog, being so big, needed to go outside or that he didn't want it in the house for a while and that the dog was ""guarding"" his owner's apartment which is just next to mines and it's pretty close to the building's entryway and barks at anyone who comes in. It appeared to be trained but you never know what these big dogs might do when they start growling at people they're not familiar with.

Regardless, I know families live here and children often come through the building with their own dogs, so I do think its odd to let such a big, strong dog roam around without supervision.

If I ever have another encounter with this mastiff, or a similarly large dog, and I HAVE to get through and that there is no way to go around the dog without getting too close, what do I do? It only happened once in the five months I've lived here but I do fear this encounter will happen again if the dog owner is willing to let the mastiff roam about like this.

My Goberian Shadow is just shy of turning 1 year old. I usually feed him organic Purina that I get from Chewey, and even if he didn’t eat it dry he would eat it if I put some warm water on it. Usually if he seems like he’s being picky I can play some games and get him to eat. But this past week he doesn’t want to eat kibble. Every time I try to get him to eat some he either runs away from the bowl or will turn his face away from kibble. Granted he does have some soft poops the last few days.

He still drinks water. He will accept treats. He comes to work with me and I figured maybe people give him too many. So I stopped that.

Due to thinking his stomach may be upset I tried giving some greens beans mixed in with the kibble. He ate all the green beans and barely any kibble.

Today he keeps going over to his bowl and sniffing it followed by licking his lips. He does do this weird thing where he nudged his bowel and will whine. 

I feed him Iams right now until his Chewey order gets here.

811,dogs,"We have a large dog (~85ish lbs) who’s a year and a half old and sweet as can be, but she doesn’t know how to jump. 

When she was a puppy, we had a sedan and she’d put her front paws up and we’d lift her back into the car. We assumed that it was because of the door and the roof and she was afraid of hitting something. Fine, whatever. 

Then we got a larger SUV, and we figured she’d learn over time, but no. She still puts her front paws up and waits for us to lift her into the car. This was clearly a failure on our part, but now we’d like to rectify it. 

If she’s running around the back yard, or on a hike, she’ll jump a couple inches to clear a root or a rock, but that’s about it. 

How do I teach her how to jump so she can clear obstacles on more rugged hikes or even just up into the trunk of the SUV?

812,dogs,"So more specifics.

Someone let their large dog loose in the apartment building, appeared to be a mastiff. Ran into it in the morning and it growled and barked back at me, forcing me to back away calmly from my apartment's door and go outside. I think I made the mistake of making eye-contact and trying to act dominant which apparently you're not supposed to do with an seemingly-aggressive, especially large dog. I feel I can't get around it without getting too close because the corridors in my apartment are somewhat spacious but fairly small.

Later as I was outside, I saw the lone dog roaming the parking lot. I assumed someone else let it out. It spotted me but the dog pretty much ignored me this time around. To be specific, I'm kind of unsure of this, but it seemed to be a bit more playful. It kept jumping around as if it expected me to come near him which I didn't, I just ignored the dog and later the dog ignored me.

Much later after that, I saw the owner pull the dog back into their apartment which is just next door to me. Turns out to be my neighbor's dog. I get the impression its owner felt like the dog, being so big, needed to go outside or that he didn't want it in the house for a while and that the dog was ""guarding"" his owner's apartment which is just next to mines and it's pretty close to the building's entryway and barks at anyone who comes in. It appeared to be trained but you never know what these big dogs might do when they start growling at people they're not familiar with.

Regardless, I know families live here and children often come through the building and I think its odd to let such a big, strong dog roam around without supervision.

If I ever have another encounter with this mastiff, or a similarly large dog, and I HAVE to get to my apartment door, which is just right next to the dog owner's apartment, and that there is no way to go around the dog without getting too close, what do I do? It only happened once in the five months I've lived here but I do fear this encounter will happen again if the dog owner is willing to let the mastiff roam about like this.

With all that said, never understood people's fear of dogs until now.

Yet, I constantly see people ask questions about their new litter or people supporting specialized breeders. I don’t get it. If you love dogs, why buy a dog? There are sooooooo many good dogs up for adoption. Supporting breeders, even responsible ones, just ensure that the cycle continues (supply &amp; demand), the moment consumers stop the demand people will stop breeding.

819,dogs,"
Apologies for the long post. I am a first time dog owner. We got a dog for the family based on some good experiences dog sitting a friend's 30-lb mixed breed.

I found a listing for a ""spanador"" puppy. Spanadors/cockerdors are cocker spaniel and labrador mix. The woman said the father was a 25lb cocker spaniel and the mother a 50lb lab, and she expected the puppies would end up at 30-35lbs. I took her at her word and we got a puppy! 

I have since learned that parent size is not necessarily an indication of adult size. If the labrador genes are more prominent, this puppy could grow to be 60+ lbs. She already has huge paws and gained 2lbs this week. (She's 13lbs at 10 weeks.)

I'm freaking out. I didn't want a large dog and I'm feeling really blindsided. I'm going to keep this dog no matter the size, but I find myself filled with anxiety and some grief, thinking about what I wanted that I'm not going to get. Luckily we have a house with a yard and older kids, so there's nothing physically wrong here except that this isn't what I wanted.

One of my friends thinks it's on me for getting a lab mix, ""surely you knew this dog could get to be big,"" and to that I say, honestly no I did not. I know very little and I listened to what the woman said. (It was not a ""breeder"" as this woman breeds labs and this was an accidental litter.) Maybe she duped me because everyone wants a nice medium sized dog. We also went with a puppy and not an older rescue for several reasons I won't get in to, but please believe me we were very thoughtful and purposeful in the decision and the wildcard, I guess, is that I didn't think to research dog genetics.

I'm sure this has happened to many of you. You simply can't know the size a dog will grow to be when it's a puppy, no matter how confident you or the breeder think you are.

Do you have any advice on how to process these emotions, ranging from fear to regret? I need help being okay with this dog, wherever she lands. Sure, training is going well and I think she's fun and quite cute, and like I said before, we are in it for the long haul.

I live in an apartment complex and I have lived here for four years. We’ve had a dog this entire time.

I walked with my dog to the end of the block and she pooped near the end of the street. When this has happened, I normally get my dog inside first and then I throw her poop away. She has a thin coat and sometimes her paws get cold to the point where I have to carry her inside, so I try to minimize the chance of this happening.

This happened today, and I was screamed at by someone who was watching me from their balcony. I was called a See Ya Next Tuesday. I tried to tell them I’d be right back, and he said he’d report me anyway. I thought it was mainly amusing, because I can kind of understand why a level of distrust might be there. I don’t know what other dog owners do. But I literally always come back and thus I know I shouldn’t take it too personally.

831,dogs,"We have a Great Dane and a Beagle mix. We are preparing to move overseas and our dogs have to quarantine for 10 days when we do so. To prepare them for this process, we signed them up for a 3 week long board-and-train. We received updates every day and the trainers seemed great. Two weeks in, our Great Dane had diarrhea and was taken to the vet but we were told everything was okay, the vet wasn’t worried, and she was doing much better. We offered to pick her up at this point because we were worried she wasn’t doing well if she was so stressed she had diarrhea, but again they told us she was doing better and in good spirits.

When we picked her up after 3 weeks we were shocked at how skinny she was, she could barely support herself up. Our other dog was fine and had the time of his life. We asked to be sent the vet records which showed that after those first two weeks she had dropped 24.2 pounds which seems INSANE. We took her to get her weight checked, because we thought surely that can’t be, and she was still at 110 lbs. this means she lost 18% of her body weight in two weeks.

To make matters much worse, two days after we picked her up, early in the morning, she woke up and somehow had started to bloat and her stomach flipped. Luckily we got her to the vet in time and they were able to save her life. She is now at home and doing well, just super skinny and has 20+ staples in her belly. The vet said it could have been a result of dropping that much weight so quickly and all of the stress, but there is no way to know.

834,dogs,"Hey all! So I've owned a sweet little dachsund-terrier mix for almost two years now. He's never shown much aggression before, but yesterday when he was barking at the door and my stepmom (we moved in with family from living alone a couple months ago, which is a change that is probably important to note) picked him to bring him away from the door and back to cuddles, he bit her. She then held him on the ground because he was continuing to try to bite her and it ended in her very carefully (collar maneuvering so he couldn't bite her, as he was still trying to) carrying him down to his crate and putting him in, at which point she was still fearful he'd bite again because he was still snarling)- he's never done anything like this before. Any other time of aggression has been towards my dad or me giving a *correction* when he didn't listen to the ""enough"" command. He is, as many terriers and other dogs are, very verbally protective of the home, but we've been trying to teach him to relax and not growl and all the little noises at the house (especially if we are on a different floor than other people in the house)/ other people who aren't me entering rooms. He is usually happy once he sees it's family, but he growls until then despite repeat corrections of verbal commands &amp; holding his snoot. Two days ago my dad in response to my dog growling at him in my room once he still SAW my dad and knew it was a safe human was to correct with dominance, because it's worked for him with other dogs he's owned - but it didn't work with pico, it just led to 20 minutes of snarling while Pico (my dog) was pinned down. Dad would soothe him whenever he stopped growling, but my dogs response to that was to growl again, and eventually he bit my dad pretty bad. 

So these two incidents were really rough for the family, and the first one is particularly frustrating and scary because my stepmom wasn't even correcting him, just picking him up, which he's quite used to. It was surprising for all of us. We are anxious about letting him out around my stepbrother's friends now, because well, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

. I know finding an underlying cause to the aggression is a part of the struggle; does anyone have any advice on finding the cause, and/or how to train him out of this aggression? Since dominance method seemed to make things worse, I really don't think that's the route to go. Any advice would be appreciated.

836,dogs,"So I adopted my 2-year-old mutt girl 6 months ago and she's basically perfect. But anyways I'm taking her with me on a 4-day family xmas trip for the first time and I'm hoping for some related insights or experiences you have gone through so I can prepare.

The farthest I've driven with my dog is 20-30 minutes and never had issues, but this trip will be about 6 hours each way. I'll stop at least twice along the way to let her potty and stretch her legs. I have a harness that goes around her chest and has a seatbelt lock.

We'll be staying at a hotel in a dog-friendly room, then going to the main house each morning. She'll then be at the house each day with family coming and going all day, and usually all of us there each evening. I will be at the house often but not always, and I'm planning to leave my dog at the house while I'm out.

The owner of the house has two dogs who are friendly (mine is also friendly). Someone will be bringing two more dogs, I've never met them. We'll probably do walks around the neighborhood together once or twice a day.

The house is in a quiet suburb with no traffic. The two dogs that live at the house have an underground electric fence. My girl won't, and her recall is decent but not perfect. I'm not super concerned about her just taking off, but I guess it's in the back of my mind. It also may not be me letting her out to potty every time, family may as well.

I can't think of anything else but there's probably more, oh well.

841,dogs,"Today I was walking my dog, almost made it inside until a person with her dog on a leash, but not holding a leash came bolting toward us. My dog is about 80 pounds so it’s kind of hard for me to pick him up but I can do it the best I can normally I’m holding his top part of his body up while his legs are just dangling. The dog was aggressive, and I was screaming at the lady to come get her dog, which she does do eventually after she runs around me 50 times, trying to grab the leash. I told her that she should keep her dog on a leash because some dogs are not OK with other dogs and her dog was not OK with my dog which made him not OK with the dog. What is the best way I can pick my Dog up off the ground, so the dogs that are off leash around my apartment sometimes come running toward us and attacking him. He used to be completely OK with other dogs until I made a horrible mistake of going to a dog park and a doberman attacked him there which made him a little questionable of other dogs.  
But if we keep having aggressive dogs coming toward us, it’s going to completely ruin any progress we’re making  so what are the best ways to prevent a dogfight or just be prepared? I do realize I probably should have kicked the dog at that point whenever he started attacking mine, but it was in the moment, and I really hate to put a hand on any other dog. It hurts me, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do for your dog.

**Rescue.** 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

**Fun, snuggly, loves hikes, good living in a big city but would also like living in a suburban/rural (if we move out of the city). Planning on having a baby in the next few years. Would love the dog to get along with other dogs in our lives, like my parent's dog.** 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \*

**Sit. Stay. Paw. Catch.** 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

**No.** 

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

**We're happy to make sure our pup gets at least an hour a day. I'm a serious cyclist, so is she. We love our long walks in the park.** 

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**I'd prefer they're not aggressive.** 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

**Aggression, territorial, etc.** 

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

The left side neighbor is an elderly widow who lives in a large house built by her husband.  Recently, a small portion of her yard was enclosed with a standard  4' high chain link fence.  I wondered why this was done and with time saw that someone had moved into her walkout basement with a dog.  It looks to be a black GSD and the fence is there because that portion of the yard has now become that dog's world.  

On the right side, one of the homes in the subdivision put in a tall wooden plank fence.  Behind it is their two dogs' world, including one that tears at the wood when he hears me walking my dogs in my woods, barking madly.

And by ""that dog's world,"" I mean the dogs never leave their respective yards, except to go inside.  No walks, no dog parks, no training, no socialization.  They're let out, not taken out.

He unfortunately lost use of his legs, became extremely weak and stopped eating, he just wasn't himself anymore. He passed away at home via euthanasia surrounded by his family. Everything went smooth and peaceful. We will never forget our Charley. ❤❤❤❤ RIP little man ❤❤❤❤ It's going to be so empty without you.",t2_bi0zkfn8,0,My dog went to heaven today,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zouypz,True,Maigen03,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zouypz/my_dog_went_to_heaven_today/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zouypz/my_dog_went_to_heaven_today/,2472533,1671356649,0,,False,1671356666,1671356667,2022-12-18 09:44:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

865,dogs,"Today was an eye opening day for me, and not in a good way. I went about my daily activities as normal, and I arrived at work with my assistance dog. Everything was fine, I was doing my job duties, stocking shelves, my dog in a block behind me, tucked close as to not be in anyone's way. I heard a weird high pitch sound, but shrugged it off as many kids come in, so I write it off as one of them. Suddenly my dog barked. Not a loud one, not an aggressive one. But a startled one. I immediately turn to him, as after 8 years on the job, and a minimum of 3 years of training under his belt, he doesn't bark. Partly embarrassed partly concerned, I pet him to calm him and see what's wrong. My attention is caught by a man standing way too close for comfort, squating to my dog's level, and a huge grin on his face. It then clicked, this man was messing with my boy when my back was turned. As my dog is trained to ignore sounds and whatnot, I can only imagine the man grabbed him which is what startled him to bark. I try to calm myself and tell the man off, to not grab my assistance dog. The man laughs ""oh it's a service dog? Sorry, I just can't help myself when I see a dog!"" He walks off and I do the steps to refocus my partner.  

Not long after, I pass out. But this time, I wasn't able to get to the safety of a chair, or the floor in the backroom. Luckily I wasn't hurt at all, my coworkers were quick in action and helped me. Other than a migraine, I'm fine. I didn't bump my head on the way down. But what if I had? What if that was the fall that killed me? My dog was unfocused and couldn't alert me before it happened, all because a man ""couldn't help himself"". I don't blame my dog at all. If I had someone jumpscare me while I was working, I'd lose focus on what I was doing too. 

Now he is far from an aggressive dog, and he's friendly with those that respect his space. But what if he wasn't trained? What if he actually was aggressive, and he had bit that man? That man certainly didn't know, but he should have absolutely known better than to grab and startle a strange dog, especially one who's wearing a vest with many bright patches saying ""SERVICE DOG; DO NOT PET"". 

So here is my plea to the public... People, please, PLEASE, do NOT pet, grab, touch, talk too, make dog noises or otherwise try to distract a service animal. Not only is it illegal, you could potentially inadvertantly injure that handler. I know it sounds dramatic, but that's how serious this problem is, and how important these dogs' jobs are. And I know for a fact I am not the only one, because a woman was HOSPITALIZED after she suffered a seizure her dog couldn't alert her too, because he was being petted by a person despite them being being told not to do so multiple times. Her and myself are just a couple examples. 

So my ending note... When you see an assistance animal in public, no matter the size, age, breed, or even species (horses can also be service animals, they are the only other ADA recognized animal), the most polite and respectful thing you can do, is the look the other way and ignore them like they're not even there. And please, teach this to your children. Don't let them run up to our partner's while they are working, or any strange dog for that matter.

866,dogs,"**Introduction**

I live in a multi-generational house with my parents. My mother is retired, my father works. I am finishing my Master’s degree. Due to the fact that I am disabled (ASD, OCD), I am hoping to be employed part-time or work from home office. Everyone in the family likes dogs and agrees with my getting her. Caring for the dog would be my duty, although they are willing to help if needed. 

This would be my fourth dog. I have had a miniature schnauzer x staffordshire bull terrier, medium poodle and rhodesian ridgeback. I loved my RR, he was a great watch/guard dog, he was wicked smart when it was advantageous, and he learnt new things with astonishing speed. But he was not affectionate or playful, and he was quite independent. He was very food-motivated, but got bored with training relatively quickly. What he loved doing most was going on long walks and sniffing, doing his own things. I would now like a more owner-oriented breed now. 

**General breed (group)**

I want a purebred dog recognized by the FCI (Europe). I am not interested in the so-called primitive breeds, sighthounds, sled dogs. I think some of the (show line) herding, hunting, molossus, or working breeds could be a good bet, but among those, I would like to have a breed sitting between ‘good for beginners’ to ‘more knowledgeable dog owners’ on the spectrum, I am not looking for a challenge. Among others, these caught my attention:

* Herding dogs - beauceron, smooth collie, dutch shepherd - general group concern: high mental stimulation needs, shedding
* Hunting dogs - catahoula leopard dog, standard poodle, rhodesian ridgeback - high physical stimulation needs, most not good watch/guard dogs
* Molosses - american bulldog, cane corso, dogo argentino - big, not eager to please
* Working dogs - boxer (concern: hot weather tolerance, health), doberman pinscher (health), giant schnauzer (not eager to please), hovawart (shedding), white swiss shepherd (shedding)

**Mental traits**

* My ideal dog would be a best friend, companion both at home and outside, and a watch/guard dog.
* She should need either moderate or high amount of physical and mental stimulation, be intelligent enough to be easy to train, eager to please, very playful and affectionate towards me (/my family). She should be reserved towards strangers in general.
* I would want the dog to be vigilant about people near the property and alert. I would ideally also want my dog to be able to intervene if needed. One of the reasons my parents wanted to get a RR was that the breed halts intruders, but allegedly does not bite (our RR put an intruder against a fence and barked in their face until we arrived, at which point he would be recalled all fine and dandy - all that with no prior training). This would be the ideal.
* I do not mind barking if given a cause. On the other hand, I would prefer if the dog wasn’t too vocal when not necessary, or in other terms, vocal by default. 

**Physical traits**

* I am looking for a large dog weighing about 20-30 kg (44-77 lbs), but I am willing to compromise on that if the dog is right. I like the leaner breeds the most.
* Extreme cold is a rarer occurrence and easier to manage (clothing, etc.) then the heatwaves (40°C (104°F)), so if anything, the dog should tolerate hot weather. 
* I do love smooth (short hair, no undercoat) haired breeds, and I'd prefer a dog with as little shedding and drooling as possible. 
* The breed should have a reasonable lifespan (10 years+), be more or less healthy and physically sound.

**Care &amp; activities**

I am planning on taking my dog for one long walk (1x 1-2h) and for two shorter walks (2x 0,5h) in the town per day and playing with my dog on regular days, and engage in dog sports a few times a week. I live in a house with a fenced-in yard which the dog would have free access to, that offers space for more physical exercise. There are controlled socialization walks being organized near me, which I would gladly go to. I would also happily arrange for play dates with known dogs. 

I would like to train basic (and advanced) obedience, and some dog sports, esp. trick dogging. I’d like to teach her useful and helpful tasks, eg. service dog tasks or cart-pulling, so that she has something to do on regular days. I do not want to compete. The important thing is that my dog is enjoying doing a thing. I do not have stronger preferences and am willing to try and do anything non-competitively (agility, bitework, nosework… ), mondioring sounds very appealing to me - challenging, but creative and a great fun.",t2_17cns3l,0,"Searching for a best friend, companion, and watch/guard dog","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,zotmcr,True,lollkoo2,,3,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zotmcr/searching_for_a_best_friend_companion_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zotmcr/searching_for_a_best_friend_companion_and/,2472515,1671351308,0,,False,1671351319,1671351320,2022-12-18 08:15:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

868,dogs,"I'll try and keep this as short as possible, because nobody likes to read novels.

I work at a thrift store as a donation receiver. Last  week a man pulled up to donate, and when he opened his door his service dog jumped out. I saw the red service dog strap on so I tried not to get in the dogs way or stop it from doing its job. 

I greeted the man and as I walked back his dog walked straight up to me and sat on both my feet and looked up directly towards me. I stood there as still as possible before the man said ""would you look at that"". 

Knowing it was a service dog, I told the man ""I wont pet him, ill just wait."". He paused and looked at me for a good 30 seconds, then laughed and replied ""he chose to sit on you for a reason"". So, I pet the dog and he went on his way. 

Is there anything significant about this interaction that im not aware of? I cant get it out of my mind, ive been replaying it over and over in memory. Usually dogs will gravitate towards me and I always end up petting strangers dogs (who doesnt love to pet dogs), but this felt different than someone else's dog just saying hello for a pet.

875,dogs,"INFO ABOUT MY DOG:
I have a 13yo male cocker spaniel mix, neutered, ~25 to 28lbs. He's already had 7 teeth removed, including one canine (years ago). He's not the biggest fan of dry food, but can still eat it. I think his main issue with it is it's not filling him up and he always acts hungry, in a way he's never done before. He guzzles down maybe 3 bowls of water daily. His potty habits aren't as smooth as it should be as well. 

WHAT I HAVE BOUGHT SO FAR:
I feel a little all over the place with this as I bought stuff from Walmart while looking up multiple different websites (including a lot of veterinary websites).
- ground turkey
- chicken liver
- sardines in water (the ones in oil had added salt and I wasn't sure about this)
- brown rice and quinoa
- spinach, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, and sweet potatoes (all frozen)

QUESTIONS:
1. Only one source said rice was bad for dogs, the rest said it's a good source of fiber, but to keep it in moderation. What are your thoughts? Any additional resources on this would be greatly appreciated!
2. What else do I need to make this a complete diet for my doggo?
3. Do you know of any websites that really help you understand the exact details of what to feed dogs? I'm having trouble with this. 
4. I read on multiple websites to cook the meat on low heat and stop when it's barely pink anymore. This makes me nervous. Is this true? 

MORE:
I'm not feeding raw. I've heard mixed reviews on it and haven't given it a lot of reading yet, so I'd like to hold off on it. I also am not looking for suggestions to buy homemade food from websites right now. Recommendations for supplements and whatnot are appreciated though!!

876,dogs,"So My dog is a rescue and bonded hard to me and we train quite a bit because i'm a trainer. 

Well sometimes i'll hide around a corner or something when playing and jump out at him. he does zoomies, much fun is had. 

Well this time i hid behind the mostly open door to my husbands office and he looked all over the house, tap tap tap, pause, scan the area, tap tap tap. 

My side hurt from trying not to laugh, finally he examined my husbands office which he was sure i'd just left, looks around and jumps when he sees me (the same excited jump he does when he wants to play, he was stoked. 

So of course we continue this new game, i say stay, i hide in the bathroom. checked my office, looked in the livingroom. i could see through the mirror as the door had to be open with the light off to trick him. i made a noise trying not to laugh. He finds me, he spins in a circle, he's so excited as he does when he knows we are going outside. 

Next i hide under a pile of blankets. this time he knew right away because the blankets had a human sized lump, gave it a sniff and leapt on me. 

GREAT, new game. So i go to my office, hide behind the half open closet door and this time i called him. tippy tap tippy tap, comes in, scans the office carefully but didn't come in far enough to check behind the door, leaves, looks, hunts, I call him again to give him a clue and silence. what's he up to? I call him more, nothing. so i leave my spot and he's in his crate, he see's me and gives me the look of being in trouble. nothing he could have gotten into and it wasn't that long. so i call him out and he just puts his ears back looking like he's done something he knows is SUPER wrong. he rarely acts like he's in that much trouble.

we work VERY hard on ""come"" it's a life or death command, my only guess is because i actually called him and he didn't come to me (because he couldn't find me) he thought he did wrong and put himself in time out for it because that's the one command i have absolutely 0 wiggle room on, you come to your name the first time, every. single. time. If he doesn't come he goes in his crate, my primary punishment for him is he can't be out where his toy and we are, he likes his crate and likes to nap and sleep in there, but he also HATES being in it when we are home in the day. He stayed guilty i tried to bring him out and he just slunk back in. i ended up getting him out and shutting the door, which he opened without pausing because he's too smart and went back in. Eventually i got him out locked his crate and after he realized he couldn't go back in i was like buddy you're a good boy come on"" and it was at that moment he realized maybe he WASNT in trouble and followed me to my office tail wagging for a snack (very relieved) 

My dog is super smart, well trained, and a goofball.

877,dogs,"I spend everyday with my Pomeranian practically since I got her almost a year ago. If I leave her at home it’s not for long, (2-6 hours a once a week at most!) it was never a problem before as I built up to these times to establish trust. I left her (she was feed, had water, toys and free range in living room and kept the TV on for her as always) for a few more hours than normal (extremely rare!) because of car issues. 

Once I walked in, I greeted her as I always do then she ran to the couch and as I walked toward her she jumped down, ran towards my bedroom and  started screaming these blood curdling pains like I never heard before. Instantly I go to her thinking she was hurt, she wasn’t haven’t that. I immediately notice something is extremely wrong and I realize she thinks I’m in an intruder or an unknown threat. I have never seen her this way EVER (even around strangers) and I cant describe how terrified/angry? she was. I sat down to ease her and tried talking to her as I normally do but her reaction went on for 3-5 minutes then she slowly calmed down and came to me. She also peed the whole way. 

After she came to me, she done an 180 back into the loving, sweet and baby that I’ve always seen and known. This experience has me absolutely distraught and dumbfounded. I genuinely thought she didn’t recognize me or I had a smell on me that sent her into this absolute freak out. As if a child would react if she was furious, angry and hurt/under attack? 

She’s been acting normal since, no injuries and she’s eating, drinking, playing with toys, etc.

878,dogs,"I was walking my three dogs tonight through my neighborhood when two pit bull dogs came running at us from a house down the block. I did everything wrong. I panicked. I backed up with mine but there was no way to escape with them. I held onto the leashes trying to keep them close to me as the two pits circled and lunged. The man who I assume owns them was yelling and trying to grab them but I don't think they even had collars on. One of my dogs slipped her lead and ran, one of the pits chased her out of sight. With just one of his dogs left attacking us the man was able to grab it as it was ripping the coat off one of mine, so I was able to run with my remaining two after my escaped dog. As we neared my house the man's other dog ran back at us, I kicked at it and it went back to him. Luckily my dog made it home, and nobody was bleeding. 

After I finished crying and checking that everyone was ok I looked up what I should have done. I should have had pepper spray on me. I should have yelled and tried to startle the dogs off attacking. I should have dropped the leashes when they started attacking and given my dogs an opportunity to defend themselves or run. I wish I'd been armed with this knowledge before this awful night happened. Hopefully someone reads this and is better prepared than I was.

879,dogs,"I currently live in a home with a dog door to a fenced yard. Both of my dogs have lived their entire lives this way.

But, I'll be moving soon to an apartment and without access to a fenced yard from a dog door.

Both are well-behaved when I have them in a crate in my car, and I have to run an errand. They just sleep or people watch.

Once, I had visited a friend of mine, brought the crate inside for them to stay in while my friend and I went out. Dogs didn't really do anything when we left and were asleep when we returned.

But ... that time was a one-off. I'm wondering about their lives with being crated on a regular basis — when I head out to bike, ski, work a few hours outside of the home with a p/t job (I primarily work from home), date, visit friends, see a movie, etc. Really, nothing more that 4 hours or so.

I already know to keep their crate comfortable, including laying a blanket over it to create a cave-like setting (which they both really like) and making sure they have pee'd and shat.

I guess I'm worried that they may start to bark as I head out, creating an issue with the neighbors.

Maybe I'm over-thinking this, but I just want some additional tips to make this a good transition for both me and my dogs, as their lives will be like this for quite a while.

I had a friend suggest CBD as an aid, which worked well on their dogs (we have the same breed).

I want to start by saying that my dog is currently at the veterinary and will be staying the night there. This post is solely just to see if anyone else has dealt with the same thing my dog is going through. 

Last night my 1 year old golden doodle started acting a bit lethargic. She was moping around a bit and was sleeping a lot. She didn’t get into anything she wasn’t supposed to that we know of. We’re 99.9% sure of this. 

This morning, she was really hot to the touch and I noticed she wasn’t eating not even desirable foods and she wasn’t interested in her toy to play fetch. This is very abnormal since she loves fetch. 

We took her to the vet where they took her in and said her temperature was 105. They were concerned by this and wanted to run tests. They did blood work and her ALT came back high. It was at 225 and she had a low white blood cell count. They started her on IV fluids and some medication to prevent any damage to her liver. 

This afternoon they decided to keep her there. She was still lethargic and her temperature had gone down to 103 but she was still lethargic and uninterested in eating.

886,dogs,"Hello!

I’m in a bit of a pickle and hoping to get some advice. I’m currently pet and house sitting for a family I’ve watched for before. Unfortunately, due to them super under paying me, adding an extra cat without consulting me first or increasing pay, and all of the animals becoming more poorly behaved each time I come, I need go “fire them”. 

They pay me $40 a day, which I was okay with as they are a family friend and it was supposed to be super easy. But the wife complained about how tight money is even though they live in a huge house and are on their 3rd trip to Hawaii or Hawaii equivalent this year, have a big boat, RV, etc. That parts just annoying and I think rude. And the dog is NOT easy as I was led to believe. 

She’s a labradoodle and every time I come over she’s more overweight and obnoxious. I’d like to tell them this in a way that’s not over stepping. But she’s so fat now that I can barley even exercise her after my day job, but she’s still full of energy. So she’s up all night and keeps me up. She knows lots of training, but they don’t do anything with her so she’s awful, ignores you and pulls like crazy on walks. The animals all have to be separate for every feeding or the cat on a diet will steal dog and cat food, which would be fine if I was paid more, but I’m putting in 4-5 hrs of work a day and $40 a day and not sleeping so it’s not cool. 

All this to say I’m done but I’m worried about out the dogs health. I could just say “hey I can’t take care of your pets the next trip, you should look into a new regular sitter.” But I’d love to find a way to tell them that they are neglecting her mentally and physically without being super rude and accusatory.

I also already said yes to watching them at the end of Jan for a 2 week trip so I feel bad canceling on short ish notice. I’m waiting till they get back and pay me for this current trip. But my mental health just cannot take another job here.

887,dogs,"Hey reddit. I'm in desperate need of help here. My sweet girl hasn't eaten right in weeks now, and I'm afraid is on the verge of death. She's almost entirely skin and bones, and hasn't been eating right in weeks. 

Her lifelong partner dog (been together since they were both puppies) passed away in July from some health issues, and we were all heartbroken. She seemed ""down"" for a few days, but was eating normally, and seemed to be ok. However about month ago she suddenly stopped eating her dog food. Wetl tried dozens of different brands, wet food, dried, mixed. At most she would eat one or two bites then just stop.

After that we started trying to give her human food, thinking she was just getting picky as she got older. At first she would eat spoonfuls of peanut butter or chicken noodle soup, but she soon stopped eating those too. 

We took her to the vet, and they did a full exam. Blood, stool, urine, etc. They couldn't find anything wrong with her, but they agreed she was clearly malnourished. They gave us some appetite boosters, but even after getting her to eat those after practically forcing them down her throat, she still refused to eat anything. 

It's so strange. She's an outside dog, and at this point we've let her inside to eat with us, to see if she was just missing company after her ""brother"" died. Still nothing. I've given her meals I WOULD eat. Mac and cheese with bacon bits, applesauce, rotisserie chicken pieces, hummus. Nothing. She'll sniff it once or twice then refuse to eat it. 

The strangest thing of all is when we let her into the house to try and get her to eat, shell DESPERATELY start sniffing around corners/beneath cupboards as if she's starving looking for anything to eat (and to be fair, she is starving), but then when we offer her frankly delicious food.....she refuses.

The only thing I can possibly think of is that she's just lost the will to live after her brother passed away....the vet can't find anything....and she refuses to eat anything we give her. Even just spoonfuls of peanut butter, which she used to LOVE. 

She so skinny now, I doubt she's gonna make it through the week. Please help me reddit, is there anything I can do for my sweet girl? She's about 10/11 years old, so she should have a good few more years in her. She acts happy and still goes on walks and gets excited when I go out to see her, but she's clearly starving to death.

890,dogs,"He’s my sisters dog, 2 year old French bulldog, I’ve known him since he was a puppy- I’m over their house at least 2x week &amp;&amp; the dog and I are legit besties… they got a second French bull dog in April, so a little under a year old. Anyways… 

I’m dog sitting for them and 2 year old started barking intensely toward the large front window. Blinds are closed but he’s barking like he does when there’s someone outside. Although he usually stops soon after and hasn’t stopped - I’ve never seen him respond like this before esp with no obvious reason. 

When he wouldn’t stop I walked toward the window planning to open the blinds and he freaked out- like saying don’t do it. 

It’s dark outside but there’s nothing out there. Even if there was someone / thing out there initially they’d certainly be gone by now. 
His reaction has me a little spooked but I truly do not think we are in any danger. It’s really odd tho and out of character for him. 

I eventually got him to calm down by having him lay at my feet under a blanket on the couch- but I had to get up for something, and he popped out from the blanket and started barking again. 

I can’t seem to comfort him, it’s been at least 20 minutes. The younger pup is unfazed. I even took the other dog outside quickly to pee and there was nothing, the 2 year old followed us out and was fine while outside in the back. 

Come back inside and the barking continues- he will sometimes switch to a low growl but he’s very alert for seemingly no reason.

891,dogs,"Like the title states- it’s only when he’s laying in my bed that he does this. For example, it normally happens when I get up to use the restroom and I come back and he’s laying in my spot. When I try and move him, he growls and hits me with a warning nip. I feel like this behavior started about a month ago and I’m not sure if his belly hurts? (He has a bad habit of getting into things) or if he’s just picking up a bad behavior? He spends alot of time with my moms dog (same age) so maybe it’s something he got from her? He’s normally very sweet but can be reactive when anxious (he is a small breed rescue)

Today, he got kindof aggressive with my 12 year old when they were playing (12yo has high energy which we are working on that) later on-  When I touched near his hips he bit at me- but then five min later I’m rubbing that hip and he’s totally fine? 

Btw- my son didn’t hurt him- my son was singing really loud and bouncing around and my dog growled and bit at him.

His urine this morning was a tad yellow but he hadn’t drank water in a bit before I tested it. The other day when I checked it was crystal clear. He has been peeing a tad bit more than normal, but can still go 8 hours at night when he sleeps on my bed fine. He drinks a lot of water so I assumed it was due to that and dry air. No straining that I can tell. 

I know these are all questions I will be asking my vet also, but was wondering if anyone had any thoughts? I have an apt early January, but they can’t see me before then because they are so booked. His behavior otherwise is totally normal so I didn’t think it warranted an emergency visit.

I've seen folks recommend sheets and towels - but they each seem to solve one problem but not the other.

I've had a ""hammock"" car seat cover that had rubber on the bottom (so it didn't slide on the seat), but it was quilted on the top and the dog couldn't get any traction on it.

As a temporary solution, this seems like a good option to me. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097Y2BD8K IF they slide at all, at least they'll know it's somewhat contained and they're still safe.

Any better short-term suggestions/options?

11 am - play / training

12 pm -2 pm she sleeps

3 - 5 play training

5 - sleep 

7/8 - dinner, 

9 sleep

10-12 play chilling / sleeping

12am - 8 am sleeping

But while she has a lot of energy, shes always tired after play, I make sure that her zoomies are almost always spent, She's behave in her crate, she's not barking, making noise.

she listens but the issue that she's not eating as much as we want. she might eat out of our hands but not on her bowl. we tried plastic, and stainless, with wetfood, kibble with water, with her favorite treates. we still use her breeder's food of choice and hasn transitioned her to any other. we're trying to see if she will eat wellness dog food.

897,dogs,"So, I have a 10 week old puppy. We got him at almost 9 weeks… currently living with my in-laws as our house is currently being built and we will probably be here for another 6 months. 

Issue is.. my SIL adopted a 7 month old rescue from a different country. I tried to introduce my pup to him as they wanted me to so the 2 of them can socialize &amp; play together which would of been great BUT the first interaction didn’t go well. The other dog  who was on a lead at the time, was barking &amp; lunging at him, pup was terrified, ran straight upstairs. I tried again by carrying him, the same thing happened… when I took my boy into the bedroom he hid under the bed terrified. SIL &amp; BIL excuse was “oh it’s probably cos he’s on a lead” apparently he’s excellent with other dogs &amp; he probably just wanted to play.. After this incident my pup is absolutely terrified when he hears a dog barking, literally bolts from the garden straight upstairs. Walking him has become hard when he hears or sees another dog as well. He was fine before this.

Second incident was a few days ago, it was raining &amp; I quickly took him outside to do his business. They show up again with the dog, my boy tries to go back inside through the dog flap, other dog barks aggressively, they have to hold him &amp; my little guy runs &amp; trips straight into the mud. I had to hold him &amp; calm him down as he was shaking, both of us stood in the rain! They put their dog on a lead &amp; whilst still carrying my pup this dog was going crazy, pulling the lead etc. My BIL says to me “oh it’s probably cos you’re carrying him” I was so annoyed at that point I said I’m carrying my puppy cos he’s terrified &amp; walked off.

They show up frequently with him, I’m trying to potty train which is a nightmare cos I can’t allow him to go downstairs &amp; outside on his own just incase they pop by with their dog. My puppy trainer said it’s not good &amp; it’s certainly not his fault, it’s definitely going to make him fearful of other dogs (think it already has) &amp; we should speak to them about. Until he starts his puppy training classes which is on Tuesday he shouldn’t be having to go through that which is what we were told. 

Funny thing is my SIL is a veterinary nurse so I’m surprised she didn’t think about that. My MIL/FIL agreed &amp; have had a word with them about maybe letting us know when they are coming around with him so I can keep him upstairs as we don’t want any incidents. They don’t care, they showed up today, dog marked his territory all over downstairs &amp; I had to keep my pup in the room with me while he used his puppy pads which I think is wrong. It’s also causing issues with potty training. My husbands aunty has been socializing her male beagle with my SIL’S dog &amp; told us he’s already dominated him &amp; my niece has said he’s aggressive towards male dogs but her parents have made 2 excuses as to why he’s behaving that way with my pup so it’s hard to tell atm.

Not sure what to do, this isn’t my home it’s my husbands &amp; his siblings home &amp; I don’t want to say anything to them or overstep in someone else’s home. My husband however isn’t happy &amp; wants to have a word with them. What is the point if they have been told &amp; don’t care?

899,dogs,"My apologies that this is a long one. And my apologies if anyone thinks this post doesn't fit this sub - I'm just reaching out where I can for any help. Our boy has been through a lot, so there's a little bit of a story 

Here's some facts: I have a (almost) 6 year old, 95 pound blue nose pitbull. 

His symptoms started on 11/25 and were: 

-drooping entire right side of face, entire right side of face paralyzed 

- head tilt with drooping right ear
- excessive drooling 
- nausea 
- eyes ticking back and forth (not up and down)
- balance issues, dizziness 
- absolutely no appetite 
- very lethargic, not wanting to move 

Emergency vet gave us Cerenia, then appetite stimulant and had us pick up Meclizine 

He got better after a few days once we were able to get him to eat, up until yesterday 12/16 his symptoms came back, current symptoms are:

- balance is extremely off, way worse than first time, difficulty walking
- he's having trouble seeing where things are, if that makes sense, seems like hes so dizzy he almost can't see very well (it seems like this has improved a little today)
- yesterday his eyes were ticking back and forth pretty bad - but today I haven't really noticed any ticking 
- head tilt, drooping right ear - this symptom never went away since it first occurred 
- last night I felt the outside of his right ear while I was petting him and it almost felt like his ear had a fever, I felt his left ear in comparison, and his right ear was burning up from what I could feel on the outside. 
- he's lethargic, hasn't really moved much in the last 24 hours 
-Good news is he is eating a little bit, his appetite does seem there, but not his kibble, just bread and chicken nuggets (we had to resort to people food just to get him to eat when he's sick like this) 

We are giving him the Cerenia and Meclizine 

Here's a little back story on our boy: 

- Almost 2 years ago our poor baby boy's stomach flipped and he almost died, luckily we got him to emergency vet and they performed emergency surgery on him and they saved his life 

-I believe that he had a really bad ear infection that went untreated for a long time due to mild symptoms I didn't catch onto when I look back I should have seen - this ear infection was treated about I think roughly maybe 6 months ago - due to him being very sensitive about his ears, the vet put in some sort of ointment treatment that stayed in for a week to treat the infection. After the ointment soaked in it seemed like his ear was feeling better. 

-Fast forward to the beginning on November (roughly 11/5) we have moved in with my FIL because we have been in the process of selling our current home and we are now purchasing our new home (we move into new home hopefully next week). Our first night we moved into my FIL, my dog was attacked by a raccoon. This was a very very bad attack. We took him into the emergency vet right away. Vet tranquilized him to shave and clean his wounds. They put him on pain killers and antibiotics for 1 week. He healed up fine and everything seemed good.
Note on raccoon attack: The vet does not think it's correlation, but I needed to include it with the story just in case

- Fast forward to Thanksgiving day (11/25) I notice my dogs eye was drooping on the right side of his face, I was concerned, we took him to the emergency vet and right when we got there I notice his entire right side of his face was drooping, the emergency vet didn't help us and sent us on our way. That evening he vomited, we took him to a different emergency vet that had neurologist. Long story short we ended up spending the next 5 days in a row at the emergency vet. I had done some googling on his symptoms and I speculated he had vestibular disease. We had the vet do a thorough look into both of his ears, they found nothing wrong, had them do blood work and that looked great, at this point he absolutely hadn't eaten anything in nearly a week. Vet gave us apatite stimulant and he finally ate. The final vet we saw (I believe she was neurologist, we saw several doctors), but she agreed that it's vestibular disease, if I recall she didn't think it was in the brain, she said it was idiopathic and all we can do is give him time

After we finally got him to eat he started healing and within a week or so he seemed almost completely back to himself, eating regularly, playing, but his balance was still a little off. Fast forward to yesterday. I came home for my lunch and he was full blown back with the symptoms, he had vomited and his balance was way way worse than it was before, eyes ticking back and forth (not up and down) 

Today he seems slightly better, balance is still the same, really bad. It's difficult to tell because he has been sleeping all day, we understand he needs rest. But my question is, I know it's not common, but should we expect that his symptoms will come and go like this for awhile? If so, how long should we expect this coming and going of his symptoms? Any helpful thoughts or anything would be so appreciated, it's so difficult to watch him like this, I didn't sleep at all last night so any helpful thoughts, knowledge or anything would be so appreciated.

I read this [article](https://cfah.org/cbd-oil-strength/) explaining how to calculate the CBD oil strengths and the formula is basically...

    [AMOUNT OF CBD IN MG] ÷ [BOTTLE SIZE IN ML] = STRENGTH IN MG/ML

    Anything below 5 mg/mL (10%) is considered low strength.
    Anything between 15 and 30 mg/mL (15-30%) is medium strength.
    Anything between 30 and 60 (30-60%) is high strength.
    Anything else (60+%) is considered ultra-high-strength or classified as a concentrate.

That means this [500mg product](https://www.amazon.ca/2-Pack-Pet-Hemp-Dogs-Cats/dp/B07JZJN3XY/ref=sr_1_25?crid=2QNOFRHWTF33I&amp;keywords=hemp+oil+for+dogs&amp;qid=1671320604&amp;sprefix=hemp+oil%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-25)(lowest cbd strength I could find) CBD strength would be *500mg / 30ML = 17%* which would be considered medium strength.

But the [500,000mg product](https://www.amazon.ca/Petpal-Canadian-Separation-Antioxidants-Mobility/dp/B08T1KLW7Y/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2QNOFRHWTF33I&amp;keywords=hemp+oil+for+dogs&amp;qid=1671320604&amp;sprefix=hemp+oil%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-9) strength would be 8333%. What am I missing here?

The vet recommended a stronger medicine that they use when dogs are spayed/neutered (I’m totally blanking on the name rn) but I had a friend who’s Pom (my girls sister) had freaked out after taking it and was the devil. I prefer to give her Benadryl, but was curious what others used.

I read through the community rules and this looks like an appropriate place to share my ask!

This may sound unusual but I have this idea for a painting I want to do where a monk is offering a dog a communion wafer. The dog is ""sitting pretty"" on its haunches, with its paws up. 

If you have a photo of your dog sitting like this would you share it with me so I can add it to my references? I have no preference of breed or size, I'm still in the planning phase. Although a stereotyped ""aggressive"" breed would add another dimension and probably be a more popular actor for viewers, I don't want to make the impression that any specific breed needs redemption or salvation.

917,dogs,"For reference, my dog is half Dutch Shepherd and half Belgian Malinois, so she's got that working dog craziness. She's also just over a year old. 

During late spring, summer, and early fall, I did tons of exercise with my dog. Hiking trails, running, swimming for HOURS, fetch, etc. She got hours of exercise a day and was always pooped out at the end.

But now winter has come and that's all changed. We have over 2 ft of iced over snow on the ground with more on the way, it's constantly between 0 and 29 degrees outside, and even the plowed roads are covered in packed ice. All of our trails are completely inaccessible, there's no open areas for fetch or running anymore, and obviously swimming is completely off the table. Walking along the highway is too dangerous because the snow is packed up so tall and and close to the highway that I'd have to be walking in the middle of the lanes, and the roads are covered in lots of black ice so there's a huge risk of getting hit.

I've resorted to walking her down to the end of my private road and back multiple times a day (which is literally only a 1/4 mile) but since everything is covered in snow and ice, there's nothing for her to sniff/see at all. It's completely white in every direction, like a damn hospital hallway. Not even any plants in sight apart from the out of reach, partially buried trees.

For a while I tried throwing her toys/treats up on snow burns and into the deep snow for her to go find, thinking it would be like fun find game, but she kept losing toys/getting frustrated, and we had an incident recently where she got tangled in a piece of barbed wire that was hidden under snow 😬

I've been giving her TONS of mental stimulation inside (bones, frozen Kongs, slow feeders, new toys, nose games, boxes with treats inside to shred, etc) but without physical exercise, she's going stir crazy in my small one story house and absolutely driving me batshit. There's been so many sleepless nights where she's just constantly stirring around and keeping us both up.

Someone suggested one of those self propelled dog treadmills to me, and I was super excited about the idea, but unfortunately they're massively expensive and completely unaffordable to me (I just had a little truck accident recently where I slid on ice and went into a ditch, so I already have to pay to redo the front underside of my truck ☹️ the PNW sucks sometimes.)

923,dogs,"So I got up this morning and my little Chihuahua had a small piece hand sized of green fluff. I'm not sure if it's stuffing as she does destroy toys, but stuffing is normally white. 
Or insulation? Our house has white insulation so idk where it came from. It's been wet all night so I don't think it came from outside. 
Kind of freaking out. May be nothing but if it's insulation is it harmful/worth a vet trip? 
I don't think she ate any and gave her some charcoal mixed with dog food just in case
If it is insulation that could mean someone tried to harm her which is also very concerning 😟

924,dogs,"
**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I had a German Shepherd when I was a kid and me and my wife currently have a Yorkshire Terrier.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A smart gentle giant. I want a friend that would spend time with me, either at home or when traveling. A dog that doesn’t shed would be ideal and I don’t really care about barking. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* In no particular order: Cane Corso, German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois, Australian Shepherd, Barbet, Golden Retriever.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Honestly I just want the dog to be polite, no detailed tricks needed. So sit, stay, come, down, no/drop it, heel, etc.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, it's just gonna be a companion 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Training: 1 hour or less once it's an adult, maybe more like 2 hours on weekends. When it's young I would want to go to training classes with the dog and will put more time in to get started 

* Playing/interacting: I want the dog to spend as much time as possible with me and my wife.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* My wife and I are very active people. We go camping and hiking almost every weekend.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing and weekly groomer. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* I like large dogs 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* As little shedding and slobber as possible. I don’t really care about barking

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Somewhat important. I don't plan on regularly doing this, but want them to have good recall if they accidentally get off leash 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I want one that doesn't get anxious when I'm away, but is open to cuddles. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A mix? If I'm in a multi hour meeting I don't want the dog to be anxious and sad. However, I do want one that's open to playing, cuddling, etc when im off work.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Maybe one or two barks to alert if someone is breaking in, but otherwise sweet and polite to visitors 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My wife and my grandmother are always home so the dog will almost never be alone. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Me and my wife are both dog lovers. My grandma also likes dogs. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, a Yorkshire Terrier 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No but I still want it to be nice to children 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a farm

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in Florida, I think only pit bulls are banned here.  

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Hot summers and warm winters 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

936,dogs,"During the start of March 2020, my fiance and I were left with so little. My fiance lost his business and was just down. When the lockdown begun, we were both unemployed and had nothing but a tiny house in a... sketchy area. 

Beside us was a neighbor, who's dog started to get neglected, and tied the dog in front of our house. The dog would be there, without shelter from the rain. Whenever we pass by, his scrap food is made of... Spaghetti leftovers, with a vinegar-based Asian soup mixed in. It would be left uneaten for days. At one point I saw a whole chili in his food scraps, and plastics of ketchup. They left him in the rain and he would startuu barking incessantly. We usually untie him from his chain, let him into our house and feed him whatever scraps we had that I knew were safe for dogs (like squash mixed with hotdog bits). We really dint have much. He'd stay with us overnight, then we'd speak to our neighbors about them forgetting the dog outside. They'd take him back in, but we'll see him back tied to the front of our house a few hours later. 

I begged my fiance to ask for the dog, like we can take over for his care. He comforted me, but disagreed due to out current financial strain. I understood, but still cried like a baby the whole night.

2 days later, we found out they stopped feeding him. I think something snapped in my fiance when he found out (who is a cat person tbh) and just went to the neighbor, and asked for the dog. They agreed, so since then we took him in. He had a lot of fleas, some malnutrition and dehydration, so we took him to vet visits to groom him and get the proper treatment he needs and update his vaccinations. We barely ate anything that week, it was tough. 

A few days later, a call came in from a friend. He is quitting his current company, and was recommending me as replacement to his boss. I took the chance, went to the interview, got offered the job... The pay was pretty decent, more than what I needed. It was a middle management role, and pretty secure. 

Since that job, I've switched companies a year later, got better pay and the work was remote (so I get to spend a whole day with the doggos now) . Got a promotion within 8 months. 

Suffice to say, that dog chained and neglected in front of our house years ago, is spoiled rotten now. He sleeps with us on the bed, especially when it rains (he is always super anxious when it rains). He gets a mix of kibbles, canned wet food and some cooked meat toppings (that he would sometimes ignore now, like I swear to God this dog is... Spoiled.) 

We have 2 additional rescued dogs now (and 2 cats too). Our life has been so filled with love from these munchkins, and even though they are rescues... I swear, they saved me. I was depressed (I have bipolar) and didn't have the will to try my luck in jobs back then, until these little angels came into my life.

939,dogs,"First of all, my dog is my whole world. It’s been mostly just me and her for the last 5 years since I got her and we’re inseparable. We do a 2-3 mile hike everyday together at the same location, and today when we went she was on leash and attacked by another dog. The other dog was smaller than her (about 30lbs and my dog is 75lbs) and was also on a leash. 

The owners said their dog was friendly when I asked, so we were going to let them sniff one another when the dog immediately growled at my dog and snapped at her neck. The owners were laughing it off and trying to get their dog away but it probably did this 2-3 more times before my dog growled back and we were finally able to break them apart. 

It happened so fast - my dog never cried and is okay as far as I can tell with no bite marks to the skin. Since they were both on leashes, I was at a loss for what to do. The other owners apologized but also were laughing it off and not seeming like it was a big deal. Now that I’m home and thinking about it, I wish I reacted and defended my dog more. I tried to separate them and pull her away as much as I could, but maybe I should have kicked the dog or gotten in the middle immediately to protect my dog? I’m just feeling awful I didn’t do much and therefore she had to defend herself after getting attacked 4 times.

941,dogs,"I adopted my mixed breed (mostly boxer) female dog from the shelter a little over two years ago. She’s 5 to 7 now as they told me she was 3 to 5 when I adopted her.

I love her and she has some very endearing qualities. She is a lovable little goofball, extremely sweet and loyal, very perceptive, very protective and would just cuddle with me all day if she could.

But she was never leash trained or taught her manners. They told me she was rescued from an unsafe condition by a special task force, has been confined to a cage 24/7, and it appeared based on the size of her mammary glands that she had been bred excessively so my theory is she was being used for puppies.

She’s extremely clingy and follows me everywhere but also just does not obey when it doesn’t suit her. She knows what sit and stay mean, but if I have her off the leash (eg my back yard) and she sees something that catches her interest, she will not obey. She barks at any and everything around the perimeter of my house, which is good in case of a burglar or something, but when she sees a stray cat out back and chases it and barks at it, or barks at a neighbor, and I tell her to come and she ignores me, I don’t know how to handle that situation.

On walks she just pulls and pulls on the leash no matter what, wants to sniff everything all over the grass. I have tried east walk harness and it didn’t help. Any harness with a loop on the front makes her a sled dog. Just pulling nonstop. I have walked her virtually every single day the past 2+ years, usually on the same route, but every day it’s a physically draining ordeal where she acts as though we’ve never been on a walk before, acts like she’s seeing everything for the first time, and as if it’s a foreign concept to her. I usually try to be patient but there are definitely days I don’t even want to walk her because it’s so draining.

I’ve tried three trainers, one of whom was the only accredited trainer in my area when I searched the CCPDT database. She claimed to have three decades of experience with reactive dogs but even she remarked upon how physically draining it was to try to walk my dog, and her method of trying to use treats to draw her attention did not seem to work. My dog is obsessed with food but will literally just spit it out on walks because she is so hyper focused and over stimulated on our surroundings. The trainer seemed to realize her techniques weren’t working and didn’t even charge me for our final session. I tried a couple others and had no real luck with them either.

Long story short, are some dogs just untrainable? Due to her age and her upbringing without any kind of guidance, is she simply too old and too conditioned already to accept any reconditioning or training? Is there anything else I can do or try? Trainers say not to use flexi leashes but I’m honestly considering it just to reduce the amount of pulling I deal with every day.",t2_12dseu,0,Is it possible to leash train an older dog?

945,dogs,"Okay, well…I continue to search for a breed that would be suitable for me and my lifestyle. I don’t exactly feel like filling out the template again though, so I apologize for that.

Anyway, at this point I am mostly interested in small to medium sized dogs (I’m 5’1 and underweight so I don’t think I could handle a bigger dog despite my love for them).

Moving on, I currently only do moderate exercise (when I do exercise), I like to walk around my property with my chocolate lab (who is really more of a family dog). I also sometimes go on walks up a dirt road by my house with my lab who is both well behaved off leash and small for the breed.

So breeds I am interested in are as follows: the Alaskan Klee Kai, Japanese Spitz, Shiba Inu and similar breeds (I know Shibas are highly difficult to train as well as predisposed to resource guarding and antisocial behaviors), possibly Keeshonds, MAS, I love Border Collies (their high energy could make them unsuitable for my lifestyle though), and perhaps Carolina Dogs. 

I know they can be large, but I’m also interested in White Swiss Shepherds (AND I’m a fan of German Shepherds but think they may be too much and too big for me so I don’t know what to make of that). I like how White Swiss Shepherds are (generally) more mellow and less aggressive than GSDs. Oh, I might add that there is a real possibility that I may be getting a service dog (although I can’t be sure at this point).

Is there anything else I should include in this post? Qualities I would like to see in a dog are things such as biddability, affectionate, if possible cuddly, ideally not overly standoffish when it comes to strangers, even tempered, loyal, etcetera. 

Another thing is that I am a skier and I think I have an interest in potentially learning how to do skijoring. Oh, and I love Siberian Huskies but know for a fact that, at least at this point in my life, they would be way too much for me.

I’m on a waitlist for a puppy that is supposed to be born at the end of January, and I’m so excited. 

The breeder that I’m on the list for let me know that that her dog was in heat in the beginning/middle of November, but I haven’t heard anything since. I’ve been pretty anxious that there isn’t a pregnancy. It’s been such a long wait already, and waiting another year seems like it would be horrible.  

Is there a pretty good chance that the mating was successful? Would they have let me know by now if there were to signs of pregnancy?

947,dogs,"Hi everyone-


I recently rescued a pit mix and have been struggling to adequately exercise and tire her out. She's 1 year old and untrained. She needs a lot of walking training as she gets super ADHD and distracted by everything she sees. I live in a dense city and there's always a lot of action - a lot of people, dogs, cars, noises, etc. It's extremely hard to walk her as she pulls and loses focus by all the distractions. As a result I cannot take her for long fulfilling walks as it's too much for her and I cannot allow her to be all over the place when she walks. I train her how to walk inside (no distractions) and then we go out for a short walk down the block and back. We don't move too fast or go very far as I need to constantly be correcting and training her as we go. Therefore walks don't physically tire her out enough.


Although I do play with her alot indoors (training, tug of war, small games of fetch, etc) it still isn't getting her the physical exercise she needs.


I know that one exercise I do (as a fitness junkie) is throw on a weighted vest and ankle weights and go for walks around the city. After 15 minutes of walking I can feel it and it wears me out. I know that there is a concept of weighted vests for dogs - I heard XDog makes a reputable weighted vest. Does anyone have any insight on weighted vests or harnesses? I've read as long as you don't do too much weight and don't leave it on for too long it can be a safe way to wear out a dog. However I can also see how it could potentially damage a dogs bones and joints and cause issues, especially if the vest or harness doesn't fit right. 


If a weighted vest isn't recommended, does anyone have any good ways of exercising a dog without having a place she can run freely or without having to go for long walks? I read for bully pitbulls a lot of people train them by having them jump up and hang from a rope. Not sure if this is healthy or hard on a dogs body, but maybe I can try that with my dog? Generally when we play tug I don't try and make her hang. I assume that's hard on her and not healthy, but it is what people do to exercise pitbulls.


Any suggestions would be great! I've Googled it and tried all the games and activities to wear out a dog but most either don't keep her attention or do little more than provide some entertainment. Which is great, but she really needs physical stimulation!

950,dogs,"I don't know what subreddit I should post this in but since it's about a dog I figured I could vent/ask here.

My roommate chose to get a high energy dog (aussie) when she is not high energy herself. As a result, the dog is 3yrs old, not neutered, and has been on maybe 6 walks his entire life. She really lucked out with him because he's content to be in his kennel 24/7, or forgotten in the backyard. He was also a dream to train.

Lately though he's been peeing outside his kennel in frustration. I personally would like to see her rehome the dog (she's mentioned several times she doesn't like him and gets annoyed when she has to provide food for him and proudly proclaims she's not a dog person). She threatens to often but never follows through.

I feel bad for the dog. I resolved to not involve myself with her antics because she has no impulse control, so I didn't want to have anything to do with her animals. Now, though, after he peed outside his kennel again, I am struck with the urge to walk him any time she isn't home. It's not often that she's not home so it wouldn't be a constant thing.

Should I ask her if she'd like me to walk her dog? Or should I tell her he peed again and hope she rehomes him?

He's a 12yo German Shepherd (aprox 100lbs) with hip displacia and little remaining hearing.  He's a rescue, when we got him they said he was 5yo, but I'm thinking more like 7.  The past week he's been sticking mostly to his bed and keeping to himself and he is looking weak.  He gets terrible car sick, over the years we tried everything, nothing helped.  He even reacts when he gets a note of the anti nausea drugs, drooling, frothing and heaving etc.  I'm not into the idea of making him travel in the car when the time comes.  Not to mention if I even could get him into the car due to his size.  It seems cruel to make him feel sick just before passing. We use a mobile vet which could perform the procedure here at the house. 

Considering possible scenarios, the idea of sequestering the two dogs to emerge with the elder never to be seen again feels wrong.  But what the two will understand and take away from the process is so debatable. I'm on the fence.  I understand and expect both us humans and the remaining two dogs will experience grief.  I'm more concerned witnessing the procedure could be more than they can process .

974,dogs,"\[Help\] About a 4 moths ago, my dog has been growing a sort of fleshy lump on his paw. I believe its from an untreated infection that may have happened to him on one of his walks but after treating it multiple times yet it refuses to leave, it doesn't appear to hurt him when pressure is applied and apparently doesn't bother him either considering he still runs and hops around with his paw striking the ground, so I haven't taken him to the vet partly because I'm short on money. I just need some help identifying what it is and how to treat it or if it's worth taking him to the vet and have them treat it

980,dogs,"# Introduction

**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* Yes

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

* Rescue dogs are preferred. But happy to go to a reputable breeder if there's something harder to come by that would be the """"perfect"""" choice.

**Describe your ideal dog.**

* Medium energy
* Big and chunky enough to hug and cuddle, just nothing too small.
* Primarily outdoorsy
* 30-60min walks daily is currently what we're able to provide (bums me out since I'd love a Husky but wouldn't be able to take it for the walks it deserves!)
* Not too much shedding, and able to live in quite warm climates (in New Zealand, Auckland so also quite humid)
* Comfortable in a 50ft x 40ft backyard (doghouse included of course)
* Breed not genetically prone to too much disease
* Not too aggressive towards other people or dogs
* Not too high maintenance / costly maintenance (We're comfortable enough to deal with most things that may arise so it's not a matter of not being able to provide the care )

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* Rottweiler Mix - Less health concerns than purebred rottweiler
* Staffie x Mastiff - Big and cuddly
* Staffie x Pointer - Big and cuddly

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

* Be comfortable walking with a leash, reduce barking as much as possible when left alone, not be aggressive, poop outdoors

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* No.

# Care Commitments

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* Personal training, perhaps 2-5 hours per week on average. Happy to put it through puppy school.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

* 30-60 minute walks on average, likely closer to 30-40 minutes. Likely some extra exercise together in the yard too.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* Once a week. Open to trimming hair, and doing other grooming as a last resort, but also happy to take it to a professional once a week.

# Personal Preferences

**What size dog are you looking for?**

* Big boi.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* Preferably very little barking, little to medium slobber, little to medium shedding.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Not a deal breaker but would be preferable.

# Dog Personality and Behavior

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* Bit of both, something that loves attention and is cuddly, but can do well on its own for a few hours a day.

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

* Again, a bit of both but preferably one that does its own thing most of the time.

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* A short period of barking, then back to being more calm and collected. With guests, happy for it to be a bit more energetic for a slightly longer period.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* Not as much - likely little to no engagement with other dogs physically but realistically also don't want to have something that is too aggressive.

**Are there any other behaviours you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

* Overly barking, especially at night or early in the morning.

# Lifestyle

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?**

* At most 3-4 hours a day between 8am-7pm, outside of these hours likely it's on its own outside.

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* 3 person household, one will likely not be very involved, but other 2 are excited and eager. Both will be taking the dog for regular walks, taking it to vet when needed, puppy school, etc. Both looking for something big cuddly and calm.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

* No other pets, but often a cat may sneak into our yard

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* No

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* Yes, renting. No restrictions.

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* Auckland, New Zealand - Not too familiar but have researched recently and we have the 'Dangerous Dogs Act' which prohibits the importation, breeding, sale, and exchange of the following breeds: (but does not ban all types of breeds). The Act allows the local council to declare any other breed of dog to be a ""menacing dog"" if it has displayed aggressive behaviour. In this case, the same requirements apply to the banned breeds:

1. American Pit Bull Terrier
2. Brazilian Fila
3. Dogo Argentino
4. Japanese Tosa
5. Perro de Presa Canario

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Summer:  22 to 24 degrees Celsius (71 – 75 degrees Fahrenheit)  
* Winer: 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit)  

# Additional Information and Questions

**Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Family of 3, youngest is 25.

Member 1 - Works 9am-5pm 6 days a week

Member 2 - Works 2am-3pm 6 days a week

Member 3 - Works 8pm - 5pm 3 days a week, works from home with regular breaks.

Usually, at least one person will go for a walk every day or every 2 days for about 30-60 minutes.

Live in a surrounded neighbourhood, so hopefully can reduce any unnecessary barking as much as possible.

Middle-class family, so preferably something not 'too' high maintenance or prone to genetic disease, cancer, etc.

984,dogs,"Hello!
I'm asking for advice in the matter of introducing a person that is not a big fan of dogs to a protective individual.
The story: I'm taking my bf with me to meet my family. At my aunt's place there's a mixed Toller Retriver. She barks a lot because they needed her to be more protective of the house (bad neighborhood). She's a sweet heart, I honestly love that doggo, but until she will be quiet and calm down with a stranger inside, I'm afraid my bf is gonna faint lol and I want all of us to spend nice time together.
I was thinking of asking my cousin to introducing them on a walk before stepping into the house and him just ignoring the dog until he feels comfortable and calm. I'll be encouring both of them to make it easy. What do you guys think? any tips?

985,dogs,"I'll try to make this short and sweet. My husband and I are splitting up. There have already been some changes as my husband has been transitioning (hormonally) and my husband has brought a new boyfriend home (I'm moving soon).

My dog has a lot of anxiety about any changes. He's been a little on edge for weeks reverting back to his early street dog mentality ways of stealing napkins and dirty dishes. He got very anxious when we moved years ago. He didn't do well with my husband's bf visit.

Now I'm moving and I've been slowly introducing him to the place. I'm trying to figure out what's best for him as we plan on sharing custody of the dog (one week on, one week off) with each other. 

I'm moving then in a few days time, I'll be going on vacation while he stays with my husband. The problem I'm having is what can we do to make sure he has a good transition for the next month as I will be out of town until the end of the month and my husband, there will be a rotating door of my inlaws (which he knows) then afterwards my husband's bf will stay for a month. My husband wants the dog to bond with bf but also wants what's best for our dog. I really don't care if the dog bonds with the bf but I do want him to be ok?

992,dogs,"Hey, so I have a question regarding dog ownership based on my current situation, which I'll explain, and I appreciate any input.

I've always wanted a dog since I was a kid, but there's always been someone allergic in the house, or the place I was renting didn't allow them. But now, I've moved in with my brother, a cat owner, for the next several months while I wait for some things to go through before I can finally buy a home of my very own. It's from there my concerns have cropped up.

So my brother's cat is an affectionate little guy, never mean, but there's a lot of aspects of his behavior that I'm just tolerating, that my brother has grown to like or gotten used to. I'm not sure if these are just cat things, or if I get a dog, I'll find I'll just be tolerating them in the same way I'm tolerating my brother's cat. Googling for answers on this hasn't helped, so if someone has experience with both animals, I'd be very grateful for your opinion. Here are some of the behaviors I'm talking about.

The biggest one is probably the unpredictability of the cat. Like if I bring home some takeout, I'll be at the table, and he'll come by. I'm assuming he's interested in whatever I'm eating, so I position myself to let him know the food isn't his, which seems to work, until out of nowhere, he leaps up and swipes at the paper receipt, now vigorously playing with it and zooming around, until he goes to the couch to sit down. I look back, and he's disappeared. I look down, and see him next to me, apparently interested in what I'm eating again. He's like a little ghost, and I can't predict what he wants to do. He just gets in my business, vanishes, and shows up out of nowhere again, and it kind of stresses me out, even though he's harmless and made of 95% snuggles. Sometimes he'll try to get in my room or follow me outside the house, and I have to physically block or move him because he doesn't understand my prompts, and other times he'll be watching from afar and not care. It's almost like it would be easier if he were always trying to get into my room or always trying to get out the front door with me. It's like I can't read what he wants, and he can't read what I want, not that we dislike each other.

Are dogs unpredictable in this way too, and if they are, can it be trained out of them? My experiences visiting homes with dogs tell me no, but I've never spent more than a couple days around one at once. I don't want to put myself or my animal in a position where we are both anything but very comfortable being around one another. Any advice is very much appreciated.",t2_qtiqk,0,Second thoughts on dog ownership due to experience with cat?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6.0,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6.0,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zo0maq,True,Desertscape,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zo0maq/second_thoughts_on_dog_ownership_due_to/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zo0maq/second_thoughts_on_dog_ownership_due_to/,2472171,1671260817,0,,False,1671260831,1671260832,2022-12-17 07:06:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

994,dogs,"I've been dog sitting for the past week, and my experiences with this dog have led me to doing some research—I have discovered the term ""velcro dog""!—but I can't quite figure out how to handle this dog. It seems to want to attach itself to me at all times. I can't even go to the bathroom without it trying to follow me in. It was maybe cute for the first day, but it quickly got obnoxious. It follows me from room to room. It follows me around the kitchen as I cook (I've accidentally stepped on it a few times when I turn around quickly—it's that close to me). It refuses the bed of pillows I make for it in the living room, instead opting to sleep on the cold hardwood floor outside my bedroom door. It's either not very smart, or just the most exceptionally codependent creature I've ever met. 

So, my question is, how do you set boundaries with a dog like this? How do I get it to give me some space? I'm not trying to be neglectful or anything. I'm taking it on two walks a day, and feeding it throughout the day. Sometimes I even talk to it—though, I worry that by talking to it I'm encouraging its codependency.

997,dogs,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years. For the last 11 years he has shared custody of our 2 dogs with his ex partner (never married). They both put money in on 1 dog and my husband paid for the other fully. There have been issues along the way but for most part it has been an amicable share. 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. 

2 days ago they had a disagreement over text, which escalated into the ex partner stating he is keeping the dogs. My husband panicked, as we have a written agreement saying we would share from a previous clash. My husband called the police and they can't help because it's a civil issue but did call the ex to try to deescalate him and return to our regular schedule. Well this set the ex off more, a string of expletives over text eventually saying we will never see them again.

He then relented and said if we sign a new agreement saying he is the owner we could go back to the regular schedule. We say fine, we get the contract and it says nothing of the sort, it states he is the owner and we only get visitation rights up to 8 hours at a time. So we asked for clarification and he admitted to saying the contract changed, basically trying to trick us. We didn't sign it of course.

We are completely heartbroken. 

We have always paid our share for vet bills, grooming, etc. We take them for daily walks and keep them very happy and healthy. Whenever we get them back from the ex the last year there is always an issue. Stomach problems, ear infection, UTIs, etc. It can be old age but we are concerned they are not getting the same quality life with the ex but we didn't want to be cruel and take them fully away; which was mistake. 

We have a timeline documented with multiple issues. We live in Utah and from my research we are a state where there is no custody but just property laws for pets. I know the ex loves them and will take care of them but I can't let this go, he is being so cruel and heartless. I want our dogs back, but I don't know how to go about doing that.

I tried looking for a lawyer online but a pet lawyer is not easy to find. Any suggestions or help I can get will be much appreciated.
