1,dogs,"M is an spayed female who I adopted eight years ago this month. I actually adopted her five days before Christmas in 2014. She's a fantastic dog and I love her but the one thing I've noticed with her is that occasionally whenever there's only one or two of us in the house, M will pace about the first floor and whine/whimper when she realizes people have left. I live with four other people and whenever all three or four of us are home (one person sleeps elsewhere at night but is here during the day) she's perfectly fine. but occasionally I'll be alone in the house with her or I'll be alone in the house with her and one of my other roommates here and she will pace and whimper/whine and wait at the door. And we do try to verbally redirect her and reassure her we are here and she isn't alone and ""_____ will be right back"". She's never destructive though and doesn't have accidents in the house.

2,dogs," I am losing my bloody mind. 

Going to start this off by saying my dog is the love of my life. Nothing and nobody has ever meant as much to me as this little girl has meant to me. She is my best friend, my family, my whole heart.

She is 15, a pug mix that I was fortunate enough to come by at a shelter. She had a crap beginning stuck in a cage for the vast majority of her life (9years) . She was neglected and abused, not socialized, hates other animals and is distrustful of people. We were instant friends however. To this day I can't figure it out. I took her home the morning after I saw her, and it was, genuinely, like she had always been with me. There was no ""Adjustment period"" she just moved right on in and forgot her old life. Ready to take advantage of her new situation. Instantly I was in love.

That was 5 1/2 years ago. Too short a time. She is 15 now and deteriorating rapidly. Clearly dementia or alzheimer's plaguing her. She paces around all night, is losing control of her bowels, has panic attacks where she starts hyperventilating, she has a partially collapsed trachea, needs to be carried up and down the stairs, is starting to have problems just walking, and is going blind. It's SO much. Watching this happen is ripping my heart to freaking pieces. There are periods where she's just her goofy, Saucy and obnoxious little self. Full of spunky energy, and this is why I haven't... Ended this. 

I feel like a monster. I lose my cool with it all sometimes. It just gets to be too much.  I don't yell or smack her, or even really get mad. Nothing that is happening is her fault, and I never lose sight of that, but the exhaustion takes over and I get really numb. I once in a while can't handle the constant pacing, digging at nothing, hyperventilating and I'll slap earphones on and lie on the couch out of reach. I feel awful, but I'm breaking.

I sleep on a garbage little twin mattress on the floor. She can't get in or out of my proper bed anymore and has severe separation anxiety, so for the last 2 years this has been the situation. I don't mind except my back is killing me from the mattress and having to carry her all the time. 

I know this will end, and probably very soon. This is where I feel the worst. There's a small part of me that finds that relieving. Bigger part of me has no idea how I will even live without her, but that small bit... It's there and I will never forgive myself for it. 

 I hate this so much. My heart is so broken and I don't exactly have any support. People keep saying ""Just enjoy the time you have left"" I understand this comes from a good place, but ffs... Without becoming insulting I can't begin to explain how mad that makes me.  Thanks, never thought to try to  enjoy my best friend who is slowly dying in front of me. Good call.

4,dogs,"A little backstory, my sisters in laws took in a german shepherd puppy. After they realized how much work a puppy was, they decided they couldn't meet his needs and pushed him onto my sisters family. My sisters kids begged to keep the puppy, and her husband initially wanted him, so she kept him. 

1 year later, he isn't trained. He still occasionally pees on the floor. He doesn't like children. He chases their cat. He doesn't do all that well with their other dog. Overall, I blame this on lack of stimulation/training/exercise. 

We found a german shepherd rescue that we thought would be a great fit, and they rejected him, as he is ""not friendly."" She was then rejected by another shelter. It's really frustrating and disheartening. Other shelters seem to have long wait lists. We live in eastern Pennsylvania. My sister is desperate to find a suitable place for this dog.

5,dogs,"Hi r/dogs this is my first post here

My dog is a female labradoodle, 4 years old and ever since she was 1 she would sleep in my room with me. She never had any problem with it and it was always difficult to remove her from my bed in the morning.

Now it is the complete opposite. I have to force her to go into my room and once shes in there and im in bed, she lays by the foot of my door and waits for me to open it. Eventually she comes and lays in bed with me but if i make any movement showing that im about to get up, she leaps off my bed and is back sitting by the door.

I suspect it is because she has been sleeping with my parents once i left for college and has gotten more comfortable in their room. There was also this one night where my window made a loud buzzing noise out of nowhere. It frightened her and I believe she is scared of my room because of that incident

Could anyone tell me if im on the right track? Is it even worth trying to get my dog to sleep in my room anymore?

8,dogs,"My sister has two dogs (3.5yo female, 4yo male). Ever since she got them, I’ve allowed her to bring them over (maybe once every 4-6weeks). It’s always a little chaotic since they’re high energy; they jump on people when they enter, weave between legs, and pace around. Despite this, they’re pretty good dogs.

Two years ago I got a dog of my own (2yo female). Normally my dog is playful and eager to socialize with others. If we’re outside she tries to play with my sister’s dogs but they’re disinterested. When we go inside, my dog starts off OK but as hours go by, her frustration increases and she begins lashing out. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel comfortable having them loose in the house so I set up a baby gate to divide the home. Despite this precaution, my sister often ‘forgets’ to make sure the dogs are separated so there’s been a few incidences where my dog has snapped at hers. The last two visits my sister has said my dog should be muzzled whenever she brings her dogs over since if something happens, I’ll have to pay the vet bill. 

On the one hand, I feel bad to say my sister can’t bring her dogs over since I’ve always let them come. However, having her dogs over is incredibly stressful and the burden of supervision falls on me since my dog is the “problem”. My dog can’t wear a muzzle for an entire 2-day visit, and I don’t trust my sister‘s supervision if I step out for an hour. Would it be a dick move to say no more dogs? I’m really fed up being the “supervisor” and my dog made out to be the “bitch”. 

I should mention that other friends have brought their dogs over and my dog is completely different with them (calm, playful, sleeps).

11,dogs,"It took me awhile to peace together what was happening but I eventually figured out I think my dog gets hunger pukes. They're not consistent, God he maybe has an incident once a month if even that, definitely hasn't happened 12 times this year but definitely happened minimum 5 times. Some background first:

Dog is male, neutered, 4yrs old, Jack Russell/Papillion mix
He's on prescription gi food due to an incident earlier this year he had a bad bout of pancreatitis and was hospitalized for 3 days. He made a full recovery but when I tried to transition him back to normal food he had a small reoccurance so we agreed with our vet to just keep him on the prescription food
His feeding schedule isn't super consistent I try to keep it consistent at least in the evening it's always within the same hour but the morning it's less consistent as it's based on whoever gets up first. I can't figure our the best times to feed him. In the evening I'd prefer to feed him at 7 to 8pm but then when should his morning meal be?

The hunger pukes, like I said not often but when they do happen it's always in the evening never the morning. I think it happens on days where he's fed a bit earlier than usual and I don't notice cause I wasn't the first one up. But suddenly in the evening around an hour before his scheduled feeding time he'll start doing the dreaded heaving. Always makes me freak out especially since it's always on carpet 😂 he'll puke up a little yellow bile and then walk a few feet and do it again but the second time it's usually barely any bile. Occasionally he might have a third dry heave but it doesn't produce reallt anything. Right after I'll rush to feed him since I know the cause, I break out his wet food(he has both prescription dry and wet I just alternate) and add a little bit of water to it since I know he just lost fluids and needs them refreshed. He'll eat with no problem, happily wagging his tail and then promptly boogy around the house like nothing happened. Chase the cat a bit, ask to go outside and pee etv. So I'm not concerned about that part but I would like to find a way to stop these from happening as I imagine it's not fun for him to be sick

I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to stop them and what feeding schedule I should follow? I've never had a dog that did this, my other dog doesn't care when shes fed she's got no sense of schedule whatsoever 😂 so I'm not used to having a strict schedule.

I’ve been feeding her through the gate lately. I got fed up and decided to call the cops, they came over and I gave them information on the people who used to live there. They told me they’re going to arrest or cite them for abandoning and not providing adequate shelter/food/water. GREAT! I’m here for it and agree. They also asked me if I could care for the dog since it’s been freezing here and I assumed my doga would be okay with it. So I said yes (what I should’ve done was asked them to let my dogs see her  before making a decision incase they didn’t get along) I’m stupid. But yeah long story short I’m sadly going to have to take her to the animal shelter and surrender her. I stayed outside for hours with the dogs for two days and they just don’t get along. 

I don’t even know if my donation of 500 will even be enough to keep her there alive or not. I just feel horrible because I really wanted to keep her and give her a good home considering she was abandoned and left to die, but with the way my dogs are reacting it’s not possible.

19,dogs,"We adopted a sweet little 2 or 3 year old terrier mix on Sunday morning. Underweight, but he used to be a stray, so it’s understandable. Energetic, silly, adorable.  Neutered about three days earlier, still on a painkiller.

He lost energy early Sunday evening. Monday morning I gave him his painkiller and he perked up. He would occasionally cough, but otherwise seemed okay. He happily ate some cooked ground beef, but was losing interest in food. Started shaking a bit occasionally. 

Tuesday he’s worse and coughing more, occasionally shaking. Happier when he’s on his painkiller, but obviously sick. Would only eat some scrambled eggs; no interest in food other than that one midday meal. I made a vet appointment for the next day. 

Wednesday he’s hurting and shaking. I take him to the vet. No painkiller, so they can see his symptoms. He’s getting worse by the hour. He went from 11.5 pounds last Tuesday to 10.8 pounds. (I think he should be closer to 15 pounds.) After tests and x-rays, he’s diagnosed with pneumonia Wednesday evening. The vet says he’ll be there a few days, but seems fairly confident that he’ll bounce back.

Thursday he’s stable.

Today they said they were hoping he’d start eating again by now, but he’s not. They’re going to keep trying through the weekend.

I’m scared we’re going to lose him. He’s so young and he just got his forever home — he should have years ahead of him to enjoy it. 

Is not eating after the second day of pneumonia treatment automatically a horrible sign? Or is there any hope, given that he hasn’t gotten worse?

34,dogs,"Good evening, folks! I’m currently in the Navy, living with my wife in a smaller apartment (~700 sq), with access to trails, parks, and beaches close to where I live. Just wanted to submit this and see what advice y’all can hopefully give me so I can make the best decision, here.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Nope, but it’s been a minute since I had one. Grew up with a Golden Retriever as my personal dog, while there were a few other rescues we would foster here and there from the vet my mum worked at. As far as training, I have no concrete education or knowledge, but given a source to learn by I can pick it up and do whatever needs to be done.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I do not, but I don’t now if I can commit to taking care of a rescue who’s going to need help from a previous owner who treated it poorly. It’s not that I don’t want to, but I have pretty severe PTSD. I’m getting the help I need but I don’t know if I can be that same support for another living being.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Somewhat in conjunction with the last question, I’m kinda looking for a therapy dog. I’d love to get another Golden Retriever, but I don’t want my living space and infrequent hours at home to make it a terrible living experience for a dog that active. Granted, my wife is home a lot. She’s in grad school, and works weekends, but I figure I’ll be the one taking it on runs, walks, etc.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Golden Retrievers - For the reasons mentioned prior

Labradors - Similar breed, so for similar reasons

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just the basics. I’m honestly not sure what I would want to train it to do.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

At least 2-3 hours a day. I usually wake up around 0300, work out, and head to work around 0500. I usually get back around 1600, so it’s feasible to get the time in before and after work. I guess I’ll specifically say that for training and playing, whether it be going on a walk or a run. As long as I’m home I’ll interact with my dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I guess to just clarify, because I went on a tangent before, 1-2 hours, running, walking, going to a park (preferably empty when training), and socializing with people I trust who own other dogs.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can do whatever grooming is necessary, as long as I have the means to learn. So however much it takes

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably nothing that’ll get over 80-90lbs

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber, I don’t care too much about, but I do live in an apartment complex. So barking will be something I need to look out for or at least find a breed that’s trainable enough for me to manage it

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It’s important, but I don’t see there being too much opportunity for that to happen where I live. It’s really populated, lots of cars, etc.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Definitely don’t mind a snuggly dog

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Somewhere in the middle

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

To at least notify. I don’t need a dog to protect me, but knowing that it’ll at least have a presence whenever it’s just the dog and my wife makes me comfortable. So in that sense, a smaller dog wouldn’t be ideal.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I would prefer not to.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I have a cat, so I’d like to not deal with a dog that’s going to have my cat for dinner

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Some days would be around 6 hours or under, but again, my wife is in school. She’ll be in and out of the house intermittently, but not long.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

N/A

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

A cat

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We rent, but they’re super encouraging and accommodating for pets. It’s not a concern of mine.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Virginia, VA. I don’t believe so

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer - 80-100 degrees F
Winter - It can get down in the 10s

My dog is a 16 pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and she's still a puppy so she doesn't have her full adult coat yet but still quite fluffy.

43,dogs,"My dog enjoys playing with other dogs, unfortunately finding appropriate dogs is a challenge. 

I do know of one dog that is very friendly and overall stable behavior and temperament, except it belongs to a sitter on Rover so I’d be paying like $50 for like an hour play date. 

I can’t decide if that’s really unnecessary? I could reach out to a local dog group and see if anyone wants to do a local Sniffspot together, but the issue is actually believing them and trusting that they are friendly and well socialized themselves.

Because I’ve had people say their dogs are friendly (my own friends!) and their dogs are snappy if any dog comes near them. So it’s just hard to trust them?

44,dogs,"Hi! I'm looking for a dry food that tastes like treats, but is healthy for my girls.   
They eat Iams and I add a little dollop of Honest Kitchen Pour-Overs to encourage the little fuss-pots to eat. They are used to it, and eat pretty well most days. 

They need enrichment though, and I saw a feeder/puzzle/toy that the dog has to tap the top of to make a few kibbles fall out. It sounds like something they'd enjoy IF they liked the food that came out. Of course it won't work with their usual because of the sticky gravy I put on it. It also needs a full serving of food to work properly. (I suppose it's intended, in part, to slow down dogs who gobble their food too fast.) 

Their preferred treats are soft, so that won't work either, and I can't just feed them half a cup of treats! 

I don't want to go grain-free or raw, I'm hoping to find something dry that they'll think is super tasty, but is properly nutritious. 

In anticipation of (welcome!) suggestions for other kinds of enrichment items, take note: No snuffle mats or plush anything, as they rip such things to shreds in minutes, and ingest the pieces. Not good!

45,dogs,"Trigger warning this might be a bit ahem perverted.

My friend (who was my dogs foster mom) is an experienced dog trainer, foster place and dog owner and she never encountered a situation like that so I'm hoping for someone here having an idea how to deal with this. I try to give any information I think might be nessecary but please feel free to ask further questions.

I had my dog for several years now. He's 13 and spent most of his life on the streets and then 1.5 years in foster care because of his age and a minor ""optic defect"" (doesn't bother me at all besides reminding me of the hell he went trough) that he got while living on the streets. When we first met it was clear for all 3 of us that I'll adopt him before his foster mom and I even asked the ""shall we use first names or last names?"" Question. He was incredibly anxious back then and afraid of people. When I saw then coming I sat down on my heels. He swiftly sniffed my hands and then snuggled up to me as close as he could. A several hour long walk only served to show even more that we're a good fit and I'll treat him well (the dog saving organisation had difficulties with abusers trying to adopt their dogs). 

Over time he grew more confident (he now has a command that reminds him he can't just approach every person he sees for pets but has to wait until he's invited or I tell him if they're not his established friends - of which he has many) and we went trough our phases of him testing boundaries, rules and to my great delight as he was always very timid who's boss. All that lays long behind us and I think we're a good team. He can deal with noises he was afraid of like thunderstorms just by being close to me when he used to literally try and climb the walls and he is the perfect dog for my chronic health conditions as he likes to spend a few days just snuggling in bed just as much as he loves our strolls in the forest. He listens pretty well (not perfect but I'm not the perfect dog owner either and after so many years some of his street habits just remain. So I always keep Sauerkraut with bacon in the house, an eye open on our walks and my food under very good lock. Every now and then he manages to sneak something on the ground, two times we needed to go to the clinic because he got into stuff that risked a stomach blockage and I lost out on some cookies, pralines and other items because he's sneaky af) and is always docile.

My dog adores me. Like he's completely over the top attached to me. Sometimes he ""neglects"" me in favour of other beloved humans he rarely sees but most times he ignores them when I'm at hand to get my attention instead. He spends hours laying close to me or snuggled up to me looking at me with the most loving look, when I come home from grocery shopping or a doctor's appointment he acts as if I had been away forever (though he shows no other signs of separation anxiety and sleeps happily trough my absences), he always needs to be in the same room as me, preferably snuggled up to me or laying close to me, he lately even rarely leaves the bed during the night, just moves away and makes sure there are pillows between us (he used to leave to his own bed as soon as I'm asleep, I have RLS, one bad night I kicked my poor best friend black and blue while asleep) and frequently when I've been reading or knitting for more than an hour he comes up from my feet and tries to get my attention. He also started to follow me to the bathroom - he hates the bathroom and refuses to enter any bathroom under any circumstances because that is where he gets the torture of baths when he did such perfectly normal things as rolling in poop. But he overcame his bathroom hate and follows me there about half the time.

Another thing (no idea if there's any connection) is that he lately had some potty accidents in the house, after description of all circumstances his former foster mom thinks it's age catching up to me and after some changes in his potty routine they seem to have vanished.

On to the topic: lately I noticed that often when interacting with me doggo had his wiener out. Sometimes just the tip, sometimes more than an inch, it's read and swollen (nothing like the much thinner white thing he takes out to clean no matter the company). It happens when I give him belly rubs, when I pet his head or when I'm a few metres away and talking to him. A few days ago he snuggles up especially close, as if he wanted to melt into me. Half asleep I noticed he was moving more than usually and the movements seemed kinda off. Well, he had his wiener out again and was rubbing it against my comforter. And I don't mean humping, he was laying on his side, belly turned to me and rubbing against me. When I told him to stop he looked at me, got up and curled up in his usual sleeping spot a little away from me.

First I got to let everyone know I'm home now!! And my little girl is okay! When I got in she was very happy that I was home. She definitely seemed stressed at first but has relaxed quite a bit. I feel so relieved now that I'm home with her!

Secondly, I want to give everybody a big thank you for being so understanding of the situation and offering advice. When I had initially made my first post, I was anticipating a lot of hate and accusations of being a bad pet owner. Instead the large majority offered me empathy and understood that the situation I was in was out of my control. Everyone assured me she was safe and going to be okay and it helped ease me nerves a bit.


When I woke up this morning, the tram operator told me it was still too foggy for the helicopter to take off. Then at 10 am he told me the helicopter was coming. I drove to where it was going to land right away, but then I was informed the weather conditions became too bad again. He told me though that mechanics were confident they could get it fixed in a few more hours. So I waited until then and now it's running!


I know a lot of people were very curious about where I lived because of how unusual the means of transportation is to get there. I don't want to give away the exact location but I live in a rural area in the north west of Canada. The community is small, about 15 people. And are completely isolated from everything because of the large mountains surrounding us and the river divides us from everywhere else. There's no bridge to get across the river. The government has to legally provide everyone a way of transportation but because they consider a bridge too expensive for such a small population they've provided us with sky tram/cable car and a small ferry that can take two regular vehicles at a time across the river. The ferry can only operate in perfect conditions during spring and summer. If the water is too high or too low the ferry can't operate and we all need to take the tram instead that only holds 5 people at a time. During winter, the water is too low and icy so the ferry gets pulled out for the year. 

My partner and I will be getting a spare key made and we are going to give it to my neighbor incase such a situation happens again. I'm glad everything is back to normal and my animals are safe. I also have two cats that didn't even notice I was gone. And I have ducks, quails, chickens and geese but they all had plenty of water and feed still.

54,dogs,"This morning I found out we might be able to get a second dog and while my initial reaction was absolute joy, I’ve been on a rollercoaster since and am looking for some advice. 

**A few details:** 

\- Our current dog (4, female) is literally the light of our life. I know this makes us sound crazy, but everything revolves around her. We love all of her little quirks and behaviors and love giving her undivided attention. 

\- This new puppy is the same breed as a current dog and actually shares a parent (so they would be half siblings)

\- Our current dog is *extremely* social with both dogs and people, so often feel bad that she can’t be around another dog 24/7. She does, however, get jealous of other dogs receiving attention when we bring her over to family and friends’ houses who have their own pets.

My partner and I both constantly talk about getting a second dog. We both love dogs and have the time again to raise a puppy. But, now that it’s a potential reality, I have a lot of concerns. Namely the following:   


1. **New puppy may untrain some of the behaviors we love about our current dog.** She currently has no interest in begging while we’re at the table, doesn’t counter surf, and *never* barks. I have maybe heard her bark 4 times since we got her. 
2. **Food times and walks will get complicated.** Our current dog is a bit of a wanderer and always wants to play with other dogs when we walk. I know we can work on training them both together, but I worry that every walk could potentially feel like an absolute nightmare. 
3. **Our dog may lose interest in us.** I’ve heard from other double-dog households that getting another dog was great for their first pup’s wellbeing, but that they felt like they lost a big part of their relationship with their dog. 
4.  **Doubling costs.** Costs to keep up with our one dog are pretty high (dog daycare 2x /w, grooming is \~$150 per visit, she’s on prescription dog food due to allergies, etc.). I’d hope a second one wouldn’t have the same dietray issues, but the other costs will be there no matter what. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long post short, I’m feeling really conflicted and can’t decide what’s right. I could see it being so much fun having two, but I’m also worried that it might be a mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

56,dogs,"My 9 year old Springer came in from running around in the (icy) back garden, spotting blood as she walked. I couldn't see what was causing the bleeding at first, so I had to hold her and trim all the feathering from her leg and around her paw and toes (which she hates having done) soak the foot in a footbath and dry it since the bleeding became quite extensive, smearing blood everywhere. Finally once her paw was trimmed and cleaned up, could see that the blood is coming from around her dewclaw. Can't see or feel any foreign objects.  


I've applied styptic powder and some pressure, and the bleeding seems to have stopped. She's had lots of fuss and praise and a Jumbone to occupy her and hopefully stop her from licking at it for a bit.

57,dogs,"This may be a long read but i really need some advice. I've had my Chihuahua for almost 4 months now, since 8 weeks old he is about 5 and a half months now. I have taken every measure to make sure our lives are easier; he has a play crate, toys, good quality food, he plays outside under my supervision, he loves his mini frisbee and play with the ball. 

He seems happy. I've been told that I'm too controlling, i didnt let him roam the house, i correct him all the time, sometimes when he runs away from me i don't let him go potty without being on a leash for a few days.

I control him. Now i don't really know how to let him be a dog, what's normal stuff i should actually do because some are a bit inconvenient for me. I work from home. 

Now a days, I've tried to change things up, i let him go play, leash free with my neighbors dogs, just today i left his play crate door open so he can go in and out as he pleases, until he misbehaves, then it will be closed again so he can nap.

 A few weeks ago i started letting him raom the house supervised and this week a bit unsupervised. I'm terrified he will eat something he shouldn't or choke, i really like him.

My friend says I'm sick in the head but i want my Chihuahua to be well behaved. He sometimes ignores me when i tell him no, like when he eats stuff from the kitchen floor or when he is trying to eat something from the yard, i know sweep before he is allowed to roam the kitchen as well. He is surly learning and i him. I recently figured out that a certain whistle will make him come to me. 

I wash his blankets and sweaters every week or two, he is bathed every 15 to 20 days, he has all his shots, he is on flea medication and he sleeps with me.

64,dogs,"Aloha!

I recently traveled with my service dog from Hawaii to MA. The trip was almost 10 hours and he did fantastic! It was his first big flight. 

To return to Hawaii, he needs to be back within the 14 days to ensure that his health certificate is still valid. All of the other requirements have been met.

To fly direct it will be 11 hours and 20 minutes and around $1,100. I was planning on going direct but I’m worried about it being a longer flight and can already see that the plane is packed. I’m torn between a few options and am looking for input from people with SD or people who travel with their dogs regularly!

Options:
1.) direct for 11hr 20 minutes for 1,100
2.) $1,000 for a layover in LAX for 3.5 hours (total travel time of 16 hours)
3.) flying to my brother in CA, staying the night, and then jumping back on a plane the next day to finish our journey ($700)

I would save some money with option 3, but what I really care about it my dog. Is it better to fly direct and just be done with travel? Or is it worth it to stop for a 3.5 hour layover and travel consistent for 16 hours? Or fly for 6 hours and stay with my brother and then finish the rest of our trip the next day!

67,dogs,"I've been doing a lot of research on the gut microbiome lately. Although it's still a new area of research, there seems to be a lot of good studies in humans that point to the importance of dietary diversity to a healthy gut microbiome. I wasn't able to find any studies pertaining particularly to dogs however, but I can't imagine their gastrointestinal biology functions *that* much different than ours. 

I currently feed my young adult LGD a quality kibble (purina pro plan) as well as an overall joint/health supplement (platinum performance), and she's doing well on both. No allergies, body score 4.5, etc. Her one vice is that she's a prolific grazer. But I can't shake the feeling that I could be doing a better job with her nutrition, and that feeding one kibble and only kibble might be narrowing her gut biome unnecessarily. I'd like to experiment with adding a rotation of fresh foods as a portion of her diet. Right now JustFoodForDogs fresh frozen is a strong contender, as it's convenient for me to purchase, they offer a variety of ingredients, and is vet/researched backed. I'm wanting to go up to 50% of my dog's caloric intake fresh, though I'll probably start with closer to 80/20 kibble/fresh and see how that goes.

I have a 7 month old mutt, he is the sweetest, and we don’t know what breeds are mixed in him, we just know that he’ll be huge.

Since I’m 18 years old I live with my family. He gets his daily exercise, I always make sure to train him every day so I tire him out not just physically but also mentally and I give him lots of love.

Since he’s a puppy he can be a lot sometimes and my family doesn’t understand that the dog mainly reacts because of their action.

For example, my cousin (11F) complains about him jumping on her (we are working on this), I explained to her many times that if she isn’t engaging with him then he won’t jump, but no she starts screaming at him even before the dog does anything to her and goes as far as even hitting him, which my dog interprets as playing and starts jumping on her.

Today something bad happened. My grandma and her were trying to hold him so my cousin could open the gate because some guests were coming. They were tugging my dog by his collar and shouting at him for a few minutes, even though I explained them 100 times that I taught him “place” and use it in these scenarios. My dog endured it for a little bit and stayed in a sit while my grandma was holding him but then my cousin started to sprint and my puppy wanted to run after her and because he’s big my grandma fell.

94,dogs,"If so, where are these shelters?? I've seen several claims that shelters make it hard for people to adopt dogs, and it's nearly impossible to believe.

There's a huge overpopulation crisis where I live; the shelters give away dogs for $5 or free several times a year, and dogs are euthanized in the triple digits per day each summer. Our shelters literally give away as many dogs as possible and kill the rest. There's just too many dogs and not enough adopters or shelter space.

Some shelters don't even have a building or staff. It's just a fenced-in area in the middle of a field, and all the dogs' food and vet care are provided by a single volunteer. 

Our shelters have a doggy death row, and every single day at 5 pm, the dogs that weren't adopted or saved by a rescue are euthanized. Every single day, I see totally perfect dogs that are already potty trained, leash trained, kennel trained, and full of love be destroyed simply because we have too many dogs and not enough adopters.

So where the heck are these hoity toity shelters that make it impossible to adopt?? And what's their reasoning?? What do adopters do after the shelter rejects their application?

95,dogs,"
I have heard that when seeing their owner after a long separation, it often happens their heart fails, due to super excitement they feel, after months of separation. 

I have a pug. 2 y.o. Me and my mom had to move from town for couple of months, without being able to to take our boy with us. (Personal issues)

We left him with my aunt, who he also loves a lot and is very comfortable around.

So now, me and my mom are going back to town. 

I dont know how to ease it into him. 
He loves me very much. My mom doesnt live with me, but he also loves her. But I am his mommy lol.

Is there a specific way to ease the surprise into him?

Here is what I thought to dox let me know if its fine or add any of your ideas.

1. My aunt takes him back to our apartment first. He hasnt been there in months. That will already excite him
2. She will let him smell a shirt that i recently wore, so he gets a recent smell of mine.
3.  After like an hour, of being used to apartment my mom will enter the house. He will be happy .
4. and after another hour, after he calms down, i will come home

98,dogs,"Here's what's happening: 

When I take Winston outside *(9-months old, a dachshund/mini-pinscher mix)* he pees and, if I give him enough time, he poops -- when he's not too busy trying to eat everything in the yard from mulch to rocks.

When we come back into the house I give him a piece of his kibble and tell him he's a good boy. I also, when he's peeing or pooping outside tell him he's a good boy. So there's verbal praise and there's treat-praise every time he goes to the bathroom outside.

We adopted him at about 7-months old so we've had him for coming up on 3-months.

We also have another dog, much older (senior) and they get along really well. 

But he doesn't seem to be learning. My schedule is I wake up, and take him outside within 15-minutes of being awake. Then I feed him, water him, and wait 30-minutes and take him outside again.

Then I have timers set, I'm not kidding, every two hours to take him out just in case. 

And still, STILL, he shits in the house. Not so much pisses, but shits. And last night, I missed a timer, so he shit and pissed in our bed and ruined our mattress.

He's a dog, I can't get mad at him, my assumption is he has no idea what he's supposed to do, but I have tried everything I've done in the past when training puppies and none of it is working. 

And he gives my no signal, no indication of when he has to go... I mean maybe he does, but he whines CONSTANTLY and I cannot determine when he's whining for attention and when he's (if he's) trying to tell me he needs to go out.

I hoped so badly that the older dog (Jupiter) would be some how an example to him but that doesn't seem to be how it works.

101,dogs,"Some background on what the community has done so far:  


This dog was dumped in a ditch off a major highway over a month ago.  People have brought a doghouse and blankets and go out daily to refill his water and food and will sit with him and hangout.  As soon as you bring a leash out or open your car door he runs away and won't come back to you.  He wanders and sleeps in the woods but will come out to the ditch a few times a day and will sit and watch the cars go by.  Animal control is aware and even trapped him last week, but a sheriff deputy responded and tried getting him out of the trap and he got loose and ran.  He's now not going anywhere near the traps.    


The dog will come up to a few people that have been feeding him and will let you pet him.  The first time I ever met him he ran right up to me and licked my face so I believe he somewhat already trusts me.  But any movement sends him into a panic.   It's been over a month and not a single person has gained his trust enough to get a leash on him.   


I don't want to hurt the dog but I believe it's going to come down to someone distracting him with treats and pets and then someone slowly comes up behind him just to grab him long enough to get him into a car.  He's a medium sized pitbull, 40-50 pounds at most.  I understand no one wants to walk up on a dog and surprise grab them for their own safety but at this point what can anyone else do...AC and the Humane society keep telling the community to stop feeding him, so he gets hungry enough to go into the traps but people either aren't listening or aren't on social media to see those requests, so he continues to be fed.  


Reddit experts, what can I do?  I'm fully invested in this dog and have plans on bringing him home.  I've spoken with the Humane Society director and he said if I can foster they will sponsor the dog until he finds a permanent home.  I'm not a dog rescue expert by any means, so I don't know what is the best way forward.  


TLDR: Stray dog has been living in a ditch for 1+ month.  No one can catch him to include Animal Control.  Locals keep feeding him so dog doesn't go hungry, but this is keeping him from the traps because he knows he'll get food from people that stop for him.  About to get really cold this weekend so I'm desperate and will do anything to get this dog home.  Please help!

102,dogs,"Earlier this year my folks got a pound puppy, who is like the best dog in the world. My dad was going nuts trying to figure out what she was so I got him the Embark test for Father's day, including the genetic health screening.

So, I bought my dog from a backyard breeder with CKC papers. I didn't know better. She has an awful temperament, but also has had some serious health issues requiring 3 major surgeries the last few years and now we work to manage chronic pain. She is a chihuahua.

My sister got the family hooked on Chis 20+ years ago. She got her little boy who was just love and sweetness, and she wanted to put more of him in the world. She got him a companion and they had 2 sets of puppies that she gave (not charged) to trusted friends and family. I was too young for a dog of my own, but loved our family dogs, hence me getting my little puppers when I was financially able.

So here is the deal. My sister is looking into breeding again. She is looking for dogs with champion backgrounds Iike her original dogs had and I've been ""approved"" for a puppy when the time comes. 

I can deal with a grumpy, disobedient dog. Whatever. I can deal with pee (I'm getting LVP floors). What I cannot deal with is watching a dog go through surgery again. If I ever go to hell I will relive my little grumpkins first surgery. 

Is the Embark testing Iike a thing? Would it be appropriate to ask her to ask the breeder for genetic testing to make sure that there are no defects with the dog? I realize I sound like an asshole, but anyone that has had to have major surgery on their dogs will get it. Hell is the only word for it. 

And if you are single like me, get a good friend or family member to be with you the first day if your dog does need surgery. 

FYI, our pup Daisy from those first Chis lived to be 20. One had leukemia (also ours), but my sister took a third one away from one of her friends when she found out the dog wasn't in a good environment, and my folks took her in too. She lived to like 18.

103,dogs,"About two months ago, my shiba was having accidents in the house. She was constantly thirsty. Lost a lot of weight. We took her to her usual animal hospital, which happened to have a new veterinarian. We mentioned that we thought it could be diabetes. We’re familiar with the symptoms since my sibling has it. We had a full blood test done on my girl. Doctor assured that it was not diabetes, said it was actually something wrong with her liver. She gave us medication said to finish out the bottle and she should be fine. 

Two months pass. My girl started getting cataracts. I thought it made sense since she’s 10 that it would start to happen. Then about a week and a half ago, she woke up one morning and she was crashing into things, wasn’t able to look at me, she was blind. We made an appointment with an ophthalmologist, had her looked at. He asked when’s the last time she had blood work, we said two months ago, he said he thought it might have been diabetes but he figured not since the blood work was done so recently. It’s just regular cataracts, gave us eye drops and sent us home.

Then one week ago exactly. I thought she was going to die. She didn’t want to eat. Didn’t want to get up and go for a walk. Wouldn’t respond to her name. She was so weak and in addition to that, her eyes looked worse. She was squinting, unable to open her eyes. Called her vet, they weren’t in. I took her to the emergency vet. They asked when’s the last time she had blood work, we said about two months ago. They said it must just be her eyes and were about to send me home with just eye drops but I knew there was something more. I asked them to do a whole blood panel. Well when it came back, my dog had a blood sugar of 327. She was diabetic. The emergency vet told me that maybe she just wasn’t two months ago.

Then two days ago, her primary vet called me. Asked me how my big baby was doing. I told her, not great. That in the two months since we last saw her, my big baby was now blind and diabetic. She put me on hold. Started reading bits from the blood work, then said “Oh. She did have an elevated blood sugar. I don’t know why I didn’t check that.” “I should have check that, I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. I’m not a perfect human being.” I started bawling. 

Took her to another vet yesterday, they let me look over that blood work from two months ago. Her blood sugar was 311 on that day we were assured she wasn’t diabetic. The new vet said she was surprised that my dog didn’t die in the two months she was dealing with untreated diabetes.

I’m so heart broken. Maybe my baby wouldn’t be blind just yet. How long was she suffering for? And now she can’t see at all. She’s so scared to just walk around our house. But, I can say since the insulin after a week, she’s getting back to her old self. She’s happier and more playful. I just can’t get over that this vet completely ignored the blood work, told us we were wrong about it being diabetes. And the fact that she was not apologetic on the phone hurts even more. I hope this never happens to anyone else.",t2_4miiys3s,0,"Vet ignored elevated blood sugar, my dog was living with untreated diabetes and now completely blind.","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,znh2zm,True,krulequeen,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/znh2zm/vet_ignored_elevated_blood_sugar_my_dog_was/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/znh2zm/vet_ignored_elevated_blood_sugar_my_dog_was/,2471945,1671204048,0,,False,1671204076,1671204077,2022-12-16 15:20:48,,,,,,,
104,dogs,"when i was out walking my dog last night, i heard aggressive barking coming from up the street. i didn’t think much of it at first, but as i inches closer to the road, i got a bit weary wondering where the dog was. i saw a parked car across the street and figured it was someone’s dog in their car barking because they spotted mine. reasonable enough. 

as we kept on walking, passing the car that is parked across the road from the sidewalk we’re walking on, this beast of a dog climbs out of the car window, charges at us and begins mauling my dog. i screamed for help for what felt like years, but it was probably over a minute before the owner came out of the house and noticed. this dog was relentless in its attack. i tried pulling him off of my dog, hesitantly as i was in a crazy panic and was scared this dog would then turn on me. all of my efforts and he did not budge. it was horrifying. my dog wound up in a fetal position, submitting and crying. when the owner came out finally she had to wrestle him off of mine. it took a minute and once she did her dog reacted and bit her in the face. 

we brought him back from the ER around 2 last night. he has numerous puncture wounds in his back, his legs and his groin. he’s been on tons of pain killers and antibiotics, the recovery is awful. he’s bleeding out everywhere, peeing on himself, falling over, just completely out of it. he’s been unable to lie down because his genital area is completely torn up. he stood for 7 hours straight last night, nodding off while standing and nearly falling over each time. thankfully, hr is finally lying down now. 

the owner begged us not to “make a big deal out of it” and while i have so much anger in my heart, i don’t think i can be responsible for putting a dog down. she claims he has never shown any signs of aggression but given what i witnessed last night, i find it very hard to believe. her dog was a monster. i’m just so lost i don’t know what to do.

105,dogs,"Hi all! I'm sure these posts come up often, but I'm posting because I truly need another perspective and perhaps some advice about what to do about this situation. 

I want to preface this post by saying that I have no reservations with or about pitbulls or pitbull mixes as a breed, and I fully believe that the way a dog is raised, trained, and cared for has everything to do with their temperament. I have had problems with other pitbull mixes in the neighborhood -- such as one male in particular who is allowed to roam around off-leash and has not been fixed (he is particularly aggressive and has been a problem in the past). 

This post, however, is about three pitbull mixes that I am very concerned about. They live in the backyard of a neighbor two doors down from us. Up until recently, the lived in cages inside the garage, even in the heat of the summer. (For reference I live in SC, USA where the summers are particularly hot and muggy, and the winters are milder, although we do get freezes and snow). Currently the three of them are chained up outside in the backyard with a plastic kennel each. Rain or shine they are left outside, and as it has begun to get colder, I have noticed that they are a lot more lethargic. One in particular hardly moves from one spot. She looks like a sad little lump out in the weather, not even going inside her hut anymore. I feel sick every time I see them out there, and it makes me angry because we live in a nice neighborhood and it is clear that the neighbors only have them outside for ""security.""

My questions are these: for those of you that have reported neglect, how have you gone about it? Has it generally been successful? Have you faced repercussions from the owners? Or am I just overreacting all together, and should I just mind my own business? I appreciate those of you who have taken a chance to read this post and respond.

109,dogs,"For context I live in a strict HOA neighborhood. I have a setter mix who loves to sniff and mark along walks. My issue is that we live in this strict HOA neighborhood. I take her on a route that has 5 potty spots, and I always stop at every one to let her do her thing. My husband and I have been trying to get her to walk with her head up, because otherwise she has her nose to the ground the entire walk and stops frequently to mark.

We have a walker come two days a week who walks her for an hour. I realized that the walker was letting her mark along the walk as she wished, so I told her that we don't let her do that, so she needs to stop letting her do so. It's confusing to the dog to be able to do it with one person, and not otherwise. The walker said she wouldn't stop, that it's a dog thing and that we should let her. 

If I didn't live in an hoa neighborhood, and if there weren't so many potty spots then I would probably handle things differently, but I am admittedly put off by the walker telling me how to handle things.

128,dogs,"A little background story:

I have a 2-years-old neutered female Pomapoo (recently her vet said her breed was misidentified and she's probably of another spitz breed if this helps). She's the first dog I ever took resposibility for. She was rehomed to us when she was 5~6 months old. I love her and would do anything for her. 

I am her owner, but she has a stronger bond with my mom and I think she sees my mom as her owner. I had to come terms with it since I can't do much about it. Mom tries to help me as much as she can but no one can force her to take full responsibility of a dog that she doesn't own. So, even if my dog doesn't trust me as her owner, I have my responsibilities as her true owner and I have to feed her, walk her, play with her etc. Luckily she likes me and our human-dog relationship is great in contrast to our owner-dog relationship. 

We have some problems we have been working on, such as fear-biting and resource guarding, but in this post I'd like to talk about another one:

Walking/going out. She's afraid of going out when I'm ""alone"" with her. She sometimes doesn't let me put on her harness and even if she does and we walk outside, she suddenly gets scared, refuses to walk and tries to escape back to home.

She is not afraid of me, but I think she doesn't trust me? She only exhibits this behavior when she goes out alone with me. When someone else, for example my mom or my brother is with us, she enjoys the walk. They just walk besides me, I am still the one holding the leash.

I find this so weird, and to a certain extent, worrying. When there's no one to accompany me, she refuses to walk and I have to exercise her at home by other activities. The problem is, it doesn't seem to be enough and not walking enough worsens her behavioral problems.

I've never (and would never) done anything that hurt her when we were alone. Even the opposite, I'm her play buddy, we cuddle at nights, spend lots of time together (just the two of us) and we have a good relationship. 

I don't know why she particularly resists walking with me alone. I'd really appreciate your advice.",t2_8erkr43g,0,My dog refuses to walk with me.

130,dogs,"My 13 year old German Shepherd/Beagle mix slept in the same room in our house her entire life with no problems. She has a bed that we’ve replaced every few years or so, water, and a rug to switch to if she wants a different spot to lay on.

A few months ago, she started peeing in the house. A lot. But it was only at night or when we were home. She would hold it for the 8 hours we were at work. We took her to the vet who checked her for a UTI. Test was negative, but the vet gave us antibiotics anyway just in case it was early on in the infection. The frequent urinating stopped.

Around this time, she started barking to get out of her room. Nothing we tried worked to keep her happy there. I took her to the bathroom. Tried comforting her. Tried adjusting the thermostat. Tried ignoring her. Nothing was working. So I brought her to my room and she calmed down.

I don’t have anything against her sleeping in our room, but she’s waking me up a ton. I’m not the best sleeper, so nighttime waking can keep me up for an hour before I fall back asleep. She scratches her bed - a lot. Like she’s nesting. She gets up for water (we put an extra bowl in our room) a few times. She scratches and licks herself. And she also wakes up some time between 4:45-5:30 wanting to go out and eat. 

She’s not showing any other signs of dementia. The doctor ran a test for arthritis as her hips look pretty frail, but she said there weren’t any significant signs of it. 

For the past 6 weeks, I’m averaging around 4-5 hours of sleep per night and it’s really draining me. I have a 9 year old son and a 4 year old daughter, and I’ve been useless to them in the afternoons/evenings because I’m so tired.

Is it possible to get her to sleep in her own room again? Any suggestions?

Edit - She will sleep soundly in our living room if she has access to the couch. We got a few good nights of sleep that way. But she started peeing again on the hardwood floors, so that quickly stopped being an option. She didn’t bark or anything. It’s like she just hopped down to pee and then went back to bed.",t2_nfwlc,0,Elderly dog keeps waking me up throughout the night - any suggestions for re-training her to sleep in her room?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zncoy0,True,NoPatNoDontSitonThat,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zncoy0/elderly_dog_keeps_waking_me_up_throughout_the/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zncoy0/elderly_dog_keeps_waking_me_up_throughout_the/,2471898,1671190874,0,,False,1671191528,1671191529,2022-12-16 11:41:14,,,,,,,

145,dogs,"Since I started college I havent been able to see my pets at home that much and but recently I've realized my parents havent been cutting my dog's nails at all. They say this is because he's too scared of getting his nails trimmed and there's nothing they can do. Instead, they take him to the vet's pretty much once a year. However, they can't even trim the nails completely at the vet's because his nails get so long that the quicks get long too. I try to tell them this neglect of his nails has bad health effects for the dog but they haven't paid it mind. His paws seem splayed a bit and when the nails are really bad they grow in a weird tilted way so he can walk on them. At least he doesnt show outward signs of pain but I'm worried.

During school breaks I've been trying to get the dog more used to getting his nails cut, and have had some progress; I was able to cut the nails a bit but they were so long and many of them grew close to the paw in a curve that it was hard to cut them quickly and safely with clippers before my dog would ran away. I had no choice but to wait for when my parents chose to take him to the vet, and even then I had to keep reminding them to make an appointment after they said they would. It feels like I'm the only one who cares about this dog's hygeine and bringing up his nails to them all the time feels like I'm being annoying, but they still don't help. This is also part of a worrying pattern where they seem to have lost interest in doing anything with the dog that requires effort but will help him, like bathing him or taking him to the dog park.

I need to do something now and I see my options as either hiring a trainer to come to the house help him get over this fear (if trainers like that even exist), or booking a grooming appointment to get him used to nail clipping being a normal thing, even though he's still pretty afraid of it along with  bathing. I could also try to train him more this winter break and try to cut his nails if he's not ready for these but it might not be a while before I see him again. Either way I feel there might be some backlash from them because they're weirdly defensive about this.",t2_88fvrplw,0,"Parents won't cut dogs nails, I can't while at college","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zn9gjv,True,Select-Ad8271,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zn9gjv/parents_wont_cut_dogs_nails_i_cant_while_at/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zn9gjv/parents_wont_cut_dogs_nails_i_cant_while_at/,2471866,1671177664,0,,False,1671178826,1671178827,2022-12-16 08:01:04,,,,,,,

149,dogs,"I've recently read Why We Love the Dogs We Do: How to Find the Dog That Matches Your Personality by Stanley Coren. The book states that in each breed group, there are breeds with different personalities, so just because eg. one herding breed is a good match for a person, it does not mean that another herding breed will be. The author proposes several personality groups instead, and attempts to match certain personalities of people to those of the dogs.

Now, I picked up this book hoping that it would be a good addition to Meet Your Dog: The Game-Changing Guide to Understanding Your Dog's Behavior by Kim Brophey, which details the general characteristics of diffeent breed groups. But, to be quite honest, I was disappointed. The premise sounded promising, but the book did not deliver. I was hoping to learn more about the more nuanced individual breed differences among breed groups, and I did not. Only few lines in the beginning of the book were dedicated to this:

""For instance, the hound group includes the friendly and sociable Beagle and Basset Hounds and also the sharp, tough-minded Thodesian Ridgebacks and Basenjis. The toy group includes the solitary and independent Manchester Terrier and the sociable ""love-sponge"" that is the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The sporting group includes the stable and unflappable Clumber Spaniel and also the playfully hyperactive Irish Setter. The herding group includes the submissive and sometimes skittish Shetland Sheepdog and the dominant and self-confident German Shepherd.""

I'd be curious to know whether there are any resources about this, or what are your own experiences with different breeds from the same group, or vice versa, remarkably similar breeds from different groups, since I do agree with the author at least in that the breed descriptions in books, articles, videos and on other websites tend to include the same ""buzz words"" and in the end, tell one very little about what would a life with a dog of a certain breed be in general. This would be, of course, about breed tendencies disregarding differences between individual dogs.

156,dogs,"My grandaunt has a Border Collie / Australian Shepherd mix, who is very much overweight. She is a senior (can't remember how old off hand), and has arthritis. She can barely get up. My aunts ex husband only fed her cheese and crackers, and never walked her, which is why she is in this condition.

My aunt lives in a older person lot home, and can't walk her because of the rules against dogs. She also can't get her into her car, because she's too heavy to pick up and can't make the jump. I think she is on a diet, but I'm not sure.

I'm not really in a position to take the dog, but I would if I could. I'm also not in a position where I could go over and help her excersice the dog every day, which Is what she'd need. (And I don't think she would excersice her on her own).

She lays in the house all day except to eat and go to the bathroom in the tiny strip of grass behind my aunts house (not big enough to do anything in. Maybe two feet wide and ten feet long).

I don't know what to do here. Maybe it's not my place to interfere, but I feel so bad for that dog. She's the sweetest dog, and deserves to be living out her senior years happy and healthy.

Any suggestions are welcome. Please not just criticism against my aunt, I'm looking for solutions here.

158,dogs,"My whippet Podrick (M/2) just got neutered 5 days ago. 
(Before anyone comes for me for doing this late, my partner and I had personal/financial complications hence why the delay and our vet also said it was fine to still do it at this age)

He was a cryptorchid case as only one ‘marble’ descended. 

We dropped him off Mon morning for the procedure and was advised all went well. He was groggy the night of and was back to normal from Tues morning. He isn’t crate trained but we have him wearing the e-collar (to his dismay) and I’ve been monitoring him like a hawk when I’m not sleeping.

We put him to his own bed at night which is in our bedroom but he tends to jump on our bed in the middle of the night. 
Wed night I find a small patch of blood on our doona. It didn’t look like it was just blood, looked like it was mixed with a clear fluid (I’m assuming this may be serous but please correct me if I am wrong) and we just assumed this was normal as it wasn’t excessive bleeding and just took it like normal weeping.

Last night (Thurs) my partner and I noticed more dry patches of blood on his legs and noticed the wound was still weeping. Again, not excessively but small amounts throughout the night.

Today (Fri) I decided to take him to the vet to get a second opinion as I’m starting to get concerned as the weeping still is coming and going but it is day 5 since the procedure. They said everything is all good and it’s just the body releasing the fluids from the wound. I need to also add that he was resisting the vet when we were there so he was very active.
I got home and the weeping just wouldn’t stop for about an hour.

It’s been a couple of hours now, and the weeping looks more like a semi-translucent dark reddy/brown and isn’t as much as what it was like a couple of hours ago. 

I have another follow up with the vet on Mon, but I wanted to know if anyone else experienced this with their cryptorchid neutered dog? I’m keen to hear how your dog’s recovery and healing time went, if you experienced the same thing, and if anyone knows whether this is normal or not.

161,dogs,"I have 3 male dogs and 1 female puppy. The first male dog (~7years) is like my son and he mated with my grandmothers dog, and one of his sons lives with us (~5years), lastly we rescued a dog that’s about 3-4 years old as well. All the males are not neutered and we never really had any issues until we got the third male dog and the second one was well into “adulthood.” The oldest one was the only dog for a while and is everyone’s favorite so he’s used to the attention and is a very jealous dog. By favorite I mean that he gets more attention from strangers etc but of course, we treat all the dogs the same, more like he’s a bit of a brat. Anyways, the father and son started fighting every now and then and sometimes they’d get a bit scratched up but nothing severe. It would usually be when we give attention to the other dogs and the eldest gets jealous and starts growling, and trying to get attention, but no biting, until the others bite him first. The rescue and the second dog are both very close and they gang up on the eldest too. Recently, the second dog bit the eldest on the eye pretty badly and would NOT let go, even when we threw water on him or if someone tried to pull him away or hit him (to make him let go). Since I live away from home, my mother wants to give the second dog away due to his aggression (he also tries to run away a lot), and I am stressed because I am from an area where eating dog meat is a practice (I am not against people eating dog meat but don’t want my dog who grew up as a pet to be eaten— I will not tolerate any racist comments, it’s a different culture!) — so basically I don’t want to give my dog away, and I don’t want to have him put down. Should we neuter him well into adulthood? What can we do about his aggression? Has any of you been able to ‘cure’ your dogs from this behavior?

174,dogs,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I've taken care of family dogs. The first was a female teacup toy poodle, who was with us since I was 8 years old up until I was 23. There was a time when she lived with me for two months straight during and after college. My mom and sister recently got dogs, a two-year-old goldendoodle, and a ten-year-old Yorkie, and I've babysat them both on occasion.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would like to go through a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I am a single woman who works hybrid at home and at the office. I would like a dog who I know will make me feel safe but is also of calm temperament. I really don't want the dog to be too clingy or high-strung. They need to be smart, obedient, and at ease. They can be friendly and enjoy occasional cuddles, but otherwise, I don't mind if they're independent.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Chow Chow, for all the above reasons, but I worry about their aggressive reputation. I would like to have friends and family visit without me feeling nervous they'll get bitten if they don't properly interact with my dog. 

I once considered Samoyeds because they are beautiful and affectionate, but because of their very active demeanors, I'm not 100% sure if we'll be a good match. Maybe it would be a good excuse to get out the house? But they also may be a little *too* friendly. I need a dog that will protect me, not wag its tail at my would-be attacker.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*  I want the dog to know when to indicate it needs to go to the bathroom, a dog that will sit when I tell it to sit, roll over for tummy rubs, shake my hand, basic things like that. Not trying to impress anyone. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression, and I'm considering registering my dog as an Emotional Support Animal, so that is why obedience and calm temperament is important to me. I have no experience working with this specialty though.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I want to have a puppy and raise it, so I'm willing to put in as much time as necessary or enroll the puppy in daycare so it gets the socialization and training it needs. I don't intend to leave it alone for hours. On days that I work from home, my time won't be limited at all, so 3-5 hours during the puppy phase. 1-2 hours once its foundational training is stabilized.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We can do 30 minute walks daily and hit up the dog park once or twice a week.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I plan on brushing my dog 3 times a week and taking them to the groomer once a month  

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium to large (but not super large)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* shedding, I can tolerate, but would prefer as minimal. Barking and slobber, not much at all.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I don't plan on doing that, so not at all.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* personal space (but doesn't mind snuggles from time to time)

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* do its own thing

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Bark if it's a stranger. Bark and calm down once they recognize who it is and then greet them in a friendly way (walking up for pats, licking, etc.)

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Temperamental, nippy, territorial dogs make me nervous. That's why I'm not explicitly saying I want a *guard* dog, because I don't want my pup to be angry or to bite people (or me) unexpectedly. I just want them to be able to know when to guard and when to love instead of blindly doing either for anyone. Is that wanting my cake and to eat it too? Mainly, I just want it to be chill.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Four days out of the week, it won't be alone. I will be with it all day. The other three days, I'll be absent for 7 hours. However, when it's a puppy, I plan to work remotely exclusively and be home all day, 7 days a week. I also plan to take it to doggy daycare, which I would do anyway so it can socialize with other people and dogs.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. There's a 75lb weight limit.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Los Angeles, California, but I'll be moving to New York, New York in 2023. In NYC, Dobermans, Rottweilers, and Pitbulls are restricted. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* it's 50's to 60's F right now, but New York will be much cooler

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

181,dogs,"# Hi. Sorry in advance for the long post! But I feel like context might help. If you don't have time to read; TLDR - anxious dog is a pain in the neck and I think my sister's decision to let him ""whine it out"" is wrong. Am I wrong, or is she?

Full context - so I'm not the owner of the dog, but the dog owner (my sister) lives with me. The dog has just turned 3, and is extremely needy around my sister. He follows her like a shadow bolted to her ankle, but is good tempered and generally well behaved most of the time.

My sister's bedroom, and his crate, are downstairs. He's fine when my sister leaves the house if someone is downstairs with him, but, everyone else's bedrooms are upstairs - where as part of the rules for her moving in with him, he is absolutely NOT allowed. For a few reasons (safety, proximity to other open doors, not wanting him on the furniture, etc) he is locked in the kitchen/dining room behind a stair gate when my sister leaves the house and no one else is downstairs. His crate, water, food etc are all in this area with him.

This dog howls like a goddamn banshee when my sister leaves. My very first post on Reddit was an AITA about this dog where I described it as ""scream-crying"", and I stand by that phrasing. ***It. Is. Unbearable***. I am not a dog person anyway and hate the sound of dogs whining (it's truly nails down a chalkboard for me) but I have never heard a dog this loud, consistent or dramatic. He does not stop.

I work odd shifts and so sometimes need to catch up on a bit of sleep during the day, so it's not as simple as ""why don't you just go downstairs when your sister goes out?""

This has resulted in several arguments, but an hour in to him scream-crying today, I lost my rag, and texted my sister and said she needed to come home. I didn't word it particularly nicely, but I wasn't about to let her go and do another 2/3 hours of shopping and socialising whilst I had to sit and listen to him doing this, whilst I'm trying to sleep. I also said that I was no longer willing to wait downstairs with him, ""babysitting"" him when she goes out late at night with her friends or boyfriend. She'll have to be home by a certain time, so that I can get to bed in time for my own schedule, or she'll have to go out to dog-friendly pubs/take the dog to her boyfriend's place. She's been huffy about it and when I tried to bring it up, she said she's done her research and he needs to just ""whine it out"". He'll get bored/tired and stop eventually over time.

I guess that kind of makes sense? Like he won't get what he wants, and eventually stop? But he's been left alone and whined for literally *hours* on end before, so it hasn't worked up til now. Plus I feel bad for him. As much as I don't like having a dog in the same house as me, and he irritates the ever-loving crap out of me, I don't view this as his fault.

185,dogs,"Hey all, I’m really under some stress thinking about all this so I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on this issue.

In 2019, when I was still in college, my father gave my dog away.

I had this dog, Jake, since 2016.I paid for both food and vet care for them. I think the only reason he gave the dog away was to punish me because I had recently come out of the closet about my sexuality. One day while I was working the shift at the Starbucks at my University I got a text from my father saying “I’m giving your dog away”

I tried calling him but he just repeated himself then hung up on me and wouldn't answer the phone.

I called my mother and begged her to let me keep the dogs. She said I could only have them if I would keep them myself.

I didn't even have a bedroom of my own at the time. I had three other roommates and they already had a dog. Still I begged my mother to bring them to me, since I didn’t have a car. She agreed but then never fucking came and brought them.

Eventually I stopped calling cause I knew they were only doing it to torture me for being gay or something. I was in my last year of college and had no money and wasn't even sure I could take care of the dogs. I contacted the police and told them I didnt want my parents to contact me anymore. I was even encouraged by the police to get a restraining order. I hadn't talked to my family at all 2020-2021.

Not having my dogs has been eating me alive these years. I felt so guilty. Like I abandoned them. As soon as I got a job and my own apartment I reached out to my brother asking if he knew if the dogs were still alive or not. He gave me the one they kept back.

But when I asked him where Jake, my other dog, was he wouldn't tell me.

Jake is around 6 years old now. I don't want to take him away from his current home if he’s being taken care of and happy. But I just want to see him again and know that he is being taken care of.

I am afraid of pursuing the matter and getting police involved because I’m worried if my parents ask for Sandy back the police will take her from me, even though I love her so much and I’m actually giving her all the veterinary treatment she needs since she's 13 and has arthritis.

Please, is there anything I can do to get my dog Jake back? Do I have a claim?

197,dogs,"I've been reading a couple of posts on this sub about dog owners who find it hard to take vacations because they don't know what to do with their dog/s. 

 If I were you, I would begin to socialize your dogs with your dog loving friends/neighbors asap. I moved to a new state and met my neighbors dog about 4 months ago. I used to be afraid of him but the neighbor let us spend alot of time together and I eventually fell in love with this doggo. Began to walk him alot and got compensated for it too. 

Now this neighbor has gone to Mexico on a 5 week vacation and I've moved to his place with my essentials for a month. The dog is in my care and it brings me so much joy to be with him! I'm getting paid a small amount every week but honestly I would have done it for free. What makes it easier is that the dog and I have a very strong bond after months spending time together. I know him very well, what he likes, dislikes, his triggers, body language etc. 

So my neighbor is happily chilling in Mexico unbothered and not worried about his doggo in a scary kennel or something because he identified me as a potential doggy nanny and fairly compensated me. 

I take the doggo out every day and enjoy every moment with him so this doesn't even feel like a job. More like a sleepover lol. So in conclusion, help your dog make human friends and identify people whom you can trust that you know love your doggo so that in the event that you want to leave town for a bit or a long time, you'll know who to entrust your dog with.

 I'm not sure if I explained any of this well but I tried.

208,dogs,"I had a 1-on-1 with my boss today and we were chatting about random things before we got to work stuff. 

Two weeks ago, I brought my dog to an employee social event that was outdoors at a park. I asked ahead of time if I could bring him and was told he was welcome. My dog was very well behaved and friendly to everyone there who wanted to pet him. I was able to socialize normally and enjoy the company of my coworkers. 

About 6 months ago, I brought him to a similar work event where he was…pretty demanding of my attention and not very  calm. Nothing terrible happened, but I couldn’t really socialize because I was managing him. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have brought him and I felt a bit embarrassed. People were very understanding, especially since it was an informal social event. 

I’ve worked a lot with my dog since then, spending a lot of time training him and teaching him to engage with me. My dog is mildly leash reactive to certain dogs and can get overstimulated in some environments, even though he is not reactive to people. We go to a lot of dog-friendly places around the city and have gradually built up the number of distractions and level of activity. We can go most places now and his behavior is quite good. 

During our meeting today, when referring to the event a couple of weeks ago, my boss said, “wow he was like a different dog from the one you brought 6 months ago! He was so calm and well-behaved. You’ve done amazing with training him.”

209,dogs,"Hi! So my partner and I are in the process of going to our local shelter to potentially get a second dog. I got my current dog (a cattle dog/Pitt bull mix) from the same shelter and we have had her for two years now. She’s approximately 5 - hard to know with rescues! The dog I’m looking at potentially adopting is another cattle dog (mutt of some sort) and he’s about 8 per the shelter. This will be my first time having two dogs (assuming the park meet and greet at the shelter goes okay) , and I’m wondering what advice people may have!

Things I’m specifically curious about:

- how to manage the first few nights with a new dog. Our current dog has free roam of the house and often gets into bed with us around 5am. Would you recommend making a safe space for the new dog in their own room and keeping our current dog in our room? Or any version of that. 

- how to manage the first time you are out of the house at work and the dogs being left alone. I’m leaning towards keeping them separate especially early on, then trialing short trips away once they’re more established with each other and comfortable. 

To note/what I’ve read up on
- we don’t crate, and hopefully don’t plan to but we could train if necessary
- our current dog does great with other dogs at day care, and has been fine with friends dogs coming over and us paying other dogs attention
- the new dog was found with a buddy dog roaming the streets and is already potty trained/walks well on leash
- all toys are getting “confiscated” for awhile and the new dog will get his own toys
- we will do separate feeding times and in separate rooms to limit possible issues

I saw a vet informally at work a few months back, like 8 months go, she checked out some lumps I saw on Lucy (the dog) that were pea size and now they’re probably golf ball size. There’s about 6 of them. As she doesn’t live with me I hadn’t noticed. Lucy has the worst smell I’ve ever come across, the best way to describe it is rotting meat but she’s still very bubbly, sociable, active, good appetite. Just her usual self. She had phantom pregnancies up until two years a go so I was thinking maybe a blockage. She is booked in at the vets for Saturday and the only reason she hasn’t been sooner is because covid didn’t allow us to but apart from that she would usually have checkups quite often it’s only until covid hit that we couldn’t go.

216,dogs,"my dog unfortunatly has lymphona, he was being treated by a vet, treated with vincristine and duroxobine, a chemo protocol used here.

Protocol apareantly seemed to be working fine for 2 months but now this week he got worse.

3 days ago he got belly fluids, took him to the vet and they did take fluid out sent to be looked, came back as cancer cells, what i read this is called maligne ascites dont know if im correct.

now he is a bit more tired, still goes for walks, drinks water, recognises us, sleep more, his breathing is ok, still pees, today he did 2 times diahrea, and seemed to be dehydrated.

 we went to another vet, he did some bloodworks, told us he had high tbil (billirubin), the rest was kind of ok, but he feels sad and a bit down.

 his lymphoma was only found 2 months ago on stage v.

this new vet oncologist said the fluid would only go away of the condition is treated, and we could figth or wait for the worst, he gave us lumostine, its a chemo drug, but i read its very agressive and it could end up making him even worse and end up in the hospital, this is a very hard decision, as he has fluids on his belly and couldnt find any information if this has been used in a dog in his condition.

Any vet or vet oncologist here that could help clarifiyng please?

i just feel so sad and hopeless because 2 months ago, when it was found, he was also getting bad and after first treatments he looked more like himself, even done his long walks with us near the beach, and now he looks like crap, so sad, so down, still recognising us and drinking water but we had to push food down his troath, he ocasionaly during his treatment eated roatsierrie chicken, 50-100g but he was very picky and we had to push food to help him, cant understand why this happened and took a bad turn.

hope any  vet or vet oncologist here can help me or clarify if Lomustine is safe or very dangerous used as a last resource and in a dog with cancer fluids,in his case or as a rescue protocol, as basicaly this is our last option, either that or let him get more fluid and get worse day by day :(

Microscopic Findings:
Sarcoma: Soft tissue sarcoma vs histiocytic sarcoma

Comment:
The mass is a sarcoma. A soft tissue sarcoma grade 3 and histiocytic sarcoma. Any evidence of joint involvement?
If the clinical presentation warrants consideration for histiocytic sarcoma, immunohistochemical staining for CD18 may help. Stains can be ordered by contacting Customer Service

Microscopic Description:
Examined are sections of a multinodular neoplasm. The neoplasm is composed of streams of spindle to rounded cells with scant stroma. The cells have indistinct cell borders, moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei, stippled chromatin. There is severe anisokaryosis and anisocytosis with rare multinucleated cells and karyomegaly. There are more than 20 mitoses in 10 HPF (2.37 mm2).
Portions of the mass are necrotic, less than 50%.There is no evidence of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion.(extends to margins-partial submission)All of the submitted tissue has been processed and examined,",t2_dojvuojj,0,Biopsy results for soft tissue sarcoma,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zmuc0c,True,Emergency_Seesaw_929,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zmuc0c/biopsy_results_for_soft_tissue_sarcoma/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zmuc0c/biopsy_results_for_soft_tissue_sarcoma/,2471654,1671134037,0,,False,1671134051,1671134052,2022-12-15 19:53:57,,,,,,,

Its with some kind of sadness that I reach to you, my puppy (6 months old) just bite me (not kindly) because I tried to pick up some plastic paper that he find...

I can understand why he did that with his toy, but with fucking paper plastic ?  


And the worst in all that, is that he didnt growl as warning sign, he bite me directly (not very hard, but I can tell that it was bad, like not a playful snap)...  


Yesterday, I give him some hit with my pillow, but today I didnt cause I read that we shouldnt (ofc we shouldnt hit our dog, but I did cause I didnt what to do on the moment, and I was sad and angry)  


I spend one hour today teaching him I am not a threat and I will still give him his toy after telling the order ""drop"" but I did it again nevertheless. I know we cant learn something in one hour, but still...   


Im afraid he will continue to do that growing up, and worst, i'm afraid ressentment will grow toward him...

232,dogs,"I need some advice on jealousy/aggression between my dogs.

Okay my dad has a dog named Mars who is almost 2. He honestly doesn't know any tricks and is... not intelligent. But he loves attention and always got excited when I'd come over. Anyways last month I got a dog for myself and moved in with my dad. His name is Poe and he is 3 months. He is incredibly smart, and loves attention as well. Anyways they both fight for my attention. Poe is *my* dog so I tend to give him more attention and do lots of training with him (hoping he can become a service dog for me), but whenever I give Mars attention, even just a single pet or pick him up, Poe gets upset and lunges at Mars.

Now, Mars is extremely unsocialized so doesn't understand when dogs want to play so usually barks at them, so it usually ends in fight that I break up by yelling ""HEY"" and they usually stop. But it scares me, because Poe tries to bite Mars. I don't know if it's actually aggression, or if he's trying to give him a warning (I don't think he's every actually bit down), or if he's trying to play and Mars doesn't understand.

Something I've tried doing is if I give one dog a treat, I give the other one as well, but idk if that's actually good. Sometimes they will both sit on my lap and they usually behave that way, but I usually am just petting Poe because I'm very anxious about giving Mars attention and having Poe react negatively. I also give them baths and clip their nails and brush them in the same sitting and switch between them and that usually goes okay.

I would appreciate any tips anyone can give me to help them not fight over me. My dad says when I'm at work they play together outside and I think they get along alright, but they do fight over me, and sometimes toys. Mars likes to steal Poe's toys, and Poe usually chases him to get them back but there's not usually aggression over the toys, although sometimes Poe will just sit and growl at Mars.

Another thing I should note is Mars is around 10-15 pounds, and Poe was 11 pounds when I brought him home. He's now roughly 20 and will get up to 50, so I do worry as he gets bigger he could do some actual damage to Mars.

234,dogs,"Kind of at the end of our rope and considering rehoming because we are overwhelmed and desperate for help.

We have two rescue dogs. C (4-5yo weimaraner mix) and P (4-5yo cattle dog mix??).
We adopted P in April from someone who was struggling with his escape attempts. And he adjusted really well and easily in our home. He only went pee and potty outside, not super obedient but followed our first dog quite well (who is more obedient and learns fast).

Ever since August, P has been almost exclusively pooping inside our house. I cannot tolerate it, we have a crawling baby and it's disgusting. We have a fenced yard, let the dogs out several times a day to run and go pee and potty. And yet he poops 5+ times a day inside. We have let them out 4 times today from 8am to 2pm and he has managed to poop 3 times inside already.

I put up baby gates so they can't come into the living area where our baby crawls around, and now he just poops what seems like every other hour inside. He doesn't poop outside most of the time when we let him out.
Today it's raining so he even peed inside.

I can't take it anymore. And he needs constant supervision outside because he's an escape artist. We spent $9k on a new 6ft fence and he still manages to climb over it and run away. Our living situation hasn't changed, the house hasn't changed, nothing has changed and he isn't sick.

Originally, I was going to adopt them about a month before school starts, so they could get used to me and feel safe before taking them to school with me.

He’s a very powerful chewer that likes to rip things and goes through any said long-lasting chew in minutes. I had no idea BCs were such strong chewers! Poor sheep lol

He’s not into those silicone or rubber bones, I guess even the flavoured ones are boring for him. And I’ve tried making toys out of cardboard, but they last maybe 3 nanoseconds. He adores actual bones, but the vet said they are bad for their teeth (when asked what he’d suggest instead, he said “silicone chews” 🙄. Vet is also against bully sticks, but I’m not entirely convinced here). 

Anytime I buy a toy with seemingly strong stitching (like this [one](https://www.amazon.ca/Chuckit-Large-Kick-Fetch-Ball/dp/B0084DRJKO/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=3MC51SAIBODDR&amp;keywords=chuck+it+balls+large&amp;qid=1671125854&amp;sprefix=chuck+it+ball%2Caps%2C232&amp;sr=8-1), RIP), Cookie proves me wrong. 

We do play together a lot, tugging and fetching etc., but I’d like him to have toys lying around to choose from and play alone when we can’t do it together. I have to hide all his toys bc none of them are safe for him to find and play without us watching.

We are taking a short 2 to 3 day trip to Mexico next week, Puerto Peñasco. I have never traveled with a dog before, not to mention never traveled out of the country with a dog. I will be traveling with my sister who is very good with dogs, but I am still here seeking advice. Any tips you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

I'm taking bottled water and his food. He has a travel hammock that he loves to ride in to the groomer and the vet. I'm taking his own food bowls and a rug that he likes to lay on normally. I just got him a new ""In Training"" vest to wear (he is approved for service dog training, classes start next year). Hopefully that will help if/when people try to interact. He's a very timid rescue Aussie. 

Mainly I just want to be able to avoid anything that might be traumatizing and not make any new owner mistakes that y'all could help me avoid. Any advice would be appreciated!

I'm taking paper copies of all his vaccination records.

251,dogs,"At the height of my depression, my parents got me a dog. My life instantly became so much better and I don’t know what I would have done without him. He really saved me.

However, I left for college in August and my mom gave him to a friend of a friend to take care of. Because of family reasons, they couldn’t take care of him for some time and the friend of the friend mentioned that I could go see him anytime. Their family is the lady, some other adults (maybe her siblings), and maybe 10 children in total, including a son my age (teenager or 20 years old).

Note this was not giving them ownership. And we were still paying for his insurance up until yesterday when it expired.

Well, in October, my mom lost all contact with this lady. The lady changed/cancelled her number. We have constantly asked the mutual friend, the friends in that circle, and even the veterinarian but no one can contact this lady. Those friends didn’t even know the lady in real life so that’s why they can’t contact her. And for the appointment that the lady brought to vet, she only left her phone number because everything else was from us. 

I know the lady has a son my age but my mom doesn’t know his name. If she did, I would probably be able to find him. I tried to search her name (both her English and non-English name) on social medias to no luck.

I wished to become friends with him prior to me leaving for college but I didn’t get to meet him. I only know that he cleaned their house really well when my mom went to introduce my dog to them (at a park) to make good impressions. My mom never went to their house though, so we don’t know where they live.

I’m thinking of waiting all day at the park that my mom met the family in because they would often meet up there before they lost contact. However, it’s getting really cold so I’m worried that they would not spend that much time in the park/even go to the park. Also the park is huge so I’m worried I would miss them.

I feel like the worst owner ever. I should have just stayed so that I could take care of my dog or something.

253,dogs,"Now let me start off by saying I do have some health anxiety and am not asking for med advice but rather the likely hood. 

Last night our dog had used the bathroom in the floor after refusing to use the bathroom outside because he was to busy being distracted by the neighbors cats. When he did this, I went to him and grabbed him by the collar to bring him to his mess and show him his wrong doing.

I stopped paddling him a few weeks ago and have since resorted to alternate forms or discipline (spending time in the kennel, not letting him sleep in the bed with us at night, etc) 

When I was dragging him by his collar, and brought him to his mess, he Instantly knew what was going on, I believe in fear that I was about to paddle him (like I would have normally have done previously, also it’s moderate swats on his behind, no closed fist or hard hits), he turned out and hit my hand. The bite is nothing crazy, just a small puncture wound on my thumb. 

I immediately went and washed it with soap and water. 

We’ve have had this dog for around 15 months and was supposedly up to date on all vaccinations when we got him. He hasn’t been showing any signs of illness or acting strangely. We always monitor him closely when outside as well.

255,dogs,"Hi all! 

My family has a vizsla dog. He's 5 and a half months old, has been living with us for 3 months and is pure love. That is until recently when his teeth have started to fall out and he has since been very nervous, aggressive when taking things he shouldn't, etc. He also can't seem to accept the crate. The most he has been in the crate is 50 minutes when someone is around but he can't be alone in the crate because he barks and wails and sound isolation in our apartment complex is poor. Does it get better when he replaces all the teeth? We know a woman who has a vizsla but was so aggressive that she got her a muzzle. When the vizsla was 7-something months old, she became far more tame. 

He's better than her, the dog trainer is satisfied with the progress, but right now, the lack of flexibility, having to watch him all the time, having to take things out of his mouth constantly and having nasty bruises and scratchmarks as a result makes the dog more of a chore than a companion. 

Will it get any better? Maybe when he's one year old? Is it short-term pain for long-term gain? Please share your opinions and ask questions if I left some important detail out or I haven't properly clarified something.

258,dogs,"I recently made the decision to have cataract surgery for my dog. At the time, I thought it was the right thing to do to improve her quality of life and help her see better. However, now that the surgery is over and we are in the midst of the aftercare, I'm starting to have second thoughts.

The aftercare for this type of surgery is intense. My dog has to wear a cone to prevent her from rubbing her eyes, and she has to be on a special eye drops regimen several times a day. It's a lot of work and can be stressful for both me and my dog.

Furthermore, I'm scared about the possibility of complications like glaucoma. Cataract surgery carries a risk of glaucoma, which can be difficult to treat and can lead to blindness. I'm constantly worried about my dog's eye health and it's causing me a lot of anxiety.

I'm not sure if I made the right decision in getting the surgery for my dog. While I want her to see better, I'm starting to regret putting her through all of this stress and potential complications. I just hope that everything turns out alright in the end.

They are ready to put her up for adoption over all the shedding, and they say if I can resolve it, she can stay. Now, I don't think we can even find her a new home since she is a huge dog at this point. When there are so many puppies available to adopt, it becomes pretty difficult to find her a loving home. Even then, it would break my heart to see her go. I love this dog very much. She is a very sweet, obedient, and intelligent dog that deserves the best. 

Now, back to the shedding part. For the brush I use, it's called the ""fur fetcher"", and I brush both down her fur and against it (she prefers when I brush against). I'm getting ready to give her a nice bath, and I'll admit this is my first time bathing her (since she isn't technically my dog, and I'm gradually taking more responsibility for her). I'm really hoping that will help remove some of her fur. I'll definitely give her a nice blow-dry, and I'm even considering vacuuming her with a special fur removing part that connects to the hose (she's a big dog and has thick skin, so this shouldn't hurt her)

It was only for a second but he seemed to pull really hard and the dog yelped in pain.

The ear is very red, no swelling that I can feel, and he doesn't like me examining it but he'll tolerate it. No blood, no lumps, no big heat difference between the ears that I can tell. He's curled up asleep beside me now and seems ok, but is there any way I can tell for sure? Or should I just bring him to the vet to be safe? This dog in particular often doesn't tell us if he's in pain unless it gets really really bad, hence why I might be overreacting to his initial yelp.

To clarify at the time of the accident the dog and toddler were completely supervised. I was two inches away and reacted immediately so there's no possibility of further injury that I wouldn't have seen / know about.",t2_plra7a44,0,How to check for ear injury in a dog?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zmopti,True,snoozy_sioux,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zmopti/how_to_check_for_ear_injury_in_a_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zmopti/how_to_check_for_ear_injury_in_a_dog/,2471585,1671120246,0,,False,1671120258,1671120259,2022-12-15 16:04:06,,,,,,,

He's a good boy, but was not socialized properly as a puppy. As a result he can be aggressive with other dogs - some dogs more than others. Thankfully he is great with people and gets a ton of human interaction.  

It would be nice for him to be able to socialize in the dog park or interact with other dogs while we're out walking.

273,dogs,"Me and my husband currently adopted our dog Daisy. We already have a rescue, and he’s the best little bean ever. A hound/pit mix, house trained, doesn’t chew, the perfect dog.

We got (Daisy, 4yo) our Pyrenees about a month ago, and it has been an absolute nightmare. She is a counter surfer, so for the first few days we tried to barricade her from the kitchen (didn’t work, she just jumped and knocked everything over).

We got a baby gate, so that solved that. No more kitchen access for Daisy. But this didn’t fix her extreme separation anxiety. She has scratched our door to smithereens. Eaten the blinds, or just anything paper related in her area. Can’t crate her, because she is gigantic and I feel like she would hurt herself if put in a crate.

It’s not like she doesn’t get exercise, we walk them 2-4 miles every night and they have unlimited backyard access. But this is an issue as well…

Daisy hates grass. Won’t walk in it, will stand there are refuse if on a leash. We have dirt in our backyard, so that’s where she will pee, but she just in general hates being outside. Which is hard, because she doesn’t play, so idk how to mentally stimulate her. 

She does not act like a pyr. She doesn’t bark, isn’t aloof, and food is her #1 motivator. She will knock anything and everything over during dinner time. Trying to get her to calm down when food is around is a monumental task.

Last night I cut my APBT (Moose) and GSD (Harper) nails. They reluctantly let me do it so it’s not too bad. Usually Chief (GSD) runs off to his bed and hides his feet - see below about him letting me hug him for the first time and some context. 

Recently when I’ve cut Moose and Harper’s nails, I’ve gone over to him and let him sniff the clippers. The last time I cut them I went over to Chief and just put the clippers around any front foot nail I could find, held it there, until he started squirming - maybe 5 seconds. 

Last night, there was no running. He sat there and watched. He came over and cleaned up the parts of the mail that I’d cut - gross. Next news he’s on the couch with his feet tucked under. I thought I’d try again with just putting the clippers around him nail. There was no squirming so I went for it. His face was pure shock. I let him eat the part I’d cut off and went for the next one. He let me clip it. Me thinking, bloody hell he’s letting me do it. Jinxed myself. 

I gave him some treats and some love. Although his face screamed, yeah you’re not doing that again, I’m so happy/proud of him for actually letting me cut them or at least two… 

*From a previous post about him*:
I found him (Chief, GSD) in the middle of the road about a year ago now. Me being me, I couldn’t just leave him and there was no way I was taking him to the pound. I brought him home to my other two dogs - male APBT and female GSD. I posted on social media, Craigslist etc. Nobody claimed him after a few days so I took him to the vet to see if there was a microchip. Nothing… 

They think he’s an outdoor dog based on his behavior and some health issues he has. He’s missing parts of his ears which they’ve put down to be chewed on by insects. It was difficult at first because he really didn’t know what to do. It seemed like he’d not had much human interaction or been inside at all/for an extended period of time. I set him up with a bed/safe space by the side of my bed. He just stayed there all night and has slept there ever since. 

He’s never really liked to be touched or to be petted for too long. I put a harness on him a while ago and he didn’t like that I wrapped my arms around him to put it on.

I take them out at least three times a day and even then, yesterday I took them to the patio and one of them still pooped on the sofa that's out there (I didn't notice until much later), the other day my sister forgot to close her door (they sleep in my room) and they went in and pooped and peed on her bed, this have also happened in my mom's bed and on the guess bedroom. They did it a couple of times in my bed but thankfully have stopped. They also pee their own bed on a weekly basis, so i gave up (I got tired of washing their bed every week) and just let them sleep with me, they also do this with carpets or if they find clothes or fabrics on the floor... The person who had them before us, worked all day and just let them by themselves all day in a room, i think maybe that's why they do this. 

There has been some improvement since they arrived, before they didn't even went potty when I took them outside but now they go fairly quickly and the male has even gone a couple of times outside by himself to pee, the female one doesn't leave my side so if I don't go with her she will just pee wherever I am.

289,dogs,"Apologies but just need some advice, my sister's dog (Vizsla, 3-3.5yr male) got a few good chunks out of me while playing (maybe too rough) on Thanksgiving.

I sort of watched this dog grow up (as an uncle, sister's kids, bro in law etc), we were always pretty chill and he'd even sleep on me.

Fast forward 3-4 years to this Thanksgiving, introducing a second Vizsla, his sister (same litter, she almost a year now), and with all the kids they both get pretty riled up.

So myself, the 3 kids, we're all playing with the male dog, tossing toys, pushing, jumping on (not me), etc.... Just a lot of excitement. He seemed happy, everything good.

Incident happened quickly, he had a toy in his mouth, I tried to grab him by the butt and spin him around while trying to get the toy... (I've done this before, never doing it again to any dog).

Bad idea. Two deep bites on my right arm and a third on my left, chomp chomp chomp.


So yea ... It's been 21 days and went through two different (and stronger) antibiotics, been using triple antibiotic ointment 24/7, anti itch cream... but it still looks terrible. Hurts, incredibly itchy, Red.

I've got a 6 month puppy that was doing great going potty only on walks. He would occasionally go inside when I wasn't home, but it'd be more my fault for being gone too long. 

Suddenly, he started occasionally saving his poop for when he got back inside from his walk. I'm not sure why he started doing this. I've even extended walks to try to get him to go, stood over the same patch of grass for 10 minute, rewarding with training treats and pets when he does go, but he goes when he gets inside for some reason. 

Also, curious to if anyone knows why when I gate him in my room with me, he goes from hyper and rambunctious to sleeping. He can be super hyper and playful, but the second the gate is up, he just goes and lays down to sleep. I can't get him to chew his bone or anything else.

Do I need to go to the vet or are there some home remedies I can do.

My first thought was sunburn as she spends a lot of time outside when I’m at work. And outside on the weekends when we go to the park and what not.

It’s very hot where I live in Australia and it’s summer here so sunburn was my first guess but you guys let me know.

Just focus on the bridge of her nose that part on top of that is always pink :)

The management team has been investigating this and has a camera set up where they've caught the suspect wearing a hoodie lighting a firework in an open parking garage that is on the 5th level of this apartment complex. But his face is obscured. The front desk staff will sometimes go up to the 5th floor garage and hide out to see if this man will come out. There has been no luck. This past week, I was taking my dog on a walk outside and while I was walking into the building, this man set off 2 fireworks. It scared me so much, even my hear stopped for a second it was SO loud, and my dog freaked out. The following day and into the night, my dog refused to eat, play, or even sleep. She was shivering and panting out of fear. She refuses to go near any window and just lies down in the bathroom. Today, I got some steak and some snacks to entice her to eat and she nibbled on a little. It's been two days and she's still panting all day and night and will not settle down. When I take her outside to potty, she now lies down and refuses to move. She's shivering and shaking the whole time. She's peed inside the elevator because she's too afraid to pee outside. She's never done any of these things before. She's always been the most outgoing, confident pup. I've been training her with the help of professionals since she was a baby and she knows how to heel, her recall is great, her engagement is great, etc. We would go for 2 hour walks each day in total. I've tried carrying her a bit far away from the area to see if she'd walk but she's still shivering and if she gets the hint that we're going back home, she will stop and refuse to move. Can anybody give me any advice on how to help her feel better / rehabilitate her? There is always a chance that this man will light these fireworks at any time and I can't plan for it except that he typically does it after dark. I'm worried and sad for my pup who is so deathly afraid. Should I board her for a few days so she can get away and maybe forget? I am at a loss for what to do. This is my first dog.

299,dogs,Ever since my dog was bought as a puppy she has been very aggressive. She has her own little space and if you get near it or stick your hand in it or sometimes even if you just call her she gets very aggressive and starts getting ready to bite. Shes bitten me and my family on multiple occasions and almost bit my brother through his hand. And  sometimes she’ll steal stuff and if you get within 5 feet of her she’ll start biting your ankles. Or she’ll bite up a shoe or eat something she shouldn’t have and you confront her about it she’ll get aggressive. Luckily she’s a small welsh terrier so she can’t do too much damage but she’s causing so many problems that I’m worried. She’s already 4 years old and I don’t want to put her down.

I gave her a double dose of her medicine and a few syringes of sugar water. She wouldn’t stay on her feet and her gums were so pale they were almost white. 

My husband, my sweet girl’s favorite person, is in another state right now. I went across the street to my neighbor’s house with a baby in one him and my girl in my arms. I don’t know if it was the cold air or the sugar water, but she barked at his dog before he could bark at her. 

My vet called me back after that. She told me to keep an eye on her -like I could sleep now- and to bring her in tomorrow. Thankfully, I have a few good neighbors that can take me tomorrow. 

So here I am on the couch, trying not to cry, with my girl laying on my chest and my son asleep beside me. But this is Addison’s.

302,dogs,"So my neighbors have two dogs. One of them is a terrier like the Target dog and the other dog is a little brown puppy that looks to be a mixed breed. They are clearly doing favoritism because the terroir gets the special treatment while the mixed one doesn’t such as getting the privilege to go inside the house. Fast forward a few months later I haven’t seen the brown dog in weeks maybe over a month. One day I hear puppy noises and turns out she had puppies. I was worried because of the lack of my neighbors presence in their house to help care for the puppies. 

Anyways, I go for a training out of town for about a month and a half and come back home and the puppies are bigger and running around. But I don’t see momma dog, later this week I come home from work and see her practically skin and bone walking in the street. I was mortified and immediately got some soft dog food for her to eat. I don’t know how skinny dogs get when nursing their dogs, I apologize if my thoughts automatically assumed she was skinny from all the nursing she did for her pups. Later today the front door neighbor told me the people on that house actually moved away and are moving slowly. Turns out they took the terrier and puppies were rehomed somewhere else and they just straight up abandoned the poor dog there. The whole block has been feeding her and giving her food to eat but she’s still extremely skinny. I want to call the cops on them for animal cruelty but I know if I do that they will take the dog to the pound and put her down since my city has too many dogs that aren’t getting adopted. Now this will kill me because I want to keep her but I already have four dogs that were all previously rescued from the street so I have no more room to pay for another.

When I went to customer service, they kept urging me to do a hard reset and asked me if I was the only one with access to my account (i am and my furbo account has 2 step verification and is linked to an email that is only used for furbo).

 They never warned me that someone was streaming from my account until I asked them directly and they said it may very well be the case.

307,dogs,"Long story short my husband and I have a 7 month old large breed puppy who we have put a ton of work into training (using methods we learned at a great training school, research and practice). Due to unforeseen circumstances we’ve had to move in with our in-laws for at least a few months. The issue is that the FIL completely disregards our method of training and yells &amp; pins the dog. I.e when the dog barks, jumps, plays too hard. Our dog is pretty well behaved so it probably happens once a day max. I can tell our dog is afraid of him and he almost brags about it. He’s made it very clear he believes in the old fashion training methods (dominance, alpha male etc).

We have asked multiple times not to do this and explained the theories behind our training but our training methods take patience. We have tried to explain that scaring the dog can eventually cause a dog to be reactive etc. and how we want to build trust not fear with our dog. It’s extremely important to us to have a well trained &amp; trusted dog since he’s going to be so big. 

There really is no way for us to keep the dog away from them and at this point I can’t seem to convince FIL to stop either. 

I’m really afraid he’s undoing a lot of our hard work and creating a non trusting dog which is my worst fear.

I was still on the phone and I got so confused cuz dogs never come running to me on the street to get petted  unlike other people who just attract animals. 

I shooed them away and got up and went to another place to sit. They did not follow me around, but now I am realizing that maybe they came to calm me down because I was crying I guess. 

Nothing about my life has changed right now, but I just want to love and pet those dogs and thank them for their lovely gesture. I do get scared of street dogs cuz I am scared of getting bitten by a rabid dog, but if I see one wagging it's tail, I am never going to shoo it away from now.

317,dogs,"So, some background: I adopted a senior (7 years old) dog a little over a year ago. At the time, he was very overweight and didn't have a ton of energy, so I didn't think much of the fact that he didn't like to play with toys. I simply figured he just didn't have the energy for it. 

Fast forward a year, he's at a healthy weight but still doesn't seem interested in playing with toys or me. I've tried getting him interested in tug of War and fetch - both no-gos. He's not interested in playing with toys unless there are treats/food involved.

Pretty much the only toys he'll play with are toys that you can hide treats in or toys he can chew on. He's extremely food-motivated. 

However, I can't just feed him treats all day and he doesnt even use the chew toys that often. 

Lately, it feels as if he's ""bored."" He'll bark for attention or just get antsy, even after we've gone on our daily walks. Since he doesn't seem interested in most toys or playing with me, I'm not sure how to stimulate him. As I said, I can't constantly use puzzle toys/toys with treats as it's just not healthy for him.

Below is the post copied from the other subreddit. We also checked ""the dog cancer survival guide"" from the library if anyone has used it before. I'd appreciate any advice or any experiences anyone can share with us. Thank you in advance.

""Hello, we have an 8 year old spayed (as a puppy) french bulldog who had surgery last week to excise a lump in her abdomen. Turns out it's solid type mammary carcinoma with a mitotic score of over 30 so super aggressive. We don't have a follow up with our regular vet until Monday, and we don't see the vet oncologist until January. As far as we understand, with the surgery complete and no visible spread to the surrounding tissues or lymph, the next steps would be x-ray to determine spreading (if any), supportive care, and possibly chemo and/or radiation.

With just some brief reading we think we should change her diet to something lower in carb and higher in fat/protein. Any recommended food brands/formulations out there we should try? She has eaten wellness grain free basically her entire life and has a mild sensitivity to rice. 

I'm a skilled cook and also proficient with canning (including meats) and would be comfortable making her food at home if I knew what I was doing. I've never tried to make her food before except in the cases of tummy upsets where I make her chicken and sweet potato. I know that they need a lot of variety and also probably supplements in their diet if going the homemade route so if anyone has any info on brands of food to try or a reliable source of info for homemade food, we would appreciate it.

321,dogs,"I have a 75 lb lab hound mix.  In the last year or so she started getting a wort near her eyelid.  It started looking bigger so I looked through old photos and it indeed looks like it has gotten bigger.  It doesn't seem to bother her, however it is kind of in her line of sight especially if she is looking down.  I felt bad today because she hit her chin on the front porch chair after turning around and there is a chance this is because she didn't see the chair because of the wort.  

I think it makes sense to get it removed, and it would be done by the vet slicing it off.  This got me thinking.  I have a rather large mole right on my neck above my collar bone and it is something I have been insecure and protective of since I was a young child.  I have seen a dermatologist about it multiple times and it's fine.   It's hard to imagine life without it kind of.  However, getting it removed is one of my biggest fears.  I cringe thinking about it.

Is it hypocritical to remove my dog's wort if I am personally afraid of removing my mole?  I thought about going into battle with my dog together, she gets her wort removed and I get my mole removed - but I can't bring myself to do it.  I sincerely feel like I am power tripping by doing something for my dog that I am afraid to do to myself.  It's probably for the best for her, but she too is pretty fearful of being left alone at the vet and being anesthetized.

323,dogs,"So....for context, my family has two huskies. One is a 9 year old male named Jericho and the other is a 6 year old female named Zairee.  Originally they were supposed to be my stepdad's dogs but they grew attached to my mom lol. Whenever she leaves the house for hours then returns, they'll greet her with pounces, whining, licking, etc cause they missed her so much.

I, meanwhile (the daughter), am pretty homebound so I'm around the dogs nearly 24/7. I'm typically doing my own thing and leaving them be. Feed them when they need to be fed.

Yet for some reason I find that Jericho, immediately after my mom leaves in the morning, just gravitates to my room. He'll stand next to the bed and maybe bark once or twice (while I'm trying to sleep). Just stays there. Sometimes he's tried to hop onto my bed (a twin, to clarify haha) but I get him off. Eventually he'll stop and then just lay on the ground directly next to my bed.

He'll just lay there next to my bed almost all day too. He gets up if he has to go to the bathroom, get some water, or eat but otherwise he's just glued there and I'm just puzzled.

Am I supposed to be some substitute mommy for him or something? Or is it that because I'm the only person in the house while my parents are at work he's clinging to me?

325,dogs," 

My dog is of a breed well-known to have allergies of all sorts. In the first few months of dealing with his issues, we focused on topical relief, such as medicated shampoo's, and prescription ear drops. My vet kept recommending a food trial when I got the time, so we finally started and he has been on hydrolyzed protein food for 2-3 weeks now. Since he started HA, he has essentially been throwing up after every meal. We waited it out to see if he would adjust to the food, but nothing has changed. He has lost so much weight, and is visibly less energetic as he usually is.

I cannot find ONE review or story online of a dog that has had a similar/bad reaction to this hydrolyzed protein Purina veterinary diet. It is strange to me because I am for certain it is the food that is causing him to react this way, but I see nothing but positive things about HA, or posts that it is very unlikely to cause inflammatory reactions. My dog has never had this problem before, and his prior food was not giving him these problems.

Please, if this has happened to you, or you know of anyone who has had a bad experience with hydrolyzed protein diet, please let me know. How did you deal with it, and what food have you used that has helped your dog recover? I am so worried about my baby, and I have already spent thousands on him in less than a year just trying to help him, but I am currently a student living off of student loans, so a $300-$500 vet visit every so often is just not sustainable.

326,dogs,"My partner and I got a rescue a couple months ago. She is now almost 8 months old and—to be frank—reeks. I’m very sensitive to smell but we both fell in love with her. 

I just didn’t anticipate this level of stink. It’s like stale corn chips had a baby with moldy cheese in a homeless person’s butthole. The vet gave her a clean bill of health and recommended we only bathe her every 3-4 weeks, which we do with Buddy Wash shampoo.

I have tried several brands of anti-odor dog wipes, dry/waterless shampoo, doggy “deodorant” spray (including one with probiotics for any yeast issues), and even plain old baking soda. I only test products out once a week to monitor sensitivity and avoid messing with her natural oils, etc.

She has no issues with them but they just don’t work! Not to mention that she’s already 40 pounds (a surprise to us) and growing every day, so she stinks up the whole 1-bedroom apartment. I find myself doing laundry 3x a week to deodorize any surface she sits on. I sprinkle baking soda on everything and keep Febreze in each room. I brush her teeth and her coat regularly, as well.

My partner insists she just smells like dog and this is normal, but lately her smell makes me nauseous. The couch absorbs her odor quickly and I avoid sitting on it because it makes my stomach turn. I find myself wanting to be around her less and less despite enjoying her presence in general.

333,dogs,"Our sweet boy, a 2-year-old greyhound, isn't so fond of being alone.  He's come a long way in the 6 months we've had him though (the key was giving him free rein over the house while we're at work, rather than crating him), and really doesn't have any issues with being alone up to 8 hours at this point.  He literally just sleeps on the sofa the entire day (we have the puppycam footage to prove it).

However, he has an odd habit.  It started one day when we came home from work and were surprised to find one of my wife's shoes on the sofa.  He had apparently carried it over from the door that we leave from and brought it to the sofa where he sleeps all day while we're gone.  It wasn't chewed or anything.  The same thing happened a couple times, so we started putting our shoes away.

But then he started doing this with other objects.  One time it was a padded lunchbox from the counter, then a sock that had been left on a chair, and most recently *a large tin can that was drying on the counter*.  He doesn't chew these things, but just brings them over to the sofa and then sits next to them.  It only happens when we leave him alone (otherwise he only ever plays with his toys), and he does it as soon as we leave.

Just now my wife went out to dinner and I was sitting on his favorite sofa in the living room.  He followed her to the door, and to my surprise, came running back over to me with my shoe in his mouth!  He placed it right next to me on the sofa and stared at me, like he had forgotten I was here to witness him in the act.  Here is the scene: https://i.imgur.com/6YDZc0e.jpg

2 weeks ago I took her to the vet and he said that when she finishes her current bag of food, to switch her to adult food. I say we have about a week left before we need a new bag of food. 

In my opinion, it seems kind of early to be switching from puppy to adult food. I have never had a puppy before (only adult dogs) so I want to make sure I am doing everything right.

Basically I want a dog like my collie, but with a BIT less drive and more easy going.

My collie does have a great off switch despite his insane energy.  Isn’t destructive whatsoever, regardless if he doesn’t get a walk for a few days.  Pretty social with dogs, people and strangers.  Perfect off leash obedience/recall since 6 months old around any distraction.  

He’s fetch/toy obsessed which is why training was so easy.  Basically I want a dog exactly like my collie but a bit more laid back, more of an  independent thinker, meaning they will stop when tired unlike my dog who will go until he dies.

I don’t want a lazy dog, just a slightly laid back version of my collie with similar trainability.

GSD and Doberman probably suits it best but sometimes they can be super high drive as well so I’m leaning towards a rottie.  Recall is important since I take my dog off leash anywhere I want since his recall has been rock solid since he was 6 months.  

I hear rotties are more goofy and more welcoming of strangers.  Taking the dog to public places like the gym, patios, indoor dog friendly places, big social gatherings, etc is important to me.

We're planning on going to my SIL's for Christmas, and she said we could bring the dog with us. All she's asked is that we keep the dog downstairs, which is fine. Her downstairs is like an apartment (previous owner had set it up for his wife, who was ill) -- there's a bedroom, living area, bathroom, etc. There's even a kitchen, which she uses for a craft room.

We're planning on bringing the dog's crate, and my husband and I will likely sleep downstairs so she'll have familiar company. I'm sure there will be times she's alone, but we'll take her for walks as usual and spend time with her. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on things we can do to make this easier on the dog and/or us? She'll ride in the back seat of the car (we have a seatbelt harness).

365,dogs,"I have an approximately 11 year old, 60lb female lab mix that we adopted when she was about 1 year old. She was previously stray and came to is through a rescue organization. She's been a wonderful member of our family and we've been through a lot together. She has adapted incredible well to her 2 little (human) brothers. She has always been incrdibly healthy and playful. In September of this year, I let her out in the backyard in the morning like always, and about 15 minutes later when I whistled for her to come in, she didn't, which was unusual. I went out to find her standing in the yard with her left hind leg in the air unable to bear weight, and in obvious pain. A couple days later, we had the diagnosis of CCL rupture. It was so hard to see her in that state and we immediately signed her up for surgery. Over the next few days however, her pain lessened significantly, and I spent a lot of time researching conservative management. I pushed the surgery back 10 days and she continued to improve. I made a commitment to helping her recover conservatively and we cancelled the surgery altogether. The next couple months were tough but she was making great progress. She was starting to be playful again and getting around really well. We were settling into a new routine when the unthinkable happened. 3 days ago, she got too excited in the house and slipped and fell awkwardly. She was yelping in pain and it was immediately clear she had hurt her right forelimb. She was suddenly unable to bear any weight on it. It was about 9 pm and I was distraught. We use a mobile vet because of her terrible vet anxiety and I did not want to subject her to an emergency visit elsewhere if I could help it. I got her out to potty, which amazingly she was able to do, got her some Galliprant and gabapentin, and she was comfortable enough to get to sleep. I called our vet as soon as they opened but unfortunately they were booked until the 23rd of December! I frantically started looking at other options and got a recommendation from a friend and their vet was able to work us in tomorrow.

Curently, she seems to have no use of the right forelimb. It looks neurologic as she will let me prod and poke all over without reaction, but when she gets up (with help) she's unable to use it at all. I feel completely devastated for her. Almost 3 months of hard work getting her rear leg back to about 50% and now this. I'm currently carrying her out 3-4 times/day and she's able to go potty and move around gingerly, tripoding with really only 2 healthy legs. It's heartbreaking to watch. I'm second guessing our decisions and feel a little lost right now. I'm terrified that she may have a nerve injury with uncertain prognosis, complicated by her recent CCL injury. I'm completely committed to doing everything in my power to support her. I am hoping beyond hope that we could some reassuring news at the new vet tomorrow and I'm just wracked with anxiety over the whole situation.

366,dogs,"This my first time posting on Reddit ando English is not my native language so I apologize in avance for any mistake.

To keep this short My female syberian Husky got something of a flu and the veterinary gave her Prednisona. Two day later My wifi and I started noticing that she was drinking way more water and was urinating a lot more, Even so, she was urinating inside our house which she doesnt do as she is trained to do it outside. We suspended the prednisone and took her to the ver again. She took a blood sample for análisis and the resulta showed slightly elevated hepatic enzymes ( ALT and AST) and elevated ureic nitrogen.

The vet recommended a liver and kidney ultrasound. On the comment of the doctor who performed the ultrasound he wrote signs of SUB ACUTE HEPATOPATHY and we also noticed that the size of her kidneys is 0.2 to 0.4 cm below normal size For dogs of her size.

We tried googling what SUB ACUTE HEPATOPATHY was and what it meant for our dog but Google hasnt been of mucho help and we would also like to understand what having small kidneys (RENAL HYPOPLASIA) means For our dog. 

For context, our dog has always been energetic, we took her everyday For a walk, she always eats solid dog food mixed with chiflen breast which we cook by boiling it and we don't add salt to it. We have always considered our dog to be a healthy one and if she hadnt got the flu we would have never know about the Hypoplasia.

374,dogs,Our dog had a larger than expected litter of 11 puppies (we were told four on the scan). Since hitting six weeks of age they all seem to whine constantly even when they’ve been fed and we’ve given them attention etc. They have a big outside area to run around in yet they stay at the fence whining and trying to climb out (even when we’re with them) so I bring them inside to their indoor pen and they just do the same thing. Some days they’ll whine for up to four hours solid. They sleep on a bed in crates and even when in the crates with the door shut they’ll keep whining. Mum still feeds them occasionally but they’ve cut her teats so she’s staying away from them.

375,dogs,"My husband and I are looking for advice on what to do with our dog. Please no hateful comments. We understand the role we’ve played in his life; good and bad. 

We have a 5 1/2 old Lab Retriever mix. I adopted him when he was 11 weeks old. At that time we lived in an apartment in Colorado. The first two years of his life were an extreme challenge and we did not always do the best we could for his training and development. He has gone through a puppy training class; he completed a six week course to learn basic commands. He is very treat oriented so we found the right way to keep instilling his training at home (he is still excellent at those commands). He is the best cuddler and gives hugs with his big paws. There is no short of loving coming from that doggo. He is however anxious around strangers and often barks at any sounds he hears that are not in the house. For punishing bad behavior we tried a water bottle, timeouts, reinforcement of good behavior with treats. We have never put our hands on him with closed fists, but he has received smacks on his rear and nose. His response to his punishments have always been aggressive. He snarls, bares his teeth, and he has attempted to bite us several times. We manage by guiding him to his kennel by his collar. We’ve kept persevering and work everyday to be better because we took him on as ours and he deserves to have an amazing life. We try so hard to give it to him.

However, things really started to change and get unmanageable when we had our son in April of 2021. For the first few weeks after we brought him home the dog seemed really interested. He greeted him and licked him and was really gentle. By the time our son was 4-6 months and was really exploring his environment and toys, the dog was completely anxious. He didn’t like the noisy toys and didn’t like the attention being given to the baby. To this day, he has struggled with the kid being in our lives. Our son is 20 months now. We cannot play in his room without the dog rushing to come bark in our faces. He jumps over the baby gates when we put them up and scratches at the bedroom door when we close it to play. Now there have been so cute moments as well, and he does seem very protective of him. But the bad is outweighing the good. There have been moments where the dog has attempted to bite him; his face, his hands, his feet. Just this morning he responded aggressively to my son and I found a mark where his teeth had pierced skin. And I will say we work hard everyday to make sure our toddler is respectful of the dog’s boundaries and to always be “soft”, but at his current age, this is still a challenge. 

I feel like these behaviors are red flags and he’s trying to warn us of potentially more serious reactions. I would feel so guilty if he does end up seriously harming my son and I did nothing to stop or prevent it. Now I also want to find the solution that’s best for everyone, we freaking love our dog with all our hearts; we signed up to be his forever home. But at what point are we pulling the wool over our eyes to keep him? At what point do we decide that we aren’t giving him his best life?

When I think of it..it seems like there are only a few options left. (there are obviously pros and cons to each of these options) 

1. keep him
2. Rehome him
3. Surrender him to a shelter
4. Choose to euthanize 

We are just trying to make the best decision we can for every member of our family; us, kiddo, and doggo. At this point, I am asking for any advice, any suggestions, any personal stories that might have some guidance about what our next step is.",t2_tohpp3xo,0,Help us help our fur baby in the best way for everyone.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zm0nd4,True,AriVeryBerry,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zm0nd4/help_us_help_our_fur_baby_in_the_best_way_for/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zm0nd4/help_us_help_our_fur_baby_in_the_best_way_for/,2471316,1671048070,0,,False,1671048082,1671048083,2022-12-14 20:01:10,,,,,,,
376,dogs,"Hello! I am getting my own apartment soon and have been wanting a dog for years and now is finally the time where I can do it. I plan on getting a dog from a local shelter because I want an adult dog and would love to give a rescue pup a good home. All but one of my family dogs were rescues but never from a shelter so that will be new. 

I am looking less for breed recommendations and more of key things to tell the rescue to help match me with a dog that is right for me. Also helpful would be any breeds to actively avoid. 

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog that I am fully responsible for. I grew up with family dogs. A cocker spaniel and then 3 rescues from the side if the road. Not a lot of experience with formal training. 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a breeder?

 I love the idea of rescuing and I'd rather start with an adult dog rather than a puppy. 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

A dog that can go for walks, hikes and maybe the occasional jog. An apartment and camping companion. A dog that can be left alone some while at work. Basically some kind of balance between calm inside time and fun, active outside time.

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

 No specific breed desires. I cannot have anything restricted by the average US apartment complex (see list at #22).

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basics like sit, lay down, recall. I plan on enrolling in some type of dog training. 

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

  Nope

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    I work 4 days a week starting quite early in the morning so I have my afternoons wide open and would love to go on a long walk every day (I already go on walks or jogs most days by myself). I could also do a few hours of training and playing each week, especially on my off days. 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    I walk or jog for at least an hour outside almost every day and would bring the dog along then. Plus a pre-work morning walk (but that one will be much shorter). And then multiple bathroom outings since I live in an apartment. I jog some so it would be cool to have a dog that could jog with me but it's more important for me to have a dog that doesn't bounce off the walls of the apartment than one that jogs with me. I also like hiking so a dog with some stamina would be good. 

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    I don't have much experience with long hair since my cocker spaniel passed when I was young. I more used to short hair dogs and their shedding. But I would be willing to pay for grooming for a long haired dog of that was the right fit for me. I'm quite used to regular brushing of short hair dogs. 

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    No preference really. Big enough to handle to be able to have the stamina to hike and jog.  And nothing crazy big since I'm not a very big person and want to be able to carry my dog in an emergency.

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    Shedding is fine. I lived with 3 cats for a while and learned to cope just fine. Barking would be an issue in an apartment. Slobber is not ideal but could be tolerated.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

   Not very important. I intend to always have my dog leashed in parks since those are the local rules and it would make me feel more secure about interactions with other dogs. The dog would mostly spend time indoors, outside on a leash and fenced areas.

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    I love snuggles but I also enjoy getting to have my hands and lap free sometimes.

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

   Somewhere in the middle? 
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    Ideally the less barking the better since I live in an apartment. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

  Not really. I mean I only want one dog so it could be isolated if necessary. But also I'm hoping the dog could get along with my parents' dog so it could stay with them if I had to go out of town. Also I want to be able to walk in parks around other dogs.

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    I think barking in the apartment will be a big obstacle. Also chewing on things that aren't toys. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    I work 4 days a week. 2 days are close to home where I can pop over during my lunch break (I live really close). The other 2 days I commute further and can be gone for up to 10 hours. I'm willing to hire a dog walker for those days and occasionally take advantage of my retired parents.

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    I live alone. I have a friend in the same apartment complex who can check in on the dog if needed. 

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    No other pets and none other planned 

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    Probably not

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    Per apartment: No pitbulls, staffordshire terriers, American bulldogs, German Shepards, Akitas, Boxers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Mastiffs, Malamutes, Cane Corso, Huskies, Chow Chows and Wolf Hybrids.

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    Austin, TX- can't find any info about if any breeds are banned here 

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    Summers are hot, usually 90-100°F. I limit my time outside midday to avoid the heat. Winters are usually mild, not dipping below freezing much. 


Based on this info, are there any key words or specific needs I should communicate with the shelters when getting matched with a dog? I will probably end up telling them all of the above information but anything else I should share with them to get the best fit?

381,dogs,"My doggos got a hair cut today and I noticed this when we got home on Cider (8yr old male goldendoodle). If I recall correctly, there was a little bump there before, the last time he got shaved which was in the summer (and maybe even before that) but as his fur grew out it became hidden.  

It has definitely grown from what it was. I’m wanting to say it was kind of wart sized before but I’m not 100% on that. I have my finger for reference in the second picture below. 

The lump is in between hard and soft. It doesn’t squish like a fatty deposit, but it has a little bit of give to it. It doesn’t appear to hurt or be painful to the touch either. I have been messing with it and prodding it for a little bit and have only gotten like one or two disapproving grumbles from Cider (and he lets you know when he doesn’t like something). 

I wouldn’t say his behavior has changed these past few months, and there are no other symptoms I have noticed. He does spit up a lot more (just like a baby… it will literally just be a sip of water and a couple pieces of kibble that comes back up) than he used to. So I guess that would be a symptom? He’s always had a more sensitive stomach though so I haven’t thought much of it. 

My biggest question is does this require urgent vet attention? Is it likely to be cancerous or just a benign skin tag? 
I plan on doing my own research too, but I figured I would ask if anyone else has any knowledge they can spare.

382,dogs,"SOS - I need your advice... I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years. We got a dog together a little over 2 years ago, whom I love to death. Now my boyfriend has told me he has now learned that he doesn't like dogs that much and doesn't want to keep him anymore, and I feel really lost and I don't know what to do. I'm incredibly sad, because I've come to love the dog so much over the time we have had him. We got him when he was only 8 weeks old and I am his momma. He is a total velcro dog and has recently developed seperation anxiety because I have been abroad from him for 4 weeks now traveling to family after covid, and he has been taking care of the dog meanwhile.
I don't know what to do. What would you do? Tell him you are keeping the dog anyways because you made a commitment when getting the dog, or do as he wants and re-home the dog?

383,dogs,"Hello everyone, have any of you got some info on recovery from a splenectomy? 

My dog is almost 15, he has a mass on his spleen, for all we know it’s not cancerous, he’s had a ultrasound and it doesn’t look like the cancer has metastasized if it is cancerous. 

That said, we have a consultation for a splenectomy tomorrow morning and possibly a surgery tomorrow afternoon if we decide to move forward. 

I’m conflicted because I’m told that it’s a pretty routine procedure, that even old dogs can recover from it pretty easily. But he’s in great shape so he’s pretty lean, and every time he goes on antibiotics or has to take meds it’s hard to feed him. I’m worried he’ll lose too much weight while recovering. He’s not food motivated, never has been, so I wonder how long you guys (if anyone has had the experience) found that it took your dog to essentially be back to normal after this procedure?

She is being followed for GI issues that started in November. Her stools have changed dramatically after finally getting her to 1 can twice daily and off the turkey and rice completely. They are basically large piles of extremely mushy, rubbery yellow stool, even thick liquid at times, and she is having at least 3 a day. When we started the food ( started at 1/4 can combined with turkey and rice) her stools were soft but formed enough to pick up. She does have a very low B-12 level and started B-12 injections last week, will receive weekly x4 with a recheck of levels after that. I spoke with the vet's office yesterday about the stool consistency and they recommended 1/8 teaspoon psyllium ( i.e. plain metamucil) daily to help bulk things up. She had a dose last evening and this morning, probably too soon to tell a difference. She also started Visbiome probiotic on 12/7. At any rate, my question is whether anyone has experienced these horrific stools even when doing a slow transition to this diet? Or could the Visbiome be the culprit?

386,dogs,"We have been fostering what appears to be a rat terrier mix for a few weeks. He is between 1 and 3, although we think he’s closer to 1. We are thinking about adopting him ourselves but are hesitant because of some behaviors. 

We have fostered before and know adult dogs can have behavioral issues but we are concerned about how much he could improve and what is realistic. We live in a townhouse so excessive barking is an issue. 

He sleeps in the crate at night wonderfully and during the day if we need to be on a work call. If he is out of the crate he struggles to settle and barks at us for attention. We aren’t sure if it’s a lack of exercise, or if he’s overtired, or just nervous. He gets frozen kongs in the crate and eats his food out of puzzle toys. He gets 2x 30 min walks and 3x 5 min walks to use the bathroom. 

But when he wants something (food or to go outside when he’s already eaten or just been out) he barks a lot at us. We can’t sit on the couch without him barking. We ignore him and he stops after a few minutes but starts back up again because he doesn’t know what to do with himself. He can be coaxed to nap on the couch but needs a lot of petting but when he does he will sleep for a few hours. He also gets in bed with me in the morning (after my husband lets him out to pee) and sleeps for an additional 1.5 hours. 

The only times he’s “settled” are in the crate, on the couch under a blanket, or in the bed with me. Any other time he paces around the house or barks at us. Sometimes he is able to sit and chew an empty kong without coaxing or attention. 

Does this seem like over or under stimulation, or just a bad habit? The other training like barking on the leash and minor dog things seem manageable. There’s a great facility near us that does an 8 week group manners course that we would want to take him to. But inside the home we are having trouble rewarding good behaviors like settling down, because he gets excited if he gets a treat and starts barking again.

I have an 11 year old mini schnauzer/ dachshund mix who was diagnosed earlier this year with diabetes. The vet said it is nothing we did wrong as she is in great shape, good weight, 13 pounds and it's all genetics. We noticed she was drinking a lot of water and started having accidents in the house and thought maybe she had a uti but she was acting more sluggish then usual. After blood tests she was diagnosed with diabetes and we finally have her insulin levels correct. However it seems the disease is still winning as she has gone blind seemingly overnight. I read it can happen. She is also having accidents in the house again because of the sudden lack of vision, so all of us in the house are taking turns taking her outside to potty. (We have a dog door so she could do it herself at anytime she pleases before) Sometimes she gets a little confused so we try to help her with sound direction. What else can we do to make her comfortable? What can we do to make her life easy? Also everything I have read said I will probably lose her soon is that true? I would really just like some advice and stories on how you helped your diabetic babies. I want to give her the very best life I can with the time she has left. Thank you.

398,dogs,"Hi everyone! 

I apologize in advance for how repetitive I'm sure this post is. But I really need help choosing the right dog breed and would appreciate the insight from any owners, especially of the breeds I'm thinking about. 

The breeds I love are, of course, all the highest energy herding breeds. I have done a ridiculous amount of research on dog breeds. 

I preferably want a mixed breed / rescue dog, and have specifically been looking at border/heeler mixes as well as border/lab, mixes. However, I want to respect the breed for what it is and make sure I know exactly what I would be walking into. 

**Reasoning/Wants**: 

* I absolutely adore highly intelligent but also \*well behaved\* dogs. I would love to have a dog that I can bring on hikes and exploring in general. I am also pretty interested in dog sports / agility / training and could see myself wanting to do that with my pet
* I don't just want a ""pet"" I want my dog to feel like my partner 
*  I totally love all dogs, but I have never been drawn to overly dopey / friendly dogs like purebred labs or hounds. 
* I want a dog I can get really into training with. A dog that will be fiercely loyal to me and my boyfriend. I don't need a dog that is obsessed with every single person they meet / overly dopey and friendly
* Prefer to have a healthy breed / mixed breed 
* This is shallow - but I think herding dogs are just soooooo cute appearance wise and are in general, beautiful, amazing animals.

**About Me/Us:**

* We are a 25 y/o and 29 y/o couple
* Personality wise, I am an assertive but affectionate person. I enjoy being in control, confident, and training animals in general.
* Live in a suburban / semi rural area 
* We are renting a 1300 sq ft house with a partially fenced in yard (about 0.60 acres) most likely will be buying a home this year (looking at slightly bigger houses, with similar yard sizes)
* We have two male cats who we ADORE. They are very friendly and love people, and are with us pretty much all the time when we are home, sleep in our bed, etc. We give them a ton of attention throughout the day.
* Boyfriend works from home full time, M-F and can take breaks pretty much whenever he wants as long as he doesn't have meetings, so he could for sure let the dog out multiple times a day / dog would not be totally alone for 8 hours. Not sure if he would have time for a long walk.
* I work 20 min away from our house M-Th, and then I work from home on Fridays.
* We both grew up with family dogs / pets. I grew up in the country, and we had a lot more room back home to let our dogs just do their thing outdoors. Growing up I did not have to walk a dog daily (but it's something I'm willing to do.)
* I worked for a small company in college for about 7 months where I was a dog walker, dog sitter, and doggy daycare supervisor. I also encouraged basic commands and training there, but I wouldn't say I was officially a trainer.

**Things I'm Willing and Expect To Do:**

* Doggy daycare for a full day, once a week for playtime and to meet other dogs
* Pay for training courses, especially in the first few years of the dogs life
* Practice training at home daily 
* Would consider a dog sport depending on the price 
* Walk / play for around an hour a day (maybe more if my boyfriend is able to during his work day)
*  Bring the dog with me whenever I can, to pet friendly stores and to run chores with me 
* Board the dog, if necessary for long trips (family lives about an hour away, they all have other dogs and would probably be willing to watch them) 
* Pay for pet sitter / walker if we are both gone for short trips / long days
* Buy / make lots of fun toys!
* Watch a shit ton of how-to videos / be creative with training.

**Things I'm Not Willing To Deal With or Do:**

&amp;#x200B;

* A dog that will run away and not come back (poor recall)
* Constant barking 
* High aggression / mean to my cats 
* Extremely destructive behavior at home even with walks, training, and playtime each day (post puppy stage, I know puppies are just destructive in general)
* Needs more than 1-2 hours total of *undevoted* playtime / exercise a day and will become a psychopath without it 
* A dog that is terrible at being alone for a few hours, if need be 
* A dog that has super bad separation anxiety 
* Not being able to chill for at least a few hours every day - I love to read books, watch shows and movies, etc. so I want to make sure the dog is okay with chilling sometimes, too.
* Have my entire life become my dog 

Basically, I want to know what your experiences are with these types of dogs. Are you still able to have somewhat normal lives? Do they take over your entire life? Is it a hindrance to you, in your opinion?

I know that getting a dog means time and responsibility - which is something I am looking forward to. If anything, a dog would help me become more structured, too. I'm just not sure how much I can handle. I want to give a dog a great life, and want to have the most insight possible before taking the leap.

Lastly, please be kind in the replies. :)

I am going to visit every weekend and break if i end up leaving him at home. He’s very clingy when it comes to me. At home, he will have 25/8 supervision and attention.

400,dogs,"Hello! My wife and I intend to adopt a dog from our local animal shelter early next year. She's only ever had cats and while I had family dogs when I was a child, I've never been responsible for one. So we're trying to do our research, but one area I'm coming up short on is crate training.

I have tried training him to be quiet when alone without any success. Whenever I walk out the door he starts barking and freaking out nearly immediately.

Even if I leave him kongs and puzzle toys he will completely ignore them and start barking like crazy.

406,dogs,"So this may be a long one but I could really use some help. My girlfriend and I have been together for about 8 months. We both came into the relationship with dogs. I have 2 labs, 7 and 2. She has a bernadoodle that’s 3. 

Her doodle and my younger lab don’t always get along. Most of the time it seems like the problem is that my lab has a toy that her dog wants or is invading his space as labs tend to do. Now most of the time her dog will just growl or bark at my lab and occasionally will lunge but they’ve never fought and he’s never bitten my lab. My lab always immediately lays down and surrenders. Other than his issues with my younger lab he’s always been a really sweet dog, he even gets along great with my older lab. The issues really only appear around my younger lab.

Last night her dog growled at my lab and she reached down to keep her doodle from following my lab as he ran away and her dog bit her hand. It wasn’t a bad bite but did draw blood. She immediately broke down in tears because she’s afraid her sister in law won’t let her and her dog be around her nieces and nephew and that her dad will make her put him down. I got her calmed down and assured her I’d take him in rather than letting him be put down (we don’t live together yet).

I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do/how can we fix the behavior issue? He really is a good dog most of the time but I don’t think it would be wrong to avoid the kids for a while. I think my girlfriend got a dog because of the non-shedding and doodles are cute rather than a dog that fit her lifestyle. When we first started dating I tried to point out some things I saw behaviorally in him but she would get defensive and try to say our dogs’ problems together were equally the fault of both. The thing is my dogs are typical labs and pretty great. I’m not a perfect dog owner but they have zero aggression or guarding behavior, listen to all commands, and have great recall. I spent so much time on training mine and it honestly doesn’t feel like she did with hers, despite claiming she did. I wasn’t around then so it’s hard for me to dispute and I don’t have experience with other breeds, but I have 2 examples of pretty well trained dogs and know what I had to put in to get that result. 

Are their things I should know about doodles specifically that can help our situation? We live in a small rural community so there aren’t a lot of options for behavioral specialists and well reviewed trainers near by.

409,dogs,"So, I'm moving next year to a rural area. I've been looking at dogs that are good in that kind of environment (read: won't get picked up by a hawk or fox) and was thinking of getting a hound. I don't have a background in hunting, but it's something I've had in the back of my mind if I had the opportunity to learn. If it ends up not being something I can do, should I avoid getting a hound if I can't give it the kind of activity it was bred for? I don't want to be cruel. Would giving it general exercise (walking/running around the property with me, maybe keeping some minimal livestock in check—at the very least, not eating chickens) be enough to compensate if he can't go treeing and tracking?

If I could still be a good owner for one, is there any specific type of hound a newer owner (I grew up with a jack russell but don't know if ""owning"" a dog as a 10 year old counts) should keep away from or be good for? I read that blueticks can be stubborn and redbones can wander off (I was hoping to be able to train mine to stick around off leash), plotts and catahoulas are more weary of strangers, etc.

411,dogs,"TLDR in title. I wanted to share my little Theo's amazing story.

A few weeks ago, I went to pick up this little chihuahua because his owners were rehousing him. When I got there, he was scared, nervous, and obviously shaken to be away from his home. Unfortunately, when I went to pick him up (I know, stupid move in hindsight), he rushed backwards and slipped off his harness.

His original owners and I all rushed after him, but we were too late because he had rushed into traffic. A regular sedan literally went OVER his body. I did not see it, but the owner said the tire literally flipped him over as it rolled. He was obviously hurt and shaking, bleeding from lots of little abrasions.

We carefully got him into his crate, and I drove us to the nearest pet hospital. They referred us to another hospital that specialized in surgeries, and he stayed overnight. They checked his blood, did x-rays, and gave him lots of attention, but luckily, little Theo SURVIVED, needing no surgeries. The nurses said they were amazed, and said he was ""made of steel.""

The only injuries he sustained were a couple of internal bleeding spots and outwards abrasions. The only thing left a few weeks later is an abrasions with little fur on his hind right leg. We treated the bleeding with medicine for about a week.

It's been a few weeks, and he is so sweet. He plays well with my other dogs, runs around, jumps like a pogo-stick, and barks like a siren. Well worth the heartache and anxiety.

416,dogs,"After me and my brother went off to college some 3 and 5 years ago, respectfully, my parents decided they wanted to adopt 2 mini Aussie puppies. These dogs have been so easy going and are incredibly sweet, but in September of this year my parents found out their mother was being retired from breeding and decided they wanted to adopt her so she’d end up in a good house with some familiar faces (her puppies). 

I just traveled home for winter break on Sunday and since this is my first week being home the entire semester, this is also the first time me and the new dog (mom) have been around eachother. Long story short, she has not stopped barking/ growling at me and will rarely come out of her crate even if I’m not nearby. I’ve found out that giving her the occasional treat seems to calm her down and gain some momentary trust, but she goes right back to barking as soon as I try to do just about anything throughout the house. 

I’ve talked to my brother about it and he says he’s had the same experiences with her as I have. My parents believe she’s acting like this because my brother had to give her a bath when he was watching her (she hates baths) and that makes her wary of new people. But, Apparently she has been just fine with all of my parents friends and even their kids when they come over to visit.

He always looks like he wants to play and doesn't even bark at my little dogs, just sniffs through the fence and runs back and forth with them.

He only has a makeshift, almost like a lean-to, made of some corrugated metal and plywood.

436,dogs,"Hello fellow humans.  I am not a dog owner, as I don't have the time needed to properly care for a dog. I honestly think many dog owners in my area do not have the time either, but im not in charge of who does what. 

My concern is for my family and the neighbor golden retriever.  The dog is only 3 years old.  She has begun the worrisome act of charging the fence when I am near. The fence is short maybe 3 feet and not a real blockade for a young dog.   Recently it escalated to charging when my back is turned.   My woodshed is near the property line.  Obviously there is a lot of barking...all of the time really.  And I know this poor pup is in a spot that is too small for her to run, and has minimal human experience as her owners don't seem to take her out.  

Do I try and give her dog treats so she associates me with food and not aggression?  Other than the occasional yell of ""quiet!"" I don't want to hurt the silly thing.  But I don't want my family being hurt either.  The neighbors are ambivalent and state ""ohh she's just playing""..  i don't know... I have never had dogs.  I know when a play bark happens...I think... and this is not a play.

454,dogs,"Hi there 

When I was about four years old my grandmother rescued a puppy who had bullet wounds and overall a nasty job done to him. We were from a village so he guarded our chickens &amp; farm from foxes, hawks etc. He had herding instincts and acted as sort of a watchdog towards people too, but was very friendly and loving once he knew who you were. He was a medium sized dog, a little on the smaller side, but not a tiny dog.

He's passed away a few years ago from age but I always wondered what breeds potentially were in the mix. He was very special to me.

455,dogs,"i’m still shaking omg i need to let this out somewhere. so i was walking with my dogs, a chihuahua and a medium sized mutt (that is kinda reactive to male dogs). first, i met a lady from our neighborhood in her car warning me that her dog escaped and she is searching for him, note that her dog is a large breed and is known to be aggressive towards male dogs (both my dogs are males) like when the owners take him for walks they have to be in two, one holding the dog and the other one has to look out for dogs and warning the owners to be careful… so the lady left, i was about to leave as well, but i wanted to wait just another few minutes so my dogs could take a morning shit yk. took a few looks around, and ofc the giant dog appears like magic!!! haha...
i was running for my and my dogs life. i was terrified ok i know this is not exactly the best way to approach the situation but i didn’t know better in the moment. thankfully the dog was pretty far away, and he didn’t sprint toward us.
then i found this store, i got inside immediately and asked for the owners if i could stay here while i call my mom so she can pick us up with her car. the owner was so sweet and understanding, but the were some customers that literally laughed at me for being so freaked out and out of breath and one of them had the audacity to say “oh it’s just a dog lol chill” like bro are you for real.
i’m still kinda freaked out right now, like i don’t even know if it’ll be safe to walk my dogs again today or tomorrow like how do i know if the lady found him or not?…

456,dogs,"Yesterday at 5 pm, my puppy threw up after eating a few bites of kibble. It only had the small piece of plain potato I gave her in it and threw bites of food she just ate. I thought maybe she was hungry, she normally doesn’t throw up. I took the food away and waited about an hour because she was obviously very hungry since she didn’t have dinner, then fed it to her. (She pooped twice so far this day both solid). Then about an hour after she threw up her food, In whole pieces. I cleaned it up and she laid with me on the couch the rest of the night and went to sleep. We got up around 12:00 am to take her out before bed. She pooped again, solid then when I brought her in the bedroom she threw up two small piles of yellow bile. So far she’s thrown up four times. I’m extremely worried, but everything I’m seeing is wait twenty four hours. Earlier this year I had a chihuahua mix that my parents were watching that ate entire peach pit and five k later she was doing well and ended up getting sepsis after the bowel obstruction.

460,dogs,"Hello,

So we just adopted a new dog last week and he's a med/large boi \~25kg mixed breed and about 20 months. He's been sweet and quite easygoing but he jumps up on us as soon as we step out of the door (he's outdoor-only because we have a cat that is indoor-only - don't worry he's got a crate, kennel, and lots of shaded dry areas and it doesn't get very cold). 

When he jumps up on me I generally walk away from him but he'll just try again. Someone suggested walking towards him instead (so that he'll have to step backwards) but when I do that he just wraps his front legs around my waist/legs and try to hug me. Which is very cute but I don't really want to encourage the behavior (especially since his paws are really muddy sometimes lol).

And then today in addition to the jumping he started to try to hold my arm in his mouth especially when I push him away? Ngl I'm a little concerned because he is almost half my weight and there doesn't seem to be anything aggressive with him but still. I don't like any part of me in a dog's mouth. Any ideas as to why he might be doing that? 

I understand that he's new so needs time to adjust but he's my first dog so maybe I am just anxious and overthinking so would appreciate any tips. We are planning to send him for obedience training but that will be only in at least another month or so.

461,dogs,"I have a beagle, who is often a loving and playful dog, who has some attitudes and behaviors that I need to figure out a way to change for me to be able to treat him fairly.  When on walks, every time he sees another dog, and often when he sees a human (especially if they are running or biking, but sometimes just casual pedestrians), he begins to bark uncontrollably.  It don't think it is aggression or fear.  I think he is frustrated that he is on a leash and can't meet them.  But as soon as he starts this behavior, he becomes a community nascence, so he rarely gets to meet people on walks and never gets to meet dogs (which I know he wants to), and I also have to end his walk early because he is annoying most people and amusing a few people because they can relate.  This prevents him from getting the exercise he deserves.  

He also sometimes becomes territorial on my bed.  When this happens, he gets kicked off the bed (not literally kicked).  I enjoy his company on the bed as long as he realizes that he has to work around me and not get upset when he is either disturbed or told to move.  Sometimes after kicking him off the bed I try to make him look me in the eye as I explain that his behavior/attitude is unacceptable (I know he doesn't understand most the words, but I think he understands the gist of what I am trying to tell him).  

He is capable of house training, and this is partially my fault, because at times I haven't been completely diligent in taking him out quite enough (although a 4 year old beagle shouldn't need to go out every 3 hours or less), and I am finding it impossible to remove the urine odor completely of ""his urination area"".  My room doesn't smell like urine to me, but I'm sure there is enough urine odor for a beagle to detect.  Sometimes I take him out, he urinates, then urinates again inside in less than an hour.  Also, he will often urinate on the floor while I am preparing to take him out.  When he does this, there is no point in taking him out immediately, but I don't know how long I should wait before taking him out again.

Whenever he has access to a window he takes the opportunity to bark at every passerby.  I try to deny him access to windows as much as possible.

I try to take good care of him and treat him with love, but sometimes his attitude and behavior causes me express frustration to him.  

I know a beagle is a beagle, and I need to put some effort into training (I don't even know how), but the bottom line is the dynamics need to change.  He needs to learn his place as a dog and also how to behave politely in public.  My last dog was a lab, who had some troubling behaviors when he was young, didn't even need formal training to learn to be a well behaved dog that everyone (both people and most dogs) loved, so trying to figure out how to change the dynamics with my beagle is a bit confusing.  My lab just naturally learned proper behavior, and as a result was able to spend more time outdoors, meet other dogs, and not experience my frustration.  I just want the dynamics to change, I just don't know where to begin.",t2_4t3x3287,0,"Please help, my beagle needs to adjust his attitude and behavior for me to be able to treat him fairly","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zlk24z,True,jzjac515,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zlk24z/please_help_my_beagle_needs_to_adjust_his/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zlk24z/please_help_my_beagle_needs_to_adjust_his/,2471107,1671000616,0,,False,1671000626,1671000626,2022-12-14 06:50:16,,,,,,,
462,dogs,"We don’t know why his kidneys are failing. If he’s not looking better tomorrow morning we may need to transfer him out of state to a place where they can do dialysis, because I guess it’s not a very common thing they do for dogs. 

Even with dialysis, if they can’t figure out what’s going on in order to treat it, there’s a chance his kidneys may not recover. Then it would only be a matter of time before he passes because it seems they don’t do dialysis long term in dogs like they do in people. We’ll know more in the morning when they recheck his labs.

I am distraught. That furball is my whole entire world. I grew up with dogs, but he was the first dog that was ever mine, that I picked out as an adult in my own home. I don’t have children, so he is absolutely like my child, and I do not know what I will do if he doesn’t come home. 

He’s my hiking buddy, my cuddle buddy, my confidant, my best friend, my personal heated-weighted blanket. He has loved cuddling from the minute we met him. Deep cuddling, like he wants to melt his body into yours and never leave you. I don’t know what I will do if he leaves me. 

He’s a 9 year old rescue hound-lab mix that we’ve had for 7 incredible years. He was a dog of the streets who came to the shelter with so many infections and wounds they had to start a go fund me for his medical bills. It took him 5 months to recover before he was adoptable. 

We met him at an adoption event from the rescue agency. It was the first day he was healthy enough to travel to a show. He hopped off the van, and my husband said, “What about that one?!” And that was it. We fell in love with him as fast as he fell in love with us. 

He didn’t know his name or any commands, but he was so treat motivated, he’d learned to sit by the end of day one. He didn’t know how to play with toys, but figured that out with some treat help too. He flunked out of doggie kindergarten because he was so fearful of the other dogs, but with some private one on one training sessions, he was eventually able to go back to class and graduated from doggie kindergarten, middle school, and high school. 

He is the smartest, cleverest dog I’ve ever met. We had to install locks on our trash cans because he figured out how to use the pedals to open them. He figured out how to use his body to move chairs out from under the table to hop on them then hop on the table, to find him four paws deep in a cheese pizza. He stole a turkey off the Thanksgiving table once, and a pan of fish from Christmas Eve. 

He is sweet and kind and never met a tiny kiddo he didn’t want to rub his belly. He has the sweetest, most convincing puppy dog eyes that cannot be argued with. He has me wrapped around his little paw. I would do anything for this boy. 

So how do I cope when there’s nothing I can do but wait and hope? How does anyone get through this? 

He went blind 10 months ago. Suddenly. The veterinary ophthalmologist diagnosed him with an autoimmune condition called SARDS, sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome, but other than that he was a perfectly healthy boy. SARDS doesn’t usually have any other associated medical problems, so we figured continue on with annual check ups. Six months into his blindness, he was just as smart and wonderful as ever, but hurt his leg from a misstep and needed an ortho evaluation. Even at that time, totally fine otherwise. 

He recovered from that injury in less than a month and was back to being his normal, persistent pursuer of treats self. He howled sll Halloween at every trick or treaters who came to our door. Then, about a month ago, he just started slowing down. I didn’t realize it at first, but looking back he did. He was a smidge unsteady on his feet, but we chocked it up to him being blind and having a difficult time navigating new places. The week of thanksgiving, I made my husband schedule a grooming appointment because he “just didn’t smell like himself” and I couldn’t figure out why. It didn’t go away with the bath though. 

We didn’t take him to the vet sooner because everything was just so subtle. Slowly progressive fatigue, mild unsteadiness, a weird smell. He was still eating, drinking, urinating, and stooling as normal. He wasn’t drooling, limping, seizing, or obviously in any pain. It wasn’t until a few days ago when he started vomiting that I got worried.

We called, but couldn’t get a vet appointment until today. His labs showed creatinine and BUN greater than the upper detectable limit of normal with associated electrolyte abnormalities. When I saw the results, it all made sense. The fatigue, slowness, increasing time spent sleeping, unsteadiness, smell… he’s uremic from rapidly progressive kidney failure that I somehow missed for the last month. 

I am a human physician. I treat renal failure patients both in hospital admissions and outpatient clinic appointments. I know this disease, so I just don’t know how I missed all the signs and why I didn’t do something sooner. 

I’m kicking myself, but mostly I’m just scared and sad that I might lose my baby, my best friend in the whole world. I also wish I could be in the hospital with him. But I am stuck at home, away from my best boy, with nothing to occupy my time and keep my worry at bay. I haven’t stopped crying since 4pm. So… that’s why I’m here writing this long post that no one is ever going to read all of. 

But anyway, if you did make it this far, and you believe in a God, gods, spirit, powerful being, or inexplicable force in the universe, I’ll take thoughts and prayers from any and all sources.

This thing (pictures in the link below) showed up on my dogs mouth around mid October. I've taken him to the vet twice for it, just to make sure it's nothing of concern. They haven't been able to give me a definitive answer to what it is, but they guessed it is either a skin tag, a papilloma, or some sort of benign tumor. Just wondering if anyone else's dog had one of these. Did it go away or is it here to stay? Should I be worried about it spreading to other dogs? Just hoping someone else has experienced something similar, and can give me some ideas of what to do and how to handle it.

He went to daycare 2 days a week and was home alone 2 days a week, and the transition honestly went seamlessly. I was shocked. 

The only odd behaviour that popped up when I began leaving him alone for 8-10 hours a day was that he would jump onto the laundry basket, knock it over, and bring my dirty laundry all over the house. He didn’t chew the laundry, and is pretty gentle so I’ve never had any damage to my clothes. He’s also never been a chewer or toy destroyer, so I’m not overly worried about him eating the laundry.

We recently took in a corgi, Peanut(Female), because another dog at her home was instigating fights. We introduced the dogs slowly and gave them each attention separately, and together with my brother. 

It's been a few weeks, and they usually hang around in the backyard together where I can see them. I try to play with them together, and for the most part, aside from some barking while bringing the ball back, they get along okay. 

This escalated tonight. I brought both of them in, and I usually stagger when I do, but they both bolted in faster than I could grab one. They both jumped on the couch, a spot I usually hang out with them on separately. I'm not sure which dog instigated what, I thought it was Ein because she barks at Peanut a lot and was snapping, but I can't be sure. All I know next is they are full-on fighting, Peanut put her mouth on Ein's neck, and eventually her ear while Ein was trying to run away. I got them both separated, and thankfully there was no injuries despite Peanut having her mouth on Ein's ear for around 8 seconds. 

I don't know how to proceed aside from keeping them separated. I've never had dogs fight, so I don't know if Peanut not biting down is a sign it's just a squabble or what.

491,dogs,"Walls of text incoming but I dunno where else to ask.  
So, some context.  My sister's from Guatemala, got her green card from being the spouse of an American citizen. She and her husband bought a 'Mini' Aussie Doodle boy about 10 months ago when he was still a small puppy. Not too long after that she was expecting, which doctors said would be difficult for her to achieve. They decided to go forward with the pregnancy but after some exams they realized maternity healthcare for her would be very difficult and costly in the US to the point they decided to go through labor in Guatemala.   


The problem now being that, this was a decision that had to be made quickly recently and they'll fly within a month. So they haven't had much time to train the dog for separation anxiety nor the money to leave him in a boarding kennel for several months. Not to mention he grew a bunch, about 32 lbs now, and he seems to fit comfortably enough to move a bit inside his 18 x 11 x 11 kennel but not enough to not touch at least one kennel wall doing so.   


While she has friends that have offered to take care of the little guy, I already had to take care of him for a weekend that they had to travel to another state for a family emergency and he was much quieter, still and ate/drank less when they were out, often waiting for them to come back despite my attempts at playing and spending time with him, opting to sleep for longer times. I've visited their home other times and the dog is usually really energetic, bright and vocal when they are around. Feels like a coin toss whether Delta, the airline that they have tickets with, will accept him travelling on Cabin due to his size. They have the medical paperwork and are aware of Pet travel laws in Guatemala. I worry that being apart for several months could produce a lot of stress on the dog, my sister and her husband.

492,dogs,"I have a 10 month old puppy who has been to two different daycares in the past 5 months. Each one came with their own troubles. 

The first one- the very first time I took her there she came home covered in urine. I bathed her and the water ran yellow. I addressed it with the owners and they apologized and informed me if the dogs get dirty they do bathe them. So I took her back a few times without issue. The last time I took her there I picked her up with a pierced ear. Her ear was visibly bleeding and the tooth of another dog had pierced all the way through. When I talked to the owners they had no idea what had happened and said nobody saw a fight occur, and that my dog “plays rough” so it “makes sense”. I told them we wouldn’t be coming back. 

The second one, it took me a couple of months to try another daycare. I took her for her first day and she came home with a few bite marks that were noticeable. I talked with the daycare about my concerns especially after my last experience and she was super apologetic and said the dogs were playing but nothing crazy happened. I took her word for it and tried again. When I picked her up tonight from daycare, I had received a text earlier in the day that she may have a small mark on her ear from playing a little too rough. I thanked them for letting me know. 

We got home and the entire side of her face has bite marks, scratches, dried blood. A few marks are within a half inch of her eye. She has scratch marks all over her entire underside and red rash marks on her. I have every intention of contacting them in the morning when the owner is in, and I’m taking her to the vet to get checked out. 

Has anyone had similar experiences with daycares? Is it typical for dogs to come home with several marks every time they’re playing with other dogs?

496,dogs,"My 13 or 14 year old border collie pup was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in August. It’s manageable with meds for up to about 1 year, which I think sounded fantastic. I guess I was thinking we were going to have a full year. 

She slowed down her eating about 3 days ago. I started giving her prednisone daily to help boost her appetite. She is now vomiting and having diarrhea. She did have some of a protein drink this afternoon and boiled chicken for breakfast, but both came up. 

Our other pup is similar in age and doing fantastically. They have been together all but basically his first 3 months of life.

Here is the crossroads- we leave in 3 days for a once in a lifetime family trip for a week. Our family plus 2 branches of extended family. I have a friend coming to take care of our dogs. I’m seriously so nervous that she isn’t going to make it while we are gone. It sounds so very traumatic for her to know we left if she were to go. But also sounds completely awful to let her go if she is just battling some nausea and vomiting and low appetite again. (She has been on chemo since August- she actually has done really well on it.) And both instances for my other pup who doesn’t know life without his sister- to either hope she makes it and doesn’t while we aren’t even there or to let her go and then leave him alone with a stranger for a week. 

I’m calling the vet again tomorrow because the recommendation to give her prednisone daily isn’t effective if she is no longer taking it. I don’t know if anyone has any advice.

512,dogs,"So, me and 3 friends of mine recently moved into a house in Detroit. I went away for a trip out of the country and while I was gone (not even a week into living in this house), my roommate was heading out the door and a dog was right at our doorstep. He had a collar and leash on him and ran inside but they were unable to find the owner after asking around the neighborhood. All they were able to find out was that the he got loose from his owner and his name is King. 

Fast forward, I get back and he has been living in the house with us because the owner essentially abandoned him. We found this out when one of my roommates took him to a vet to get a quick check up, as well as, to see if he has a microchip, which he does...neither the vet nor the company that issued the chip could get in touch with the owner. 

So King has been with us for about a month now. He is such a nice boy, super cute, and relatively trained with a leash. He is 2 years old, about 60 lbs and the vet said he is an American Staffordshire Terrier. He is having some potty training trouble inside (most likely cause of the separation from his previous owner, but idk), and he gets really excited around new people, which usually means jumping up on them and sometimes barking. He can definitely sense peoples energy and how they feel about him and it seems like he wants everyone in the room to like him. He gets really antsy around other dogs but he is definitely a people dog. 

Unfortunately, we can't keep him for a number of reasons. 

Firstly, we are leasing a house and we aren't actually allowed to have dogs live with us. They did say that if we really want it would be a $300 fee plus $50 a month. If they find out we have an animal in the house they will assume that it has been living with us from the beginning and they will charge us the full fee.

Second, the house is not an ideal spot for the dog or us. We have been keeping him on the first floor primarily and not allowing him up stairs (which we can't really control at night) into our bedrooms. We also took away all the rugs because we don't want them to get dirty or have any accidental potty breaks on them which pretty much happen everyday, somewhere around the house but have been minimized to 2-3 spots. On top of that, he really needs a yard to run around in because he is a really high energy dog. 

Third, I am allergic to dogs. Not deathly allergic, but I have to be careful to make sure I take my allergy meds and if I do touch him, to wash my hands right away.

Fourth, one of my roommates has sort of taken charge of being his caretaker for the time while we try to find him a foster family but really none of us are fit or willing to take care of him full time to the extent that he really needs. 

There are a few other reasons but these are the main ones. We had some hope when Rebel Dogs in Detroit helped us find a potential foster who took him in for a bit to see if he would be the right fit but that ended up not working out. Now it's been almost two weeks and we haven't had any requests or inquiries. Additionally, I am feeling a lull in the effort to find King a home from the whole situation, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or ideas in what we can do to help him find a home. Thank you!

513,dogs,"Hello all! 

I will soon be visiting far-away family. They have a male 3-4 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. I've met him only twice as I can only visit 1-2x a year. The dog was excited to meet me the first time over 2019's Christmas when I spent 4 days with his family. Due to the pandemic, I skipped visiting over 2020-2021 and the the next time I saw him was this summer for just a couple days. He was much different, and I'm going to guess because he fell out of practice with near-strangers or for-real strangers in his home due to the pandemic restricting socializing. 

When I came into his house the 2nd time, he was high energy, barking but friendly. He calmed down after I settled in, but then when I stood up from a chair in the living room, he ran at me, barking, hackles raised. My family yelled at him and he quieted but clearly was unhappy with me there and would follow me, growling and barking. Later, I went into the kitchen, and he rushed in after me, and was very upset, barking again with eyes rolling, and I panicked and stamped my foot to try to scare him off. I realized shortly after this made me more scary to him (and he was probably defending his food bowls) and he barked more aggressively, but did not bite thankfully. 

When he had calmed down, I started to bribe him with safe snacks when he was calm and praising him for sitting calmly, which worked briefly for a few minutes per snack, but he was still upset if I moved around the house and would follow me with more barking and growling. 

My family decided he needed to be crated during my waking hours, which I do not think is his ""safe"" spot, more like his ""time-out"" punishment spot. 

This Christmas, I had initially planned to stay with this family another 4 days, and bring more bribery snacks. But the more I thought about it, the more nervous I got (I have been bitten a few times by dogs when a child, mostly not my fault, once requiring stitches at an ER once a loose out-of-town large dog ran up to me and bit me as I walked slowly away without facing him). I don't blame dogs when I am at fault. 

I asked my family about how he was doing now, and they told me he was still being a ""jerk"" but they were ""working with him"" though they had dropped some attempted clicker training a while back. He does okay with people visiting he knows well, like grocery delivery staff or the children's friends, but he is very defensive when he has strangers in his space, barking and growling. I think he is walked at least 2x a day and has a medium-sized yard to run around and burn off energy in, and lives happily with two cats, so has is not really a mean dog by any means, but defensive.

After more thought, I decided to ask if they could maybe board the dog while I was there visiting overnight for 4 days, and I would happily cover the boarding cost. I totally understand this is their home -- and the dog's home -- and as a guest, I can only ask. I said if they would rather not board the dog, I could stay elsewhere and visit them for a few hours over several days when it wouldn't require crating the poor dog very long, just let me know.

Now I have heard nothing back after emailing and I am afraid I offended them. I plan to follow up with a phone call tomorrow and see how they feel. 

Would you have handled this differently? I'm curious what would have been the best way to handle this and if I misstepped.

But since we had to stay a week off for work (recently, she was 5 month 2 weeks old), and I left her with my big bro, she has been stressed, barks a lot and is agressive towards dogs and strangers.

She used to love dogs and people, whenever we went out she’d want to play with everyone. So we are weirded out that she changed so much in so little time!

Also read that carrageenan can cause gastric inflammation, so perhaps the wet food is the cause. Welcome any advice, thank you!

527,dogs,"Sorry this is long:

A little back story. We adopted my Labrador about 12-13 years ago. Her age and background weren't known but the vet guessed she was between 1 and 2 years old based on her teeth. However, she immediately began going grey and to this day her teeth are pristine and white so she may be even older than the 14 years old we are guessing she is?

Everything was fine with her. She was slowing down but still reasonably active. Then suddenly 1 week ago she started limping and wouldn't put her left rear leg down. I would have to lift her rump to get her to stand up and even then she'd just collapse. I'm disabled so I can't lift her fully so my neighbor would come and try to help get her to go outside and she'd just collapse and wouldn't relieve herself. She also stopped drinking and eating. Brought her to the vet the next day. They did some minimal blood work and gave me antibiotics (she had a fever of 106) and pain pills. The vet said it looked like she's got neurological or spinal problems because she actually was having issues with all her legs. 

Brought her home, and 3 days later brought her back in. Her fever was gone but she still won't eat, even really enticing human food and it's been a struggle to get her to move. Vet did more blood work and took an x-ray (no spinal tumor), but still doesn't know what's going on. She said maybe it's neurological.

I've had other senior dogs and they would fight to live, two of them living past 20. She is acting like she's just giving up and still in a lot of pain. This afternoon she started having seizures on and off. 

Obviously we need to bring her back to the vet. The tech who answers the phone said we need an MRI and all sorts of other tests. I've already spent about $1000 on the tests (and drugs) we've done so far and it's revealed nothing and done nothing to help. The tech is trying to guilt me into pushing for more and more tests. Even if we figure out what's wrong, there's no guarantee that it's fixable or that she'll live much longer anyway. 

I feel like my dog is trying to tell me she doesn't want to fight any more. If this were a 5 year old dog I could understand, but she's at the very minimum 14 years old. She's already at the end of the average lifespan.  I feel like pushing her to live is being cruel, especially since she's basically starving to death and in pain. But the vet tech is acting like I'm being unreasonable and I'm being an awful owner by wanting to end her suffering. She even said to me if we put her down, then we need to bring her body home ""to dispose of her."" I've always had my pets cremated and it's always been done through the company picking up from the vet. It seems like the vet tech was trying to be cruel to me to lay more guilt. I should add this isn't my usual vet's office because they've been closed and we needed a vet ASAP.

I guess I'm asking if I'm being a horrible person by putting my dog down? I thought I was doing the humane thing but this vet tech has me feeling even worse about my decision. It wasn't an easy decision either - obviously I want my dog to live forever but I'm trying to be realistic.",t2_yh0z08e,0,Should I put my dog down?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zl8uao,True,Amazon421,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zl8uao/should_i_put_my_dog_down/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zl8uao/should_i_put_my_dog_down/,2470968,1670969916,0,,False,1670969932,1670969932,2022-12-13 22:18:36,,,,,,,

534,dogs,"So, my dog (Gus, almost 11 year old Labrador) has suddenly been acting really weird. This is long. Sorry!

Note before I get into it: we went to the vet this morning and did a physical check-up, so I'm definitely not ignoring or only using the internet for advice. I've got the medical professionals on it too! 

Anyway, my dog is the bestest boy.  He's old and sweet and lazy and perfect. He's had two strokes in the past two years, but has mostly recovered from them and has a great quality of life.  Just a few weeks ago we did a 2.5 hour hike and he rocked the whole thing (dropped and snoozed in the car on the way home, but he loved it!)

On Friday we had to go out for about 6 hours (from 6pm to midnight). He was left home alone.  He's virtually never home alone (someone is always home with him). So I get that he was probably little nervous and during this time he decided to be a stinker and found my kid's bowl of chocolate and gummies.  He ate them. About 12 fun-size chocolate bars (milk chocolate) and fruit gummies.  After that we monitored him and nothing. No vomiting, no diarrhea, eating and drinking as normal. Same happy guy. All weekend.

Yesterday, everything shifted. Since yesterday morning, he's been looking sad, can't seem to settle on his bed (keeps getting up, wandering around, then will lie down for another 5 mins and start the process over.  He's also walking around with his tail tucked and sometimes just stands and stares at his bed.

Side note: we got him a new bed two weeks ago. Since he got it, he's been living in his bed, having the best sleeps and being all snuggly. We got him a cot bed to relieve pressure on his joints and placed an older, flat bed on top so it ""smelled right.""

The vet can't see anything wrong with him. He definitely recognized his behavior change but there's no apparent physical cause.  No pain. No heart issues. Vision seems good. Not even the expected stiffness due to age. Weight has been pretty stable (within 1kg for a year - he's 30.3kg/66.7 lbs). 

So the plan now is to monitor him for a couple more days and if there's no improvement, we'll take him back for blood work and a urinalysis. Vet is positive this isn't in response to his late night Friday snackage, since it would have caused issues earlier and he's physically fine.

I'm just not sure what's wrong. He keeps looking at me with sad eyes, like he wants me to make it better and I don't know how.  He seems so sad and uncomfortable. Anyone have experience like this? Anything else I can be watching for?

We'll go for another walk soon (the one thing that seems to perk him up is meeting his girl at the bus after school, but I'm pretty sure that's because it signals supper time).

Non-medical advice? Reassurance? Anything else I should be checking or tracking until we go back to the vet?

536,dogs,"For background information, I have two dogs. One of them is a small, fluffy white chihuahua that my dad picked up off the street at 12 weeks old. His name is Dodo. We’ve had him for about a year and a half. However a few months ago, my dad bought another 2 month old Taiwan dog named Tiger. My dad got him because he really wanted a guard dog. 

However, he never consulted our family at all about bringing Tiger home. He kind of just did it. Naturally, my mother was furious. This isn’t even the first time he’s done this. My mom demanded that he return the dog, and he refused.

We’ve had tiger for a few months now, and I feel really sorry for him. He lives in our yard and my mother never lets him in the house. Dodo used to live in the house with us, but my dad complained about it being unfair and now they both live in the yard (in actuality Im pretty sure he just never liked having ANY dogs in the home). 

My mother occasionally lets Dodo in. However, she always shuts the glass door right in Tiger’s face if he tries to enter. She also shoos him away and makes kicking gestures at him a lot. She loves portraying Dodo as a “victim” of Tiger as well. My dad always tells her to take care of Tiger as well as Dodo but this only makes her angrier at both of them. I mean, I understand why she’s upset, but isn’t it a little cruel to take it out on the dog? 

Tiger has made it a habit to whine, lick, the glass door, and frantically claw at it. The sound of him pounding on the door is essentially a constant at my house now. He always desperately leaps on anyone he can, and it’s impossible for him to sit still. 

I try to play with him whenever I can, but I have important applications due soon and have been really busy. I feel really bad for this dog, but it’s not like I can just let him in. My mom would never allow it.

539,dogs,"A little backstory, I have a four year old dachshund. He has always displayed anxious type of behavior, such as excessive licking and panting. He also tends to cry or whimper a lot in the car, or if I even step out of the house to throw out the trash. The worst of his anxious behaviors is a very loud shrieking that he does when I leave to work. This previously was not such a problem because I lived in a house, but I recently moved to an apartment.

This past Sunday, I took him to the vet in search of some kind of medication for this behavior and his anxiety. They prescribed him trazodone 25 mg daily one hour before I leave to work. For the past two days I have administered it as I was told, but feel like it has not done anything. so I had a few questions…

Should I give it to him earlier than one hour before my departure? Also, does this medication just take a couple weeks to kick in? I’ve even considered maybe giving him 25 mg twice a day.

My girl is a Blue Tick that was a rescue from an Amish breeding mill. She has had a stroke before we got her and the right side of her face droops a bit along with some slobber but she has done just fine in spite of it.  


Recently we noticed that her back legs kept going out on her so we took her to the vet and they began giving her some shots to help with a disk issue in her back that according to them is pinching the nerve and causing her to lose feeling in her back legs. This has actually I believe gotten better since treatment 4 days ago. She just got another shot today and has one more to go. She was given some pain killers as well, which we have been giving her as directed by the vet.  


The newest issue has come up in the middle of this. She will turn her head all the way to the right and begin shaking left and right. This looks almost like tremors or Parkinson's disease and seems obviously involuntary.

I adopted a dog 8 months ago at the shelter. The shelter hide us the reason of the surrender, and told us ""it's normal for the dog to bark when it is alone, it'll be better in some months. You are lucky ! She doesn't destroy. Let's crate train her !"".


She still bark, she destroy now, and she is traumatized after breaking 2 crates. I can't crate her in the car....



I am unemployed, I can have some money for some months. But, when it'll stop, I'll have to go back to work. Puppy day car doesn't exist where I live. So if she can't stay alone, I'll have to rehome her right ?


I started the Julie Naismith method. And I think I'll add some tips from a local dog behaviorist. But, in the first method, they don't want kong and other toys like that. In the second, they do use it, to make the alone time more positif. 
Should I still use the kong ?


At first, I couldn't even step out of the door, she would be so anxious... now it's good ! I can go to the letter box, with the kong. I haven't yet tried without, I'm too afraid !

Until recently, I was never allowed to go in with him and also because of the pandemic, being understaffed, etc. the typical suggestion of taking your dog there for a pleasant visit, getting treats and pets from the staff, etc. to establish a positive association has just never been feasible.

A couple of times, he has dug his heels in front of the door and tried to get away from me. Twice he has managed to slip out of his harness/collar and our vet is located on a busy road...so that was traumatizing for both me and my dog. He usually does okay-but-not-great on the leash and pretty good at recall, but all that goes out the window at the vet.

He has an unavoidable appointment tomorrow and I am truly dreading it and at a loss for what to do. Sometimes I try to bribe him inside with food, but even that has stopped working and because he is having a procedure done tomorrow, he can't eat beforehand anyways.

Please help. I am truly at a loss of what to do and I legit worry for his safety every time we go because I am worried he will try so hard to not go inside that he will get away from me and run into the road.

553,dogs,"Our pug is 1 1/2 years old. So he’s generally still a playful pup. But he’s causing arguments between myself and my wife. In the evenings times when we’re trying to relax, he’ll beg her for attention - play biting, playing with his toys on top of her, chasing his tail on top of her. She gets annoyed at this because it’s her relaxation time, and will often shout at me to take the dog. Normally I do, and play with him a bit, then when I stop or he gets bored he’ll go back to annoy her. To be honest I sometimes think she’s a bad dog mum, as she will just tell me to get the dog away and has no interest in actually giving him any attention, she just wants to give it when he’s calm. 
Anyway, tonight I shouted and told her to just play with him, she got grumpy and said she’s going to take a shower and left the dog with me. Immediately after she left he jumped onto my lap and went straight to sleep.
Now I know there are obviously underlying problems here with her dog parenting skills, but I’m not here for me or her to be judged on that. I want to understand why my dog would act like this with only one parent?

I use a backseat cover for where he hangs out, wash that at least every two weeks and go through and sanitize it weekly as well despite that my car stills smells like a swamp.

566,dogs,"I feel terrible writing this but I’m at my wits end and I just need to get it out. 

We adopted our 2 year old lab/staffie a little over a year ago. She was a rescue and we fell in love right away. We believe she had a rough background and we did a lot of work to make her feel loved and safe. The majority of her fear and anxiety went away and it was so rewarding. 

After her first heat cycle and spay we noticed her behaviour change. She became more rough and vocal with other dogs at the dog park. Nothing too concerning, but it was definitely a surprising change from the sweet, quiet girl we knew. 

Shortly after that, she developed leash aggression towards other dogs. If she was off leash, no problem, but as soon as she went on leash she turned into a 6’4 tall man with an attitude. 

Her separation anxiety is so bad that she is a danger to herself in a crate. Because of this, we have gone through 4 couches and have become masters at plastering the walls after they’ve been destroyed.

We decided to put her in daycare - she was there for a week and was kicked out because of her breed. 

We decided to get her a full time babysitter for when we were at work. She ended up getting “fired” by the babysitter for eating her wall. 

I decided to start working from home. While our furniture is safe now, my mental health is deteriorating. At first, we would start our day in the morning at the dog park. She would play with other dogs and exhaust herself. We would come back at lunch and go after work with my partner. It was the best solution because it exhausted her. 

Then she started being aggressive with other dogs, so I tried bringing her during the quiet times. She was fine when it wasn’t too busy/stimulating. Then she became worse with that. Then she attacked a small dog (thankfully no physical damage was done) and I cannot bring her to a dog park again. I just can’t. 

Now I spend my work days being screamed at by her because I’m looking at my laptop instead of her. Attending any sort of Teams meeting is a balancing act because I have to try to appear focused, while distracting my dog off camera by throwing toys or giving her treats. I feel like her personality is unbearable 95% of the time. 

Last week I broke down and asked my partner for more help with her. Before this I had been taking care of 90% of the daily responsibilities for her and asked if we could split it even 50/50 and he said of course. That’s a huge relief, but sometimes I feel like I hate her. It’s a horrible feeling because I love her so much but she is just awful most of the time.

We’ve worked with trainers and behaviourists and I just don’t know what to do. She has a loving and safe home but she is only getting worse.

576,dogs,"My 2.5 year old dog tripped going up the stairs last week and started limping on her back right leg. Took her to banfield the next day and paid $390 for X-rays and a radiology consult which came back that she tore both her ACLs. Had a horrible experience customer service wise and am questioning their competency over all. My Banfield coverage is up in February so I was going to wait until then to discontinue with them and get on a different insurance plan but now this is considered a pre-existing condition and I can’t find a insurance company that’s willing to cover her. I want to get a second opinion before I figure out treatment but I’m wondering:

- are there any affordable vet surgeons in the greater Atlanta area?

- has anyone been told their dog tore their ACLs but actually didn’t?

580,dogs,"The larger older brother (same mother, different sire) follows the younger around sniffing his anus. He gets directly behind him and trails him so closely that it looks as if they are connected.

He takes any opportunity to lick his brother's penile sheath.

And, most troublingly, he masterbates on him by rubbing his penis on his brother's hind end. His goal, 24 hours per day is to get to his brother and perform this act. Whether his brother is standing, sitting, laying, sleeping... it never stops.

They have cubbies, and the younger retreats to his often. I then put an obstacle in front of his door, but the older pushes and pokes and prods looking for ways in. Sometimes he gets in the cubby and waits for his unsuspecting brother to enter. Other times he finds a way in when I'm not looking. When he can't get to his brother, he stalks the area where his cubby is. He will lay outside the cubby and listen for movement inside.

There have been times when the younger asserted himself used his teeth and voice to speak up, but usually not. HOWEVER, rarely, the younger has humped the older, but mainly from the side or on top of his head from the front and only when they are both standing.

586,dogs,"I work at an animal shelter, specifically in the kennel, and I’ve spent time with so many dogs and I love each and every one of them; I’m thrilled when they go home to forever homes. People ask me every day how I manage to not get emotional and “not want to take them all home with me”. My response is usually something along the lines of “oh, it wouldn’t be practical” or the “extra expense”. Which is true-between work and the commute, I’m out almost 10 hours a day and it’s not like I’m making big bucks. 

While I have managed to this point to not adopt another dog, every once in a while, a very special dog arrives at the shelter. When she sees me, she gets so excited and then we’ll snuggle for a bit if it’s not too busy. I’m actually surprised she hasn’t been scooped up yet. She has an amazing temperament, she’s absolutely stunning and the only way I can describe it is “she speaks to my soul”. 

But I do have a dog at home and consider myself very fortunate that he’s so easy-going. He’s an 8.5 year old staffy who’s been with me for 4.5 years. Because I am gone for long hours, I use a professional dog walking service, that sometimes come twice/day to walk and/or feed him. 

Besides the fact I would need to ensure they get along, I am doubting whether it would be in her best interests to adopt her. Let’s be real-not like I’m making big bucks working at a shelter, so the additional expense of food/walking, etc. is a big deal, besides the fact that I really am gone for 10 hours, 5 days a week.

592,dogs,"Hi all,   


We (me and my wife) just got our rescue dog Leddy 5 days ago she is an 8 moths old mixed breed but looks very like norwegian buhund. Since it will be our first untrained dog experience we were a little bit frustrated and also thinking about the dogs situation and traumas that she faced on the way and in her past life. As we entered the house she explore the house first then she sit on door mat, which become her place right now.

And we try to not intervene with the dog too much and just continue our lives with her, to not make her more stressed. At the very first times we go out on outside, she was super scared walk on the road or having another person in sight, or even go out of the apartment. We had to lure her to the desired location with her food. 

And since she looked so bored in the house (just laying on the front doormat) we decided to go to a dog park two days ago at the dead time. We unleashed her so she can move freely in a big area with many natural distractions. She was really happy at that day, and even allow us to rub her belly when we reached home, that was the first time she offers this. But i guess dog park was a big mistake that we have done. Because now on the walks she started dashing, pulling and setting the direction of the walk. Since now it's icy and sometimes snowing outside it's not easy to even walk for us and now I'm trying to control her dashing one side to other.

And now after our 2nd walk today i feel like maybe we got a bigger&amp;energetic dog than we should have. I guess the behaviors and this excitedly dashing pulling can calm down with training but I'm not sure how can i drain the dogs energy. Also make her familiarize us. I never seen her tail up in house even when we are petting her. I guess that is an indication that she is still not calm with us and enjoying the petting. Nevertheless we don't want to send the dog back and adapt to her as we can but i am just drained and thinking about that maybe she doesn't wants to spend most of her day in house. Maybe it's because i cannot sleep well because she is moving around the house at night when we are in bed.",t2_4yq6omph,0,Rescue dog starts to show her personality,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zkyme0,True,sunshinebehindhill,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zkyme0/rescue_dog_starts_to_show_her_personality/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zkyme0/rescue_dog_starts_to_show_her_personality/,2470850,1670945831,0,,False,1670945845,1670945845,2022-12-13 15:37:11,,,,,,,
593,dogs,"I’m new to Reddit, so forgive me if I’m not up to par with how this should be done but I’m struggling emotionally.
My 1 year old Maltipom is allowed to roam free in our yard. She is never on a leash. We live in a community that has multiple dogs - some can be very aggressive. Everyone in our household is sensitive to this so whenever our gate opens she is placed either on a leash or in a crate for that brief period. Immediately the gate is shut, she is allowed to live freely.
This has been her whole life. At some point, my mother started to think “she might be trained to understand boundaries, I’m sure she gets it” and she thought my paranoia with the gate was overrated. For all intents and purposes, she’s highly intelligent and is well trained in all aspects.
Today, there was a lapse in communication and a member of the house opened the gate while she was off the leash. Immediately I heard the gate open I ran out like a reflex and just as well, I found she had run out. Literally in 5 seconds. My neighbour across the street was standing outside and upon spotting her caught her immediately - he feared she would run into some larger bulls that always manage to escape their enclosure.
I’m at a crossroads. Maybe I’m being too emotional. It feels inhuman to force her to stay against her will. I feel that it’s wrong to curb the curiosity associated with running away. I also can’t deal with the reality of her “running away”. I wonder if I’m a miserable owner and maybe she’s trying to escape me. I’ve given her everything I possibly can. She is treated as a member of the household and quite frankly she’s loved by everyone around her. I don’t know how she would be “bored” or what more exciting things I can do - she has every toy imaginable and she gets adequate exercise daily.
I want to have her rehomed or just open the gate and let her run free. Maybe there’s something better for her out there.

596,dogs,"We've had Kai since he was a 3 month old puppy. He's always been a generally good dog and we've been very blessed to have him but he has had some issues. He displayed food aggression and insecurity right off the bat. Most likely, the breeder fed all the puppies from a single trough and thus he feels he must protect his food. We've tried alleviating his food insecurity but we've only made minor progress. We have another dog (he's a smaller breed and is 14 years old, very fragile) and 2 cats, so Kai feels threatened by them and feels he must establish dominance. Thankfully we adapted to the food insecurity and his bouts of dominant behavior and it hasn't proved too problematic as we've tried to manage it.

However, things changed over the past few months as his occasional dominant and territorial behavior became much more consistent and he started acting much more aggressive. He's in late adolescence and seems to be changing accordingly. He's been growling a lot, guards his territory, his food, and seems to enter into moods where he becomes angry, irritated or upset. Strangely, despite his increase in aggressive and dominant behavior he still acts submissive to my family and I and is generally very friendly and sometimes when he is acting aggressive and dominant, he is simultaneously acting submissive, affectionate and penitent. He'll grow while giving his paw and acting nice, he even growls when rolling on his back in a submissive display. It's very odd. While he seems to be acting submissive and agreeable, he also seems on edge and angry or upset. He’s trying to be a good, friendly dog but he seems easily irritated or upset. It's as if he can't control his anger or aggression. | suspect it may be caused by a combination of changes in hormones and some underlying psychological condition. He’s about to enter into early adulthood and his changes in behavior may be linked to hormonal shifts. Also, by psychological condition, I refer to his food and territory aggression/insecurity. Interacting with him, l've noticed he seems like he's at the mercy of whatever is causing this aggression and irritability. He'll lower his head and neck, hold his ears down, give me his paw and have a sad, disconcerted look in his eye but simultaneously will be gently growling. It's as if he's upset and he's venting. He is a German Shepherd-Great Pyrenees mix and so he is a very large dog so we can’t have him hurting anyone or anything. Thankfully he never seriously injured anyone or anything. The worst he’s hurt us has been from playing. He loves to jump and roughhouse. It was an apparent personality trait from day one and we don’t have a problem with it really. Our main concern is the aggression and his potential to hurt someone or something.

He also displays this ""moody"" behavior with our cats. He frequently growls and barks at the cats, charges and tries to attack them whenever they tick him off (which is very often; thankfully cats are very fast and agile) but, on the flip-side sometimes he is playful and perfectly fine with them. With people he acts similarly. Most of the time, he is perfectly fine, friendly and well-behaved but sometimes he acts dominant and aggressive towards them. In these bouts of aggression, he'll seem consumed by the negative emotions for a brief period and he seems oblivious to the unacceptability of his behaviors, but when we step in to intervene, he immediately comes to his senses and acts friendly and submissive and apologetic, while simultaneously still displaying slightly-restrained signs of aggression (low growling, seeming nervous or on edge). What can I do to help him so he isn't so irritable and moody??

l've also been trying to show that I am not a threat to him and I don't want to be stern or dominant. I’m trying to show him that I’m trying to help him and he doesn’t have to worry about dominance. I've been trying to act slightly submissive and highly-empathetic when he is angry, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. I’m really not sure what the right thing to do is, hence why I’m posting this. Most recently he snapped at my face when I tried to lower my head and body to his level in an attempt to show him I mean him no harm. I was not hurt thankfully. He obviously interpreted my body language as intimidation and a threat and snapped. This was the first time I noticed he was triggered by such behavior. Luckily, the few times he's snapped at people and other animals, it has always been very restrained and no one was severely injured. Our older dog, Ben, was injured a few times as he is old and fragile and Kai’s subdued aggression carried enough force to hurt him causing Ben to whine and cry for a while. Thankfully Ben’s injuries were always minor, at worst, a very small cut from Kai’s claws or bite. We’ve become more cautious and conscientious towards Kai’s aggressive wariness of Ben and thankfully we’ve avoided any potential incidents. It is however quite stressful and taxing dealing with it, and I do not want him injuring anyone or another animal. We can be extremely careful but there is always room for error and danger. We are trying to train this behavior out of him but it is proving increasingly difficult. We discourage aggressive, unwanted behavior and encourage friendly, positive behavior. We use vocal cues, sounds, body language, play, attention and food as ways of conditioning his behavior, either reinforcing or discouraging a certain behavior. However, I do not think it is enough as his behavior isn’t really improving at a satisfactory rate. It is improving somewhat but we could do much better. I am researching on how to solve it but it seems not as straightforward as I thought. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

P.S. We did not crate him, we think maybe we should have. We really don’t know. He also was also never neutered and we may think it may be a factor to his increase in aggression. Lastly, I’m not advocating establishing dominance or aversive training, I am trying to figure out why he is acting so aggressive and why he is trying to be dominant and territorial towards us, other pets and animals, and people. It is very stressful and we don’t want Kai to be angry or annoyed, or for him to be discontented or upset in some way that we are not seeing or addressing.

 Full questionnaire: 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
Not first dog, some but limited experience training dogs. 2/5
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
Prefer to rescue.
3. Describe your ideal dog.  
Medium sized dog that doesn't require complete attention to keep entertained, but likes going on walks 1-2miles and doesn't mind the cold (we live in new england). A breed that's relatively short haired and doesn't shed too much so cleaning up after isn't too much of an issue. Hypoallergenic breeds - i suspect my partner may have some minor allergies to dander.
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
Our favourite now are the larger beagle, aussie shepherd, american foxhounds. Just like how they look and think they wouldn't bee too high energy.
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
Obedience on walks is the most important thing I want to train them - i want to be able to take them for hikes and long-ish walks without a leash.
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
No interest in competing or working at all.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
1-2 hours

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
30mins-1hours - walking, running, jogging.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
Regular brushing - once a week. Other grooming at home - not a problem. Should be able to pay a professional occasionally but not regularly.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?  
Medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
Low shedding, low barking. Slobber isn't an issue.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
Very important. I want to be able to train it to be obedient enough that I can give it the freedom to be off leash in my presence.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
Snuggly is preferable.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
Somewhere in the middle, a little more eager-to-please.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
Bark to inform on knocking; greet strangers with some enthusiasm.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
Yes - as long as I can train it out eventually.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
Shoe chewing.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
2-3 times a week, 4-6 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  
Partner &amp; I will split care responsibilities, but would like me to be the primary owner.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
Fish tank.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
Hopefully soon - yes.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
Rent for first few years - restrictions are small / medium sized dogs.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
New England, United States

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

606,dogs,"Hi, I know nothing about dogs, I've been tasked to take care of my mothers dog while she is away for a few days. I live with this dog so I know how it behaves normally but I dont take care of it.

I took it for a walk so it can poop and stuff. What happened tho is right after it pooped it stood there not moving.. I waited a good 5minutes just kind of talking to it but it wouldnt move or attempt to poop more or something. Seemed odd but pulling the leash he wouldnt move either so I ended up picking him up and bringing him inside since we werent that far. Its been 30minutes and he kind of stood in place barely walked at all, eventually went and sat down but he is reacting less? I think.. normally opening the door to the balcony he would run outside but he is not and also he seems to be shaking a little. It was very sudden as he behaved normally until that

607,dogs,"Sorry to vent, but I wanted a place to just put my thoughts. 

I lost my best friend last night. She was the most particular and prickliest dog you could ever meet. You knew if she liked you or not and was never shy about letting you know what she wanted. 

She was always a little lady with everything she did. Always seemed to have a sense of dignity in how she carried herself.

I'm going to miss her. She was there for my early adulthood - we got her after graduating from university and when starting my life as an adult. 

I didn't want her initially because dogs are a lot of work. But we bonded, especially the first night at home when she couldn't sleep because of how scared she was with the new home. Taking her, comforting her and sleeping together on the couch - who knew that would mark a beginning of how many naps together on the couch

She was there for all the bad times, but also the great times. My parents weren't really around or cared enough while I was going through some of the hardest challenges but she was always there. Her and her little smile telling me everything will be alright 

I thought we had more time. We were planning on buying a house with a yard so that she could have her own little space and maybe another dog because she looked lonely when I was working but that's never going to happen

Maybe this is just like her, always giving and never asking for anything. I recently marked my entry to being in my 30s a few days ago - it's as if she knew I needed to let go and start looking to my next chapter of my life and gave up so I could grow untethered

I'm going to miss you girl. I love you so much.

608,dogs,"Some background. My country has a BIG problem about stray dogs, they are practically everywhere. I always been an animal lover but something switched in me 5-7 years ago where I became overly sensitive about the matter.

I got a big property 5 minutes outside of the city where I keep my 2 dogs, one stray and 5 cats. Additionally I have 2 stray cats in my home permanently adopting them. The property I keep my dogs got 2-3 houses nearby (occupied) and people I asked about the shelter told me the noise of the various dogs might be a problem. 

I also bring additional food everyday I go to feed my dogs for potential stray dogs I find on my way there. It's kinda financially draining me since I'd say i spend more of 1/3 of my salary. 

Why I waited years to make this post? Because all the stray dogs I came across with, are either in packs and they are big dogs (I guess smaller dogs don't survive often)  which I guess subconsciously made me think they are not in extreme need of help but yesterday I came across a very small, cute dog, scared to death and pretty beat up from what I could see. I stopped but it was too scared to let me close. I didn't stop thinking about it. So here I am.

I know every country has its own laws when it comes to shelters and you are not familiar with mine. I'm asking for some help and advice about generic steps of helping dogs I guess. I got the space and I'm willing to leave my job and dedicate my life to helping stray animals. If you could tell me other useful subreddits, articles or content creators from who I can take some ideas, that would be amazing. Sorry for the essay.

Also im very proud of showing my small zoo so if you want to see them just ask :)",t2_dnjzgpnu,0,I want to open a shelter for stray dogs but I don't know the first thing about it.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zku5wm,True,ParadoxAngel3434,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zku5wm/i_want_to_open_a_shelter_for_stray_dogs_but_i/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zku5wm/i_want_to_open_a_shelter_for_stray_dogs_but_i/,2470798,1670933299,0,,False,1670933311,1670933311,2022-12-13 12:08:19,,,,,,,

620,dogs,"4yr old collie. Never had a issue before during winter. Over weekend she has occasionally stopped and lifted a paw or hops while lifting a back paw. 

My guess (after checking for injuries) was a combination of salt/grit and the subzero temperatures.

I have been using Mushers Secret for the last 2 days but she still sometimes limps. She hasn't limped while playing in the house or garden.

Has anyone had success with any boots that stay on and are good for icy cold protection. Or will I stick with the Mushers secret?

622,dogs,"So I’m currently looking after the dog mentioned in my previous post and after a few days I’m getting a bit fed up with some of the behaviour things that I’ve seen recently.


Before I list the things I’ll note that the family treats her like royalty as she gets treats for going to the toilet and sometimes for just coming back inside the house. Also if I eat lunch or dinner she has to have a share of it or a treat.
She gets a couple of the cats biscuits before bed just because. Double ups of treats happens quite often as the dad will give her treats but earlier in the day the mum had already given her the daily amount of treats.

So the behaviours that I’m wondering if I’d be able to change are:

•Attention seeking/Jealousy which leads to chasing/nipping of the other cats

•Eating behaviours-eating and finishing what’s in her food bowl before getting treats

Should I bother to try and change the behaviours if I’m only pet sitting for 6 weeks? 
Would clicker training work at all?

628,dogs,"Ok so in 2020 my ex gf decided she wanted to get a pitbull puppy, she was working from home at the time and we decided it was a good idea as she would be the one at home all day responsible for the dog. I was working two jobs at the time and going to school so I didn’t spend a lot of time with the dog but I still enjoyed having her around as she kept my ex company. Me and the dog got along fine or so I thought. Forward to this year 2022 my ex moved out to an apartment and she asked if I wanted to keep her  dog as I have my own home with a fenced yard or she would take it to the animal shelter since her landlord didn’t let her have the dog. I felt bad so my stupid ass decided to keep the dog not knowing the HUGE responsibility it actually is.  
She’s not horrible but she doesn’t listen to me at all, she is potty trained so that’s a plus. I still have a really busy schedule and don’t get to spend as much time with her and l feel really bad because I feel like a bad owner. Now the big issue is her NON STOP Barking when outside, she’ll bark literally at nothing and even howls it’s so annoying.
Last week my neighbors anonymously sent me a letter in the mail saying they’d call animal control if I don’t get the barking under control. Thing is when I’m home she rarely barks it seems more of an issue when I’m not home my roommate has confirmed this as well as my security cams. It seems like she only listened to my ex she had her trained but if I try to give her commands she ignores me or it kinda works but I have to constantly give her dog treats. 
She’s about 2 1/2 years old now and I feel horrible but I’ve been seriously thinking about taking her to the animal shelter, I feel like a failure and I probably won’t ever have a dog again. Part of me knows she deserves a better home but I’ve heard how pit bulls are rarely adopted and it makes me sad to think about her in a kennel alone.

I can’t really identify if there’s a specific leg she’s limping on, and she doesn’t seem to be in any pain (same energy level, appetite etc.). It just concerns me because it happens every single time without fail. I’ve taken her to the vet and they came to the conclusion that her legs probably just fell asleep after sleeping, but I still can’t help but worry. It just seems weird that her legs would fall asleep every single time she wakes up for the past month. This could be me being paranoid, as I had an amstaff puppy in the past who passed away from bone cancer. It started as a limp as well, and she was diagnosed when she was around 1 and a half years old. I just want some second opinions, vet bills are expensive but I still feel as if I should maybe get x-rays to be safe. Any advice would be appreciated!!",t2_ch0guiwr,0,"Puppy (8 months old) limps every time she wakes up, should i be worried?","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zkox3f,True,puppimae,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zkox3f/puppy_8_months_old_limps_every_time_she_wakes_up/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zkox3f/puppy_8_months_old_limps_every_time_she_wakes_up/,2470748,1670913771,0,,False,1670913784,1670913784,2022-12-13 06:42:51,,,,,,,
631,dogs,"Hi! I’m F15 and I love animals and completely educated about them except when it comes to dog pregnancy. Way back Oct 9th, my dad set her up with some pure black colored shih tzu because she's 5 years old, we want her to get pregnant so she can have a buddy at home since we don't take her out often because it's dangerous for her to go out since our street is dirty. My dog is a mixed breed of shih tzu and chihuahua. And I don't know if this is a false pregnancy but she mated twice. (and we had a shooter also to guarantee she'll get pregnant! she also mated when it was idk 9 days before or after her period or while she's on her period.) She shows signs that she's pregnant like nesting, loss of appetite but she's lively, she's very cuddlish. Sometimes she's extra hungry and sometimes she doesn't wanna eat but we checked and she's completely healthy so i think it's part of her pregnancy. She also has milk in her nipples and her nipples have changed ever since she mated. But the problem is.. it's past her due date. I computed, use a dog pregnancy calculator, so I don't really know why. Maybe there's a reason before I tell my dad to bring her to the vet.

1.) Do you worry about pyometra? How common is it for bitches to get pyo in your country? Is it standard to alter them at some age to prevent it, and if so, what age? When it does happen is it a panic moment or is it more of a ""Well, here we go. Time to take her to the vet and get this sorted out.""

2.) For those who live with intact males and females, do you worry about the welfare of your male when your female is in season? I ask because my only experience was the male howling, trembling, and trying to chew and scratch through the doors for a week. It was quite dramatic! I was shocked and I felt so, so bad for him. How do you help your males to make it through? Is it looked down on to keep males and females together?

637,dogs,"I am ready to take full responsibility, I am well aware of my mistakes but I really need guidance. 

Mistake #1 rushing in to getting a dog. The perfect puppy showed on my Facebook page, honestly thought it was meant to be. Vetted the breeder like crazy, no red flags. They did health testing, temperament testing, they were new but working with a really established breeder. I drive down to get the dog a week or so later. I meet the dog, she is perfect. Only flaw is she gets car sick. She is full of confidence. 

Mistake 2: I have one other dog and live with someone (my mother) who has 3 other dogs. One dog lacks confidence and resource guards, I know huge issue. She has history going after other animals but was fine with my first dog. I had a plan on keeping them separate, slowly introduce and so fourth. Do to exhaustion and stupidity along with sick brain the agro dog crossed paths with the puppy and bit her. We went to vet hospital. She is fine just a puncture wound. I feel absolutely terrible. 

Mistake 3: idk if this is a mistake but due to lack of sleep and slow building symptoms I am now sick. Need to still do a Covid test but in short I am physically and mentally wiped out. 

Mistake 4: my other dog adores her, problem is it’s in the obsession area. He is still crated and absolutely sobs when he can’t run around with her while he is in the crate and versus. 

Mistake 5: I did not account for all the other actual work I do for my moms dogs. I honest to god thought it was 50/50 she does morning shifts and I do night shifts. But recently I have had to take more responsibility as my mom has dove into other business ventures which means the only time she fully takes care of the dogs by herself is for an hour in the morning. The rest of the time it’s me after I get off work early afternoon. Letting out, feeding, interacting, playing, grooming, etc. now I have added a PUPPY into this and I’ve been completely overwhelmed. 

I spent a lot of money on this puppy, first well bred purebred dog of my life that I have paid for solely on my own. She is great, but with all these other things going on I feel like Im drowning. I know as time goes on it will get better, but right now im a mess and I need help.

My dog, Arlo, has been a bit sedentary lately. He recently finished steroid treatments due to an allergic reaction, so I'm trying to get him back into his exercise schedule. However, while he enjoys walking, it's usually quite a mild exercise and I was hoping to get him back into running since he loved doing so before. 

I think my main problem is just getting him motivated to run now. I've been slowly building up to doing longer sessions (and making sure that he only exercises on soft surfaces like grass), but he only enjoys running for a few minutes or when he is racing other dogs. Otherwise, he isn't motivated by any balls or treats.

658,dogs,"Im trying to decide on what breed dog we are going to be getting as 'our first dog.' We are mid 30s in a midsized house without a fence, pregnant and expecting in July and we have an almost 4 year old cat. I have been researching this to death but would like some advice from actual dog owners who may experience with these breeds. 

I've narrowed it down to; bernese mountain dog, bulldog, Boston terrier, and the basset hound.

I'm looking for a lower energy dog, semi easy to train, but most importantly is that they are generally good with children and cats. My concern with a higher energy dog is we probably won't have the time or energy with a newborn to really give it the amount of exercise and engagement it would need. Something a little lower energy like these 3 companion dogs or the Berner, from what I've ready they are pretty low energy versions of labs.

Other breeds I've looked into and maybe I've misread are Goldens, labs, Doberman, and frenchie. I think the golden or lab might be too much energy, the Doberman might not be safest with the cat or small children, and I've heard frenchies aren't very social with children or other animals. 

My main concerns with the 4 I've narrowed it down to are;

Berner: size, grooming, size
Bulldog: trainability, lack of playfulness with young child, training
Boston: too high energy for the cat (I've had 2 Bostons, they are a bit psycho when they want to play and have put off 3 other cats with their energy level)
Basset hound: health issues, baying

663,dogs,"Hi all, just need a sec to vent or perhaps ask if I need a perspective shift? A person just moved into my apartment community with their large golden doodle. (No breed hate, just helpful for size context)

Now, to preface, I have a small old man dog who has grown reactive with age. He barks and gets excited and sometimes acts tough when a big dog walks by. He’s also just territorial over me to a fault. I’m pretty mortified by his displays and quickly walk away so other people’s well behaved dogs can pee in peace (lol) and I give him verbal admonishment. (Though he’s stubborn and old and doesn’t GAF)

So look, I get dogs being dickheads. But this person lets their golden doodle send piercing big barks all across the community anytime someone walks by and they just…stand there and let the dog bark for however long. They don’t walk the other way, they force the other person to move THEIR dog away. I’ve encountered it and seen them do it to other people. No matter if I was somewhere first I ALWAYS move my dog away because he puts on such a show. And it’s not courteous to let him sit and holler at other dogs. 

It happened again outside my door as a neighbors dog walks by and again, they just stood there and let their dog bark over and over and over again. No admonishment, no pulling away, no nothing. 


Am I being overly critical? I dread anytime I come out to walk my dog and see them because no matter how far away we are the dog starts in.

Partner let the dog out the back door to go potty while I was gone, not realizing I had left the front gate open.

He finally goes to find the dog and upon entering the front yard, sees the gate open. The dog was sitting at the front door wagging his tail waiting to be let inside.  Heart attack avoided.

671,dogs,"(Originally posted in r/AskVet but that sub seems pretty dead.)

Our dog, Hollywood, is a gorgeous two-year-old Golden Retriever. She is a great doggo in every way, but...

A few weeks ago she started staring at the floor and walls. I mean really staring, like for several minutes she just sits there staring at the faintest shadows or light artifacts. As I'm typing this, she is staring at a patch of light from the sun through a window. In a little bit she'll move on to the next shadow or patch of light and do the same thing. She takes breaks from doing this but is easily drawn back.

She gets two walks per day, has a big back yard, and gets plenty of attention/affection from my wife and I and our kids.

She seems to have a high prey drive - she has killed several mice in our back yard, a rabbit, and a groundhog. She chases squirrels and skunks, even though she's been sprayed twice.

Our vet said that she's probably bored or anxious, but I wanted a second opinion, because this feels more serious than that. She comes from a reputable breeder and is gentle, obedient, and seems like a happy pup in general.

It's extremely bizarre to watch her do this, so hoping someone has experience dealing with this, and thanks in advance for any advice.

Here she is staring at a light patch. She does the same thing with shadows when the room is darker.

682,dogs,"Background: The dog we have was found abandoned and we took her in. We have a few kids, one other dog, and 3 weeks ago we have two new kittens. We have never really considered her ""reactive"" or ""aggressive"" except with treats/food if the other dog gets close. And that would only happen sometimes. Lately, in the last 6 months or so she has gotten a lot worse and starts fights seemingly randomly with our other dog. We have noticed any triggers that might have caused them. Not only have we had issues in the last 6 months but things have also gotten worse when we got two new kittens 3 weeks ago. We think our dog is scared of them and we keep them separated and let them around each other (supervised) once per day. 

Help: Today was the worst however. My dog attacked our other dog, enough to cause a deep puncture wound and shed blood. As my son was pulling her away, she apparently turned around and bite my sons leg (my wife is taking him to the doctor's now to see if he needs stitches). When I was little we put our dog down because it attacked and killed a neighbor's dog. We have know what we are suppose to do and don't want to make an emotional decision. Was this a one-off thing, will it happen again? We don't want to have to re-home her or put her down but obviously our children's safety is our #1 priority.

688,dogs,"

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Essentially yes, had a dog when I was a kid but she was a rescue and we didn't have her long. I have lived with dogs too but I wasn't the owner/sole care provider

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, keeping an open mind

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* High energy, enjoys walks and exercise, good with kids

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I was looking into border collies because of their energy and had been told they're good with kids but we're open. I like the idea of a beagle or a Labrador too, as long as they're active and get along with the kids that's good with us.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This isn't something I've really thought about, probably things that are mentally stimulating as my eldest needs lots of stimulation and keeping his brain busy he'd like to do a lot with the dog 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I don't think so and none

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I'd say 3-4hrs but possibly more it would totally depend on the dog we're willing to put in what's necessary 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Regular long walks, hill walking, going to the woods, we have a big back garden too 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Willing to learn but also live around the corner from a reputable groomer 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small or medium, lean more towards medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Next door neighbour has a GSD that barks a lot and though we don't mind we'd prefer to have a dog that didn't bark as much, slobber I'd rather avoid and shedding we don't mind

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not overly important but if they need the exercise we'd make it a priority and train appropriately

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I think a good balance of both but my kids are affectionate with animals so probably more snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Again a good balance of both would be good

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Prefer them not to bark or jump at them, we do have an internal door before the front door though to avoid this. Be nice if they greeted them with curiosity (I think that's the word I mean) rather than as a danger 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* if I have to then yes but preferably they wouldn't be

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think aggressiveness is one maybe overly anxious too? 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Currently I'm in education 3 days a week for 7-8hrs but they'd only be alone for 3hrs then I'd come home for break and away for 3hrs again on those 3 days - if I couldn't make it back we'd have a dog walker. This could potentially only be 2 days a week as my husband usually gets one of the days I'm away off

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Myself, my husband and my 4yo will all be taking care of the dog but I will be the one who does the bulk of the care/training, husband and 4yo on hand for playing and training and other exercise

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a very elderly cat but she's not got long left unfortunately, we won't be looking to get a dog until April/spring 2023 so there's a chance we won't have the cat anymore 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, 4 year old (closer to 5 by time we intend on getting dog) and 1 year old (again closer to 2 by time we intend on getting dog)

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Currently rent, no restrictions  

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK and Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, Fila Brasileiro are the banned dogs I found [here](https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer can reach 20 degrees (Celsius), sometimes higher. Winter as low as -7 degrees (Celsius)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We're happy to take any and all advice, obviously we're in the UK so be good to hear from other UK people on how to go about getting a dog/where to look/what to look out for. We're not getting one straight away and giving ourselves plenty of time to get this right!

Dog, Great Pyrenees/golden retriever mix
- 86 lbs
- age: 9
- neutered 
- has ichthyosis, seborrhea, severe environmental and food allergies. 
- constant sneezing, coughing, dry heaving, gagging. 

Sorry, I know this is a long post. 

Ive been dealing with my dogs allergies the past several months and nothing I’m doing for him seems to be working. I adopted him in May of this year. His skin is primarily affected by allergies. He’s diagnosed with seborrhea and ichthyosis. His seborrhea was horrible when I first adopted him. It was to the point that he had big open sores and was losing fur all over his body. It looked like mange. I’ve taken him to a vet, where mange was ruled out w/a skin scrape and was told it’s part of his allergies. He’s had cytopoint injections and had apoquel off and on since. His fur has all grown back, but the smell of seborrhea still lingers. Dandruff and dry scaly skin is still present. I bathe him with a medicated allergy shampoo but the smell comes back a few hours later. 

He’s always super congested and sneezes often. He also has a deep, dry cough that results in him gagging/dry heaving. Nothing ever comes up from the heaving. His sneezing and congestion is better when I give him Benadryl, but the cough still persists. This has been brought up to my vet several times, and I always get the same response. “Part of allergies or kennel cough”. I really don’t think it’s kennel cough. I don’t know if this is a food allergy that I’m not handling well or if it’s something more serious. He’s had blood work done, thyroid issues ruled out. My vet also ruled out any heart disease. I don’t have any good history of his symptoms, other than the surrendering party stating that “he has allergies and is on a grain free diet”. I’ve kept him on a grain free diet. Im going to start him on a probiotic tomorrow. 

I would just like some advice or help with this. I can’t afford another $400 vet visit at this time. What can I do to help with the gagging, sneezing, and seborrhea?

692,dogs,"So , my family and I recently got three dogs. Two came from one owner and the other one came from a different owner. Neither of which are related. We got the one boy first around a week ago and he’s a small puppy barely 10 weeks chihuahua with lots of playful energy. Then a week later we picked up two girl puppy chihuahuas, at first the owners were unsure of when they were born so their behavior might be due to their age but since we’re unsure of how old they are we don’t know. The owners claimed they were born around August but later claimed it was around October. Anyways, when we picked up the girls we could see the owners had a lot of chihuahuas and they had the three puppies in a box with towels as blankets. At first glance when we picked up the two girls they were fine and seemed very calm not very scared. However it’s when we got home their behavior changed. They didn’t react much in the car which is important to note, they mostly laid down on my lap and cuddled. We’ve noticed that the tan one (the smaller sized one) is pretty calm and while she shows signs of fear or stress she doesn’t show them as much as her sister. The other dog , she’s brown and tan, will hide under blankets, behind tables and underneath couches. She will avoid eye contact and shake and when we try to pick her up she freaks out and starts clinging to her bed. We’ve noticed the two girls get along well with our other boy puppy, but they seem scared of us. We’ve been trying everything we can to calm them down or get them to show more affection or different moods but for the most part they seem quite sad and non-expressive. Is this normal puppy behavior or normal behavior for puppies when they get used to new homes and new people? We just don’t know because we’ve never had these problems with our two previous puppies.

We have a 1 year old mutt that injured his back leg over the weekend when he slipped on some ice while playing. He would not put weight on it and appeared to be in a lot of pain so took him to the emergency vet. They said it seemed like a partial ACL tear and very unlikely to be a break so we didn’t get X-rays. Gave a weeks worth of carprofen and gabapentin for pain. 

We have a follow up with his regular vet but can’t get in for another 4 days. Today is 3 days post-injury and he is doing much better, still limping but able to get around and not whining, doesn’t seem to be in a lot of pain. Eating, drinking, pooping all normal. We’ve kept him on strict rest only going outside on a leash for bathroom breaks. 

My question: should we continue giving him the meds? If he doesn’t seem to be in pain, is it better for him to stay off the meds so we can monitor his progress? Or is it better to keep him on the meds to ward off any leftover inflammation? I’m worried if he’s drugged up he might get a little too confident and injure himself worse when I’m not looking (he’s very high energy).

702,dogs,"first, i have tried googling it. i don't think google really understands what i'm trying to describe.

so most of the time when i pet my dog, she starts nibbling/chewing whatever is in front of her. usually fabric but sometimes skin (which hurts). i usually stop petting her if she keeps doing it because i don't know what it means, and then she stops doing it soon after i stop petting her.

it only really happens to me, and i'm the one who really pets her unprovoked (my dad pets her when she jumps up on him, my sibling doesn't really care for the dog, and my mother only pets her when she jumps up on her too. i pet her when she jumps up on me and i also will go up to her and pet her.)

the chewing doesn't do any damage. she's not trying to do damage. she just stuffs her nose into the thing and nibbles/chews with her front teeth.

does that mean she wants me to stop petting her? that's what i've been assuming. what does it mean?",t2_e9jk8l01,0,why does my dog start chewing stuff when i pet her?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zkas1z,True,moooshroomcow,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zkas1z/why_does_my_dog_start_chewing_stuff_when_i_pet_her/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zkas1z/why_does_my_dog_start_chewing_stuff_when_i_pet_her/,2470550,1670877706,0,,False,1670877717,1670877717,2022-12-12 20:41:46,,,,,,,

I have an 18 month old Brittany boy and he has the worst pee aim of any dog I've ever met.
I know people joke that blokes can't aim when they wee but he really takes the cake.

He insists on having a target. He has to have something vertical to (attempt to) wee on rather than squatting on the grass. He's neutered but we did it when he was about 10~11months so I guess marking had already instilled itself as a habit by then.
This wouldn't be such a problem if 90% of the stream didnt miss the target completely.
He doesn't even do anything as convenient as just hitting the ground. No he has to hit the back  of his legs, staining his beautiful white socks yellow.
This then causes them to itch something fierce so we always have to wipe his feet off after he's gone for a wee.

He has no issues with mobility, he's a very active dog who loves running and his vet was fawning over his muscle tone on his last visit
His parents were both hunting dogs of good stock with no health issues and we've closely monitored for any signs of hip dysplasia

My dog started acting weird out of nowhere yesterday and refused a treat which he would never do, and instead just sat with me looking sad. then i noticed he was mildly shaking so I told him to get up so I can check him out and he started shaking more..but was walking/running fast like nothing was wrong in that aspect. he attempted to squat outside to poop for like 3 seconds and then just stopped so I assumed he maybe had pain in that position or something. immediately took him to the vet after that because he was still shaking and panting a bit much..when I got to the vet he seemed worse..didnt wanna walk much..was just standing in an odd posture..kind of crouched over and its as if he was half standing half sitting..squating with his back legs but not enough to sit..and at one point he yelped loudly when he got up suddenly to look at someone coming in. they did xrays and gave him a pain injection. all that for $1600 and nothing was found broken or that would indicate injury in xrays. they said they had no idea what could be wrong and wanted to do diagnostic tests but even then, they wouldnt be able to prescribe pain meds so i thought..whats the point of paying twice as much for ER prices then..so I took him home and plan to take him to his regular vet to continue searching for what has him feeling badly. today, he is just laying around..refusing snacks, and hiding a bit, but not crying or yelping. any ideas why a young dog would suddenly act this way?!",t2_udrslca2,0,dog advice/medical advice please!!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zk8r6o,True,designed_destination,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zk8r6o/dog_advicemedical_advice_please/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zk8r6o/dog_advicemedical_advice_please/,2470525,1670873302,0,,False,1670873314,1670873315,2022-12-12 19:28:22,,,,,,,
710,dogs,"Hi everyone, I'll try to lay everything out that I'm having issues with in this post. I guess I just need some advice. A little background, I had a dog from when i was 13 until 25. I had to put him to sleep due to osteosarcoma. It's been about 6 years now since I put him to asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a place in my life where I'm reasonably confident that I would be able to take care of a dog again. So I have been looking at pet shelters for the past 4 months and I finally found one that caught my eye. She is an 8 month old GSD mix. So I went to the shelter over the weekend met her and she was absolutely perfect. Fantastic temperment and was just all over me.

My problem is that I have been having anxiety and panic attacks whenever I have tried to pick her up. I think it's because I felt so helpless with my last dog. So I have called the shelter twice now to tell them I couldn't move forward with the adoption. While I do feel some relief that I called and said that I can't adopt her. I feel like crap because the dog was perfect for me and I really think we would be good for each other.

711,dogs,"We just introduced a new dog into our home! She is from a rescue and is 5 years old. Our resident dog is 2. The new dog has been with us for three days so far. 

We introduced Porsha (new dog) and Frankie (resident dog) outside they seemed calm and took walks together without incident. 

The first incident happened when Frankie had a bully stick and I let Porsha out of my room without thinking. She took it from him and growled and had a small tiff with no one getting hurt. I think Porsha is resource guarding..she's very underweight and I hope with time she would understand she doesn't have to guard anymore when she gets the nutrition she needs and fills out and starts to understand she will reliably be fed. Frankie is also growling/resource guarding whenever she gets near him when he is holding a toy. 

Just now, I was sitting in the floor with frankie and Porsha and frankie's mom, and frankie was sniffing porsha and getting to know her. She then growled and bared her teeth at him, and when he tried to come closer she did it more intensely. She was on my lap at this point, so I picked her up and took her back to her/my room.

She's friendly with dogs on the street and greets any dogs with a shy confidence. It's just with Frankie in the home if there's food involved or if she feels threatened i guess?

716,dogs,"Hello! I rescued my dog at the end of April this year. He is a mix of Canaan, Sloughi, Saluki,  and others and then 50% Siberian Husky on his dad's side. He's super energetic and has been stubborn to train. Place is his best command,  recall is mostly OK,  and we're working on impulse control. 

I'll be going to my mom's and dad's separately on Christmas day. My mom has a small dog who is sick and doesn't like to play and a cat he tries to chase and my dad has a small dog who doesn't want to play and a puppy who wants to play and my dog gets so excited over. 

I've been working on place and stay multiple times a day working on duration and distance and slowly adding distractions. We're trying to work on leave it and drop a bit more as well. I brought him to my mom's and practiced place without big distractions, and he was fine. Placed and stayed for minutes and I could walk around and go out of sight and even outside. I tried to move my nephews toys around and keep him in place and that's too much of a distraction. 

I only have a few weeks until Christmas, and he LOVES to tear paper so this will be a huge distraction for him. I'll be bringing a mat he's familiar with so he really understands that that is his place. And I know I could leave him home but I'll be gone most of the day, and my mom and step mom have gifts for him. My mom is making him a few boxes filled with paper and treats for him to rip up in the kitchen. 

Does anyone have other tips on how I can train him a bit faster or other methods I could try. I've had him on a leash and saying ""ah ah"" when he tries to go after the toy. A big ""yes"" as my marker word and treats when he chooses to stay on the place. I always start from basics in a new location with just him getting in and off of the place and building.

721,dogs,"I wasn't sure which subreddit to post this in, but I thought that some of you may have gone through something similar. 

My friend adopted a dog in May of this year. She had never owned a dog before, but her husband had. However, they adopted a German Shepherd/Husky mix (their best guess, I would say it's semi-accurate) and neither of them have had experience with those breeds. The dog was a few pounds underweight when they adopted her, but I have seen recent photos and it looks like she has lost a lot more weight. They said that she was a little picky with food, but they apparently found one that she really likes (and I can confirm that because I've dogsat and fed her while I was there). Based on what I know about my friend and her husband, I feel like they are either intentionally feeding her less than she needs to make the bag of dog food last longer, or they just didn't bother to check how much she needs to eat. 

My friend and her husband are going through a divorce, so my friend has moved out. Her husband works a full time job, so the dog sits at home alone for most of the day. When he is home, she only really gets to go out to potty and for a short walk. She never gets to run around and I can tell that she has tons of energy and that running around would be good for her. My friend has also locked her in her crate for hours in the past just because the dog was 'being annoying' or because she threw up/had an accident in the house. I told her that wasn't a good idea, especially since they lock her in the crate at night and it wouldn't be a good idea for the dog to associate being in the crate with being punished. 

Thankfully, they have decided to find a foster for the dog. My friend wants to take her back next year around June/July when she actually has her own apartment/house (she has been staying with another friend). However, I feel like they should find someone to take the dog permanently instead. The dog hasn't been cared for and I feel like those breeds specifically were not a good fit for them, for multiple reasons. I know my friend wouldn't take the dog for walks or train her and the dog would still be home alone for most of the day. 

I normally don't tell my friends what they should/shouldn't do, but I feel like I should because a dog is involved. I've been concerned for the dog ever since they adopted her and multiple people have agreed with me in that they should permanently rehome her. I just have no idea what to say or how to say it. I don't care if it damages our friendship. I really just want the dog to have a good home where she's taken care of, healthy, and her needs are met.",t2_3nijh9fd,0,How do you tell someone that they shouldn't own a dog?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zk5yva,True,richestotheconjurer,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zk5yva/how_do_you_tell_someone_that_they_shouldnt_own_a/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zk5yva/how_do_you_tell_someone_that_they_shouldnt_own_a/,2470492,1670867393,0,,False,1670867411,1670867412,2022-12-12 17:49:53,,,,,,,

725,dogs,"My roommate some who I consider a good mate she got a new puppy maybe 8 months ago now. The problem is that she isn't spending enough time with her dog in my opinion and is punishing the dog for misbehaviouring even though its just an energetic puppy with too much energy.

In the morning she'll wake up feed and let the dog in the small backgarden for about 5 minutes then go to work. She will get back feed him again and on the rare occasion take him for a 20 minute lap around the neighbourhood. Then come home and spent the rest of the night upstairs.

Now I work from home so I do my bits for the puppy like playing during my lunch break but it's not fair on me or the pup. My other roommates have already confronted her about it and for maybe a week she took the pup out twice a day. And to noone surprise all the misbehaving and destructive behaviours went away. I tried dropping hints of wow look how chill the dog is where did you walk him but I guess it didn't stick because she went back to her old ways.

On top of all that she posts pics on social media displaying her as the best dog mum and whenever her friends are over they spent all the time with the pup. She also keeps saying everyone said getting a pup was a bad idea but I don't regret it one bit.......

727,dogs,"About 4 weeks ago I noticed my 4yo lab-pit wasn’t putting weight on one of her hind legs after a morning walk. Nothing notable happened on the walk, and she didn’t react at all to my touching around the leg/ thigh so I just rested her for a couple of days, and she appeared to be fine.

Maybe two weeks after, I noticed it again, and again, no preceding incident or apparent pain. I rested her for a bit longer this time, and again, she stopped limping pretty soon after. I gradually added just a little bit of walking this time, over the course of a week or so, and everything was ok… so after a few more days I (foolishly) let her off leash because she was raring to do some zoomies.

728,dogs,"This might be long-winded and for that, I apologize, but I’m feeling super anxious and would love some support. 

My sweet girl Winnie is five years old and has always been the most loving — but also rambunctious — little pup. She eats a pretty solid, steady diet: Royal Canin food, interspersed with treats (typically Real Meat jerky treats or Gibson’s, recently some treats from bark box) or fresh fruit (mostly banana, but to the tiniest size possible because if it’s too big she will spit it out and stare at me like I’m a dope). On Friday night, she got a hold of a Chick-fil-A French fry, which may have sent her on a spiral, or just triggered something underlying. 

On Saturday morning, she vomited. Because of who she is as a dog, she takes her one vomit and kinda trails it around the floor in a few spots to make sure I definitely see it happened. No big deal, clean it up and don’t think anything of it. Until I notice she also hasn’t eaten her food, and vomits again a few hours later. Then, she has diarrhea. Uh oh. After two cycles of diarrhea — one of which had some red twinge to it — and her second vomit, she goes after her dental treat to eat it and I think hey, cool, she’s all good! This is when I put together that she had gotten to a fry the night before and start feeling relieved that this wasn’t out of the blue. Despite seeming a little more tired, she was still behaving similarly, playing around with her toys and being my shadow. 

Until we had just settled into bed, and she jumps off the bed to go vomit again. This time, the vomit has red specks in it. Queue absolute meltdown. I call the emergency vet, explain the situation, and check her gums per their prompting. They advise she’s fine to get through the night unless she vomits again, withhold food and water for the night, and in the morning give her some boiled chicken and see how she holds it down. She made it through the night and took the boiled chicken, but I still felt nervous (and had googled everything until I went completely in a downward spiral) so I decided to take her to the vet. 

At the vet, she was fine (according to them). A bit tender when they touched her stomach, though they also noted she may have been nervous. She was still wagging her tail and wanting to be pet and playing around when prompted, and hasn’t thrown up. They gave me a plethora of options (as well as a cost breakdown and what they absolutely recommended and what they said would be nice but not totally necessary at that point, which I appreciated). I opted in for most of it; she was dehydrated so they gave her fluids, as well as treatment for a stomach ulcer (in case the red specks were from an ulcer) and anti-nausea medication, a fecal test (still incomplete as she has yet to poop again), and complete blood panel. She still seemed a touch lethargic when we got home but by the end of the night, she was playing around again and acting more like herself. Through the course of the day, she had eaten an entire chicken breast (slowly and in increments of course) and had even voluntarily drank some water. 

Despite feeling a little more relieved, I’m back to feeling nervous. She’s still lethargic today, only played a little this morning before eating more chicken breast. She still hasn’t pooped, and we will be waiting for blood work results to ensure something more serious isn’t at okay here. 

I’m so grateful for her vet, and I really appreciated their professional opinion that she probably just ate something bad and got an ulcer trying to expel it, but I truly regret having googled her symptoms because all I can think about are the many things I saw online that could be wrong. Because she hasn’t immediately snapped back to perfectly normal, I feel like any one of those internet cases could be hers, and I’m terrified. This beautiful little girl has turned my grief to grace and I hate that she isn’t well and that there isn’t much I can do about it. It also feels like I’m “on hold”, waiting to see if a) she pukes again because the anti-nausea meds they gave her yesterday would’ve worn off by now and b) there is something underlying that may have caused this. 

As much as I’d love support I’d also love to offer advice: if anything is wrong with your dog, stay off the internet.

Let's call them Masta1 and Masta2. **Both come from a shelter and were abandoned multiple times** until I re-homed them.

Masta1 is the Lab mix and, *when Masta2 is aggressive towards other dogs*, attacks (pins down) Masta2 in a strange but appreciated display of ""wanting to maintain the peace"".

Masta2 is the Malinois mix and will run towards anything on sight if left to his own devices, but NOT bite. Instead, he wants to play 'rough'. Being 50kg, he can and *has accidentally injured both dogs and humans* in the past.  


**The new puppies**

The new puppies, let's call them Pei1 and Pei2, are both pure breed 9 weeks Sharpeis. They had their first vax, and we were told by the vet to immediately socialize them with both Mastadors. I am very well aware of Sharpei socialization issues because I used to own one that sadly passed away recently. He was always attacking other dogs, running towards them and receiving a beating because he didn't know how to fight, only to harrass.  


**Current setup**

We have isolated a room for the puppies and placed a metal crate. We introduced the puppies to the mastadors by letting the mastadors in the room with the puppies in the closed crate and being very careful and observant at all times.

Masta1 (the ""wise"" one) - *looks at them with seemingly ""caring eyes"" and lies down to observe them.*

Masta 2 (the malinois cross) - **drools like he's starting at dinner**. He doesn't growl or attack the cage, but *he's clearly very excited*. He wags his tail, but the drool worries me. It's like that scene in Alien with Sigourney holding her breath :)   


**The Question**

How should I go about introducing those four? I thought about potential scenarios. For example, I could take the ""calmer"" Masta 1 to the room, open the cage, and have 2 people help me monitor the situation and ensure he doesn't hurt the puppies in any way. If that goes well, I could repeat the process with the second Mastador. Both could be placed on harnesses with hard fixed points so the puppies could go to them *but not the other way around.* 

But, ultimately, **I know very little about this situation** as I never really properly socialized my previous Sharpei puppy. I *rely on this community to guide me through the potential steps*, specifically:  


* methods to introduce the puppies safely
* timing (when to introduce the puppies safely)

745,dogs,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I've had at least two dogs living with me at the same time my entire life. Most were obtained as puppies from a shelter and lived long lives. I am currently the owner of two dogs and looking for a third and final companion at the moment.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Preferred Rescue

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Has a size range from Medium to Giant. A very protective, yet family friendly dog to protect us from potential threats. (Currently one dog is skiddish, and the other is way too friendly to strangers.) High energy isn't that big of an issue as we have a dog that can literally run all day so having a breed to compliment her energy level while responding to commands if they start to get too wild haha. Shedding isn't a big deal at all, and at least one person will be home most of the time. Longest he/she will ever be left alone for would be 8 hours.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My fiance has been a life-long sucker for German Shepherds. That's actually the only breed she's ever grown up with until we got together. One of our dogs in the present is a mixed German Shepherd.

* A Husky has been one of the top on our list. Beautiful dogs that would adapt to our environment easily. We've always wanted a husky but not sure if that would be the ideal choice or not.

* A Boxer is one that I never thought I would fall in love with. Until I owned one. I loved the way she would communicate and talk back to you and made the perfect road companion. Unfortunately she came down with health issues when she was almost 9.

* Last but not least, an Australian Kelpie is another one we're interested in. We have a mixed Kelpie and boy are they beautiful dogs. Really smart and fast and she's just an amazing companion.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands like sit, lay, stay, etc. The most advanced one would maybe be roll over 😂

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Doesn't need to be sporty whatsoever. We'll be doing some basic one mile walks on the occasion but we do have a large yard. About an acre for them to run about.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* General interaction will be quite a bit per day. Petting, roughhousing, and general communication indoors for a good hour per day at the very least. Outdoors in our large yard supervised for an hour to a good portion of the entire day depending on the weather. Since one of us is usually home we can devote a lot of time training if needed.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* As far as one on one time with him/her it will be at least half hour a day depending on what we have going on around the household and family. My fiance loves to play fetch with them though! No dog park because we live out in the country.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Most grooming needs will be taken care of a vet. We have a brush at home and I enjoy doing that so that's not an issue.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to Giant

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding- anything from hypoallergenic to shedding like crazy it doesn't matter to us. Barking- kept minimal most times unless there's somebody in the driveway. Slobber- would be very nice to keep that at a minimum.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Our yard is fenced in and we let them run off leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly and empathetic when we're emotional from a long day but not as much when we have a nice, normal day.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* No preference here. As long as they obey most of the time.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Let the barking erupt if there's someone in the yard. As far as greeting goes, I want to train them to know when a person is okay and when they are not.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* We have done this before. Not currently, but in the past with our Boxer and Blue Heeler. It definitely isn't something we would like to go through again.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Eating everything in sight. We can manage some chewing behaviors but we are busy even just at home so our future dog would be amazing if they didn't try to eat something that would potentially harm them.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* One weekend day into the city for a shopping trip for about 8 hours tops.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* They feel the same way as me. Everybody will contribute caring for the dogs.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 1- middle aged male cat, 1- Mixed Australian Kelpie (5 years), 1- Mixed GSD (3 years), and if we're being ultra specific we have two fish tanks as well.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. My fiance and I have a baby who's turning 9 months. My parents who also live here have their other grandchildren visit about once a week and they are 8-13 years of age.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own our property so no restrictions here.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in Montana, United States.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter- ~20°F but can reach just below zero Summer- ~65° but can get up to 100° in rare cases.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

747,dogs,"Long post ahead. Looking for some advice or maybe affirmation here - we’d been a two dog household for over a decade. This year (which will forever live in my mind as the Worst Year Ever), we lost our 13 year old GSD in May. To help with our surviving pup’s loneliness, we adopted a 3month old. Then we lost our 10YO girl suddenly and unexpectedly in November. We are left with our now 7month old newest addition. 

My problem is this: I don’t know if i have it in my heart to have two dogs again. The sudden and traumatic loss of Eva has really rocked me and while I’m grateful we have Poe (the puppy) to keep us grounded, I really can’t see having a second dog anymore. Emotional implications aside, I’m finding that having a single dog has so many other benefits (easier to just pick up and go somewhere / take one dog out, walks are easier, trips to the vet, food and med expenses are halved etc). 

But Poe is so dog friendly it’s ridiculous. He absolutely adored Eva Myron day one, and I’m struggling with the idea that he doesn’t want to be an only dog? Or would benefit from a companion. I’m pouring all my energy into meeting his needs - daily walks and play, doggy day care twice a week, trips to the dog park and an in home trainer (he’s a giant breed and I want to make sure he has good manners). I just feel this weird guilt that he had a 24/7 friend and now he…doesn’t. Eva tolerated him, they didn’t play or cuddle 24/7 but they did play daily, and just her being there seemed to make him happy. Or maybe I’m projecting and because I miss her like crazy. 

Anyway. I guess what I’m trying to ask is, do you ever think your single dog is lonely? Do you feel guilty that they don’t have a friend? Or is it normal and okay to just have one?",t2_qx6wm,0,Single-dog homes - loneliness?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zk0w8e,True,lizsabby,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zk0w8e/singledog_homes_loneliness/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zk0w8e/singledog_homes_loneliness/,2470433,1670856073,0,,False,1670856083,1670856084,2022-12-12 14:41:13,,,,,,,

750,dogs,"Just like the title said, my now roommate has two dogs which I’ve done research they are  Dachshunds. Which apparently barks alot since I’ve moved in last weekend. They bark at every thing. I might can understand they bark when someone is at the door or whatever but in the morning or when I wake up, if I’m in my room they just bark and run to the door. I’m not a loud person. I’m very quiet and stay to myself. I told this lady that I was very quiet and would like the same but I didn’t have any idea that those dogs were like that. I’ve never lived with a dog but i had relatives that have dogs and they don’t near bark so loud like the dachshunds.

I'm told I actually kick or move alot in my sleep so I was a little worried that I hurt the guy actually. So, I get up, turn on my phone, and my dog gets off the bed -- honestly think the shaking was him trying to get ready to leap off the bed but being a little unsure of how to do so (especially since my bed is veryyy low to the ground). He's still in my room right now, he's just now sleeping on the floor on top of some clothes.

Is he alright? I'm definitely not complaining, but I don't get why he wanted to sleep in my room, he's much closer with my parents and typically sleeps in their room. The door to their room is still open and so is mine just in case he wants to leave. Maybe its the fact that my room is the warmest tbh, but I don't know, he has a nice warm bed in my parents' room.

\*first time poster and not native english\*

I need some advice on my boyfriends dog. We currently live together and my boyfriend decided to adopt a (neglected) dog, diddn't seem like a bad idea at the time... the first month the dog was fine, diddn't really break anything on purpose. in the second month she found out where the trashcan was and decided to scatter the contents around the house twice a day. we placed a toddler gate so she can't reach it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

now she trashes and demolishes everything else in the house and we can't even leave the room for 2 minutes without her breaking something. keep in mind we only have the dog for 2.5 month now and I'm not getting any sleep, stress levels are rising and I cannot keep replacing all the furniture...

&amp;#x200B;

since 3 weeks we are keeping her in a bench, sounds cruel but it seems like she needs that when we aren't  in the same room.

786,dogs,"I got my most recent dog from my local SPCA almost two years ago. She's a wonder and I'm so glad we met/I get to have her. At the shelter they'd said she was taken out of a hoarder's house and had no other information. Sometimes I check the SPCA website (a habit I need to break, tbh) and I see dogs that look a lot like her, sometimes prompting a visit, but I've never really thought they were related.

A few weeks ago though, this new dog shows up on their site. And it's her. She's a mix of Dalmatian and other things, and the picture is just a blockier, male version of her. Apparently, his old owner couldn't keep up with him and sent him back, and they said the owner before that one had a housing issue which is how he landed there in the first place. 

I went to visit. He's so much like her, it's crazy. If I could, I would foster him, but they only allow sick/recovering dogs to be fostered. I wanted to know if I could offer up my email to whoever adopted him to see if they'd want to do a playdate sometime, though even saying it out loud sounds ridiculous. I think I'm just really psyched about finding a sib (I picked my first dog from a litter with other people but didn't think to exchange info with any of the other new owners- that was over 10 years ago), but tbh his new owners could be crazy people or might try to abandon him with me if they have no idea what they're doing.

789,dogs,"After a very stressful and expensive night I am looking for some insight. 

Context: I've worked from home since October 2019, except occasional days in office. In my opinion the dogs (one M, one F, miniature dachshunds, 8 years) are generally well behaved.  Though they are smart and capable of getting into trouble, the most that happens is they pull laundry off the bench and sleep in it when we aren't home.  They bark at noises but are mostly controllable. (The girl sometimes loses her mind at overnight sounds but relaxes when she realizes it is my husband). They don't beg for food. The boy can be persistent some of the time about being picked up, but other times he is completely fine alone. 

Incident: Tonight I went to the gym.  I was not gone longer than 45 minutes.  I come back and the bathroom garbage has been destroyed, and 3 tampons are missing.  Rush the dogs to the vet to induce vomiting and the boy had swallowed all three.

Talked to the breeder about it and she insists that they are spoiled and is isn't anxiety.  She tells me they one chewed up electrical wires and for the life of me i don't remember. I think this seems like separation anxiety.  Though I'm not sure why such a short absence caused such trouble.  We have left them as long as 12 hrs before and they are always fine. 

Breeder suggests we lock them in a cage anytime we are not home.  She thinks that they will end up dead if not.  There was one incident last year where we locked up the girl (she gets anxious in new places, at the time we were new to our home) and ended up barking and screeching so much we got a noise complaint.  Has not happened since, but she had done this before. Suggests a bark collar. 

Talked to husband and while he agrees they are spoiled (but improving), he thinks the cage is totally unnecessary.  He agrees that they don't act up and that we can solve the issue simply by closing the bathroom door, which was my first thought too.  We don't think there is anything else they can get into aside from shoes and books and their own toys, which we think they are unlikely to do.  (They only have a few teeth each).

I'm not really sure how to proceed. I want to be a kind dog owner and show them affection and pick them up sometimes.  I don't think they need to be locked up, but I also want to keep them safe.  I don't think they are spoiled, but I've heard it from a few dog breeders and my husband in the past.  Not sure how to course correct myself and the dogs.

- Placed all shoes and slippers where dogs won’t be able to access it.
- We put dextrose powder on their water to make sure they will be hydrated properly.

821,dogs,"Hi all. I need advice concerning taking care of a couple of dogs that were left in my care.

Over Friday and Saturday, I took care of a Dachshund female dog (5 years old) and another male dog (14 years old) that is of a medium size, to which I don't know the breed. I love dogs and taking care of them and know that if they have to go, they will let you know or may end up making a mess, either way, you will know when they urinate, or so I thought.

The little girl had (and this is information from the owner) rolled around in horse poop on Friday night and needed cleaning. I came in on Saturday and watched over them carefully to watch what they may need in terms of food, water, going out.

The dogs slept throughout the day and only bugged me when they were hungry. They rested next to me for the rest of the day. (4am is the start time, 5pm is the end time). I was informed they were walked out before my time started at 4am, so I ended up snoozing the day away as well. The little girl has separation anxiety, so I tried my best to take good care of her.

After my care yesterday, the dogs were quite happy and were walked out and that was that, it was a good time. However, today I'm learning that both dogs ended up with a UTI and now the owner has me to blame. I feel partial to the blame, but now I feel like it might've been that horse poop since a UTI involves bacteria and the dogs slept so soundly with me, not moving to be exposed to anything like that.

My question is, was I completely at fault for not forcing the dogs out or was it that it took time to develop and I wasn't even involved with it? The owner has camera footage of her home, so I'm stating to use that as evidence towards my actions, and care, since I do not want to be blamed for this further.

824,dogs,"Hi,

So I have a Chihuahua that's neutered and crowning and basically his penis sticks out all the time partially due to his foreskin being pulled back and exposing the penis. I don't know if this would be considered paraphimosis because that's usually after a dog is aroused and it sticks out and won't go back in.

I also think part of this is being caused by him being a little bit overweight and pulling on his foreskin which exposes it all the time. But this causes his penis to always be dry and crusty and I do put lubricant on there and clean it on a regular basis but this is kind of very concerning because paraphimosis can be a serious condition which like I said I don't know if this is considered that but it is exposing his penis like paraphimosis. Basically with paraphimosis it could cause blockage where it would make it hard for him to go pee even. Again I don't know if this is the same thing but in the basic sense both of them are having the penis exposed.

My question is is there any procedure the vet can do cuz he already had a procedure but it was with his foreskin and this way is years and years ago. Is there any way and I don't know if you can even do this I'm not a vet or doctor but can they getting preserved for skin from another smaller dog that has the same skin color and surgically attach more foreskin to his penis? 

The only other think I can thi k of again not sure if it's possible as I'm not a vet or Dr but could they cut his penis shorter like the tip so that it doesn't stick out and stays in his foreskin? I mean it's probably about a quarter of an inch sticking out. Also like I said he's neutered so it's not like he needs to really use it to have puppies or anything and just needs to go pee.

Again I don't know if this is even possible and normally I wouldn't even think of something like this it feels kind of mean as far as the second precedure but because of the circumstances I just worry about him and it gets super dried out and crusty and don't want him to get like an infection or anything like that.",t2_i37ff,0,My Chihuahua Penis Is Crowning Possibly Paraphimosis Or Kind Of Similar But What Can Be Done?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zjilsr,True,Deathbyillusion,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zjilsr/my_chihuahua_penis_is_crowning_possibly/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zjilsr/my_chihuahua_penis_is_crowning_possibly/,2470240,1670809593,0,,False,1670809610,1670809610,2022-12-12 01:46:33,,,,,,,

826,dogs,"For anyone interested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zebsx5/my_best_friend_sambuca/) is part 1.  This is a much shorter post than the last but somehow more difficult to put into words.  We have been giving Sambuca his meds as a last ditch effort to slow his decline.  It's only been 4 or 5 days but there has been no improvement.  In fact, his front legs now seem to be getting weak and to make matters worse, he stopped eating yesterday morning.  He will nibble or mouth at some things but never actually eats them.  He is on a strong regime of prednisone and eating food while taking it is very important.  It's also someone dangerous to stop giving prednisone without tapering it off so we are kind of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.  He looks like he has lost a couple pounds as well.  

After a several gut wrenching and tearful conversations with my wife, we went ahead and scheduled an in home euthanasia service for tomorrow afternoon. We have a call scheduled with the neurologist in the morning but we are feeling like there will be no last minute miracle that will cause us to change our minds at this point. In fact, the neurologist would have backed our decision to do this immediately after discovering the lesions on his spine last Tuesday. Also, if it doesn't happen tomorrow it would not be possible to do it again until Thursday as my wife will be on a business trip from Tuesday to Thursday and we both need to be present to say our goodbyes.  Unfortunately her trip cannot be postponed and there is no way we are going to let him continue to wither away for another 4 days.

So in my head, I know this is the right decision.  My heart is another matter. If I am so convinced it is the best thing to do, then why do I feel like such a horrible person? I don't know if this makes sense but Sambuca was not just a dog.  I have owned many dogs in my life (I am 58 years old) and it is sad to lose one always.  This one is killing me.  He is my soul-pup.  

I cannot envision my life without hearing his howl whenever he hears a fire engine or police siren.  I can now envision my entire yard overrun by squirrels once they hear the news that Buca is gone.  He will no longer be at the window whenever he hears me pull into the driveway. I will miss telling him to stop licking and cleaning our other dog as our other dog does not like it.  He will no longer attempt to bully me into giving him his dental bone at 5:00 PM instead of 6:00PM.  There will be no one to open our Amazon packages for us anymore.  He apparently thinks they all contain things for him.

827,dogs,"Hey guys. I have 3 dogs a Shepard ( recently adopted) a husky and my golden retriever. I feel so sad right now. I had to rehome my golden retriever for a few reasons. First off that sweet little baby’s name was Guardian. Had him since he was a baby. He grew up with my husky basically watching over him like a little sibling. Fast forward we move to a new state. New house with lots of space and welcomed a second baby. My golden was for a lack of better words way too hyper. More energetic than my husky which to me was insane. Anyways i tried my best to juggle work ( my wife doesn’t work she takes care of the kids) and giving my fur babies as much exercise  and love as much as possible. But i feel like a failure. I didn’t take the dogs out as much as I would like. This led to them being in the cage more often than they should have. I did let them roam the house as much as possible but the problem is my golden retriever would just trample my two-year-old son, constantly taking his toys and eating his food. the Husky, not so much but guardian was still a sweet boy. My wife didn’t like how he shed so much. I tried to walk him as much as I could but he always found a way to poop or pee in the house, which was very frustrating. It was constant arguing between me and my wife because she never helped me with the dogs because I was always at work but I would forget she’s home taking care of my children this little arguments about keeping guardian or giving him up fast forward to today. I posted him on adoption websites, and some very sweet old lady drove an hour to meet him and told us how she’s had golden retrievers all her life and she just had to bury one this morning after it lived for 12 1/2 years. Moments later, she went on Facebook and saw we were giving away guardian and she said to her if it like a sign because she’s been so lost and depressed ever since her baby died she even said “ his name was guardian like my gaurdian Angel! “ this made me tear up. It was almost like my loss was her biggest blessing. I still feel like shit I feel like I failed guardian. I feel like no matter how much I tried. I couldn’t give him what he wanted, and although he is living somewhere, close by where I can visit him, but he also have lots of land to play around in and someone who’s going to love him very much. I still have my other two dogs but I swore I would never give one of my dogs away. I feel like such a failure.

Honestly i have read that post a 100 times and more and i have tried to forgive myself but i just can't seem to do so or even forget it for a day.

My whole family would cry about our Labrador Nora (my sisters dog that moved in with us after she finished college) died at only 6 years old. They mention her all the time and would say how good she was. I loved that dog, my favourite memories would be when she would come to my bed in the middle of the night and lay on my pillow like a human. I would stay awake for a half an hour straight just listening to her breathing. She had a short but very happy life with the full freedom and love that she deserved. Any time they would mention her i would cry but more about our Poodle Lola (she is the dog that was in ""puppy prison"") 

I would get sad and angry that nobody mentions her... that nobody ever said we feel bad or anything, it would at most be a sigh of regret but nothing more...

For a year i can't fall asleep for hours because i can't stop thinking about her how she watches us eat at the table while she is lonely on her little spot on the balcony. I feel more and more sad every day and i don't know what to do. We have a new dog (first male) that we found on the streets half dead and he has grown to be a very lovable and peaceful dog who you can see really loves life. Daily i spend minimum 5 hours of active time with him (not counting making him to eat or just sleeping with him) and i just can't to forgive myself even tho i'm trying my best to repent. 

Man if a higher power being gave my one wish, anything... i just want to return time and somehow do it the right way. I wish all my dogs from her to the newest pup could play together.

My dog always has some behavior issues so I put it up to being a husky. As she got older I realized she is mixed  half with pit bull. 

I can’t stand the way my dog acts in public. Even a simple walk with no excessive stimulation can be unbearable. If you’ve ever seen an out of control pit bull walk on the lead, pulling and all, that’s very much like what my dog does.

But, through the years I’ve taught my dog so many things. She is clearly very intelligent and has high propensity to learn. She is very kind, she is protective of her family and has also defended other dogs who get bullied at the parks. She’s also actually a rather timid dog once you get to know her

All the doctors and groomers adore her (often tell me “best dog!”). But my life can be very busy at times and I also have a few birth conditions so I have a lot to deal with on my own plate. Admittedly my dog often comes last in the order of things I take care of 

I know she deserves so much more and also someone who can can tend to her with more attention. That’s why I want to give her away.

842,dogs,"I have a 13-year-old chihuahua who has been diagnosed with kidney disease this summer. It first started with her not wanting to eat and from there (with blood and urine tests) she was diagnosed. I switched kibbles which worked for a few weeks, but then that stopped. After we did different wet foods and that worked for a bit and then stopped. Switched over to fresh pet food which worked for a while until 2 weeks ago. Tried Farmer's dog, which worked for a few days. Tried cooking food myself and that worked for one morning. I am so desperate to find food she will eat...but then she is very interested in human food. She loves getting little pieces of food that I'm eating usually but will turn her head and walk away from any food I offer her. I went to the vet with these issues maybe  2 weeks ago (they weren't as bad yet, I could still get enough food in her by hand feeding) and the vet did blood work and urine test again and those results showed she actually had slightly improved and not gotten worse. and even had gained .4 pounds so the vet was just like ""keep trying to get her to eat"" and didn't seem very concerned and told me lets check again in 3 months  (We started her on enalapril about 1 month and a half ago). But the fact that is she not eating anything makes me think something else has to be wrong. I was so desperate I broke down and gave her entyce but that didn't seem to help that much and she only ate a little bit of shredded chicken, rice, and peas and carrots. When I went to offer her more of the chicken she walked away from it.

I guess what I'm asking is...do you think it's her time? She still is her normal cuddly self for the most part and I can't imagine having to put her down just yet... I feel like I need to keep trying and trying just like I did for her brother. I just feel so hopeless and my mental health has taken a major toll with all of this.

It doesn't hurt her when I touch it or mess with it. Whatever it is seems to be localized to the skin, as in I can grab the swollen area and pinch it between my fingers. It's not something laying beneath the skin.

My other dog has fatty lipomas and this is definitely not that.

Thankfully it's mild and if I'm careful I now know how to avoid pain episodes and how to help him if they do happen. Neurologist sent off MRI for final imaging report. This was in October.

3 days ago he called me again. Said that because of where the MRI was focused on, they could see very well into his chest cavity. And he has a very large mass near his heart, as well as an issue with his adrenal glands. This is a dog who is active, happy, and other than the back issue, has been healthy. I'm looking at him and see a dog that looks fine, yet apparently he could have a massive chest tumor. I'm terrified. I know a mass doesn't mean cancer everytime, but that's where my mind goes.

865,dogs,"Growing up I had a black lab, and he never had any dental issues. Now I have a little chihuahua mix (4yo, named Tanner) and pretty much everything says he should have yearly dental cleanings. In the past Tanner has had to be sedated for an X-ray and a trip to the emergency vet and it gave him diarrhea and it took him like a solid 24hrs to get back to normal. He’s so small and the quote already included lines for tooth extractions and pain management and stuff. 

I’m pretty sure that’s like just to show what could possibly be the max price. There’s not indication right now that he has any mouth pain, he likes chewing stuff and crunches his kibble. I brush his teeth (not as often as I probably should), and he gets HealthyMouth in his water. Looking at his teeth the don’t appear to have tartar or anything crazy going on, they’re pretty white.

I just got another dog a few months back and they get along great. My first one is very submissive and my new one is a bit more on the dominant side.

That being said, with her being dominant she does NOT get along well with strange dogs that she doesn’t see on a day to day basis.

868,dogs,"I have been feeling very depressed and guilty lately because the past year I have not been taking care of my dog the way I normally do/should have been. I am someone with debilitating mental health issues, which my dog is actually an ESA/service animal for. 

However this year, my mental (and physical) health have been so bad, and so many horrible things happened to me this year that made feel me far too overwhelmed, but I still feel tremendously guilty towards my poor dog. She has not been getting the love, attention, and exercise she deserves. 

I contemplated giving her away for her sake, even though I love her so much; I thought she would be better off with people who can take care of her better, but at the same time I did not want her to feel abandoned by me and depressed too.

I have been meaning to take her to the vet for like the last month or so as some alarming stuff has come up with her health/physical state. I finally was able to make her an appointment and go (even though it was so shameful for me to explain to them all this). Based on her symptoms (yeast-infected paws which I am currently treating, as well as other factors) the vet believes she may have Cushing’s disease or possibly diabetes.

I had blood work done and I am still waiting for the results; I should get them back the middle of this week. I really hope it will be nothing but the yeasty paws and possibly a UTI, not a serious disease, but the vet really did not know for sure.

I cannot stop feeling stressed or extremely overcome with guilt. I feel like I have been killing my dog, that I failed her, that this is all my fault. The vet assistant said it was not caused by me. I do believe that is true if she has diabetes because she was very overweight for most of her life before I ever got her, in fact I helped her lose all of the access weight and really improved her quality of life. That is why I feel so bad because I was giving her a better life, but have not mentally or physically been able to lately as much as I once did.

I also know the causes of Cushing’s disease is related to tumors and excess production of the cortisol hormone. This has what has been making me feel so bad because I read something that said stressful life events for a dog can increase cortisol levels and contribute to causing it. 

She was a shelter dog, middle-aged, and severely obese when I got her (like her knees would give out on walks from the weight), so I am sure she had already gone through a lot of stress in her life beforehand. However, we also had to move at a couple points, which was hard to adjust to for both of us and with my mental health stuff, I know it affects her and stresses her out when she sees I am feeling unwell. 

I feel like I made my dog too stressed that I caused her disease.

882,dogs,"    **Introduction**
    1)      Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    Yes, this will be my first dog. I have had cats most of my life, and my sister did own a dog for some time in the past, but I consider myself still a first-time dog owner. 
    2)      Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    I have a preference for rescuing dogs over going through a breeder.
    3)      Describe your ideal dog.
    I would like a dog that is medium sized 30-70lbs; highly energetic that I can take for runs or hikes but is also independent. By energetic and independent, I mean a dog where a daily run and maybe some playing would be sufficient for its daily play and energy requirement for the day (another way I am thinking is a cat that I can take out for runs and play with a bit everyday and not worry if I leave it alone for long hours so I can focus on work).
    Because I work remote I would love a dog that would not chew all my cables (I would not mind training). 
    I am okay with some barking but would not like a dog that is very aggressive toward strangers. 
    In terms of shedding I would prefer less shedding and little grooming if possible (but this is my least priority item).
    4)      What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    Currently have no preference for what I would like 
    but if I am going to shelter to adopt a dog, I am assuming many of the rescues will be a mutt / mix of many breeds. Physically I think australian cattle dogs look nice.
    5)      What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    Not sure in this category besides behavior training such as not biting cables and peeing/pooping outside rather inside / letting me know when it needs to use the bathroom.
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    No I am not interested in dog competitions.
    **Care Commitments**
    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    Ideally 1-2 hours a day of play. But would not mind bumping for 3-4 hours if needed.
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    Runs and hikes. Maybe some yard play.
    9)      How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    Ideally I would not mind clipping my dogs nails. But would like to do most of the grooming myself and not hire a professional.
    **Personal Preferences**
    10)     What size dog are you looking for?
    Ideally medium sized 30-70 lb.
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    I would like less shedding. Minimal barking (okay with barking for communication as long as not aggressive).
    Minimal slobber would be best as well. 
    In terms of priority barking &gt; slobber &gt; shedding. 
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    I have no preference here. I would not mind letting my dog be unleashed in my neighborhood as long as it/I trained it to behave well.
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    I am 40 / 60 here. I would like a dog who is 40% snuggly and 60% independent.
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    I am 40 / 60 here. I would want a dog that is 40% more eager to please and 60% to do its own thing.  
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    For both situations, I would like a dog that is not overly aggressive and is more friendly. If I had to choose a spectrum where (0 is very aggressive and will bit) and (10 is overly friendly treats you like another family member). I would want 
    a 7, which is a friendly greeting.
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    I would not mind managing a dog that is aggressive to other dogs.
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    Excessive barking and aggressive behavior. Rough play and breaking everything in the house.
    **Lifestyle**
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    Since I work remote, I will be home majority of the time. So not often will the dog be completely alone.
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    I will be the main care holder
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    Currently no other pets, But I think about introducing a cat as well in the future.
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    No.
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    No; residing at a house.
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    Massachusetts resident here.
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    Summers can hot as upper 90s and Winters can get low as 0F where I live. But on average summers are 80-90s, and winters are 10-30sf.
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Are there any considerations for a first time dog owner should I be aware of. Also for my preferences would it be advisable to go to a dog breeder over adopting.

I’ve just recently adopted a male Bernese (roughly 3 years old) he was in a really sorry state when we first got him, he’s still a nervous boy but he’s coming out of himself a lot which I’m really happy about. 

We already have a female Bernese, nearly 2 years old. She’s naturally a really submissive dog but she can hold her own when she wants to. In the last day or so I’ve noticed Fred will stand over her when she is laying down and will paw at her while doing this. Mabel just lets this happen at the moment and doesn’t retaliate. She’s just very passive about it.

I’m just seeing if this is something natural to happen when two dogs are establishing a bit of a hierarchy? Or is it something else in the works? Is there any other behaviours I should watch out for? I’ve had a look online but some information is quite conflicting.

However, I live with my parents, who have a 2yo Alaskan Malamute named Caleb. Caleb was adopted as a puppy— we already had my cat, when we adopted him, and he has always gotten along very well with him. Caleb is a very sweet boy and has never shown any aggression to the cat and I completely trust the two together. However, he is high energy and he does chase squirrels and groundhogs that get into our yard, and I’m aware of the breed’s reputation.

Surgery is quoted at $7500 CAD ($5500 USD) for both at one time. The two vets we've seen highly recommend the surgery, but say it is not required. One of the main long-term downsides of not getting the surgery is more severe arthritis when she gets older (arthritis is inevitable with/without surgery though). The other downside is that she bunny hops, has stiff back legs and sometimes struggles/hesitates to jump on the couch. 

But again, normally she has no pain or real discomfort and is a happy/curious/medium-energy dog. Mostly stays home (couch potato) with about 30-90 minutes of walk time per day (depending on weather).

She has bowed legs. The surgery will involve three steps:  (1) cutting the bone that the tendon is attached to and attaching it to a better position with screws, (2) deepening the groove that the patella glides on if it’s too shallow and (3) adjusting the tightness of surrounding tissues to hold the patella in place. We were also warned that there is a chance that she may need a touch up on the surgery in a few years. Vet is board certified and specializes in these types of surgeries.

So do you think it is worth it? Both on the side of recovery and success rate, and on the financial side? The surgery would take out a big (majority) chunk out of our savings account, but we also love our dog immensely and want the best for her.

894,dogs,"Hi all! Just after some advice on how to get my dog to stop barking in two different kind of situations. He’s a 4 year old Boston Terrier, he went to basic puppy training classes when he was younger and grew up with three other dogs so is quite a social dog. 

So my dog will bark at house guests when they come in. If they’re family he knows he will do a happy bark and calm down after a while - this is not an issue. But if it is new people or people he doesn’t see often he won’t stop barking for ages and when he finally does, if they do any sudden movements it triggers him to another round of barking. What I have asked guests to do is to come in whilst he is in another room, sit on the sofa and ignore him when I let him in. He will bark for ages, not constantly, but every 20 seconds or so until either he finally settles down ( could be 30 minutes later) or I finally give up and put him in the other room. I know dogs will bark and that isn’t a problem for me! I just don’t want to be scaring off guests or annoying the neighbours as we live in a paper thin walled flat. 

The second situation in which he barks is at strangers when we are out walking. This afternoon I bumped into my new neighbours just as we were heading out for a walk and he would not stop barking. He did not leave a great impression with them and I don’t want to be known as the neighbour with the loud, barky dog. 

Sometimes my dog takes a toy with him when we go for walks and this does stop him barking at people. I try to encourage him to bring a toy as much as possible to stop the barking but he doesn’t always want to. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to stop the barking. Again, I don’t care if he barks a couple of times and then he stops but he just continues to bark until we walk off or he’s in another room. 

Somethings I have tried: 

- On a walk I stand between him and the person so he feels I am protecting him and he doesn’t need to protect me ( read about this one)
- Getting people to ignore him
- Spraying him with a water spray ( I didn’t like doing this, felt it was cruel so stopped after a day)",t2_hziucspx,0,Little dog syndrome (Barking Advice),"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zizrg0,True,Emotional_Ad7602,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zizrg0/little_dog_syndrome_barking_advice/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zizrg0/little_dog_syndrome_barking_advice/,2470069,1670778237,0,,False,1670778249,1670778250,2022-12-11 17:03:57,,,,,,,

The dog is a very picky eater and will rarely touch ration or other dog foods. The most he will eat is bits of food that my grandma cooks for her lunch/dinner.

Apparently, my brother talked to a vet friend of his who said that the dog should only be eating ration and other dog specific food. That vet also asked if the dog is thin and vomits, which he is/does (my grandma says he doesn't really vomit often, though). The vet added that the dog must be thin because he can't digest human food well, which also causes the vomiting, and also said that this diet will slowly destroy the dog's liver.

My brother stormed off angry that my grandma wouldn't listen to him, thinking she's killing the dog. I didn't know what to say because I never heard of any specific breed not being able to eat stuff like grilled or boiled meat, or other vegetables like rice or carrot, as long as there's no condiments or salt in the food. I actually always thought it was healthier for the dog than to eat ultra-processed food.

The dog is indeed somewhat thin. However, I just thought it was simply because he's a very picky eater and doesn't seem to have a big appetite. I don't know the details about his vomiting.

Firstly let me say we plan to go to the emergency vet right away if anything further happens, and are waiting for our normal vet to open to call first thing in the morning.

My parents dog, 1 year old female, about 13 pounds, threw up early this morning foamy liquid and then had bloody diarrhea. Since then she’s been fine, acting normal, playing with my dog, and ate her food (we only have her a very small amount to see what her appetite was.) No further vomiting or diarrhea. She peed normally and has been drinking water. 

Waiting to see what her next poop will be, but what in this situation constitutes an emergency? Obviously we’ll go to the emergency vet if she continues to have bloody diarrhea, but honestly, money is tight for my parents. Is this something we can wait and see if it improves or do we need to rush her in right now?

917,dogs,"My dogs recent rabies vaccines were last year (no specific date, just around 2021). I tried to research the validity of rabies vaccines and i got mixed responses. Some say 1 year, while some say 3 years.

There were instances wherein one of them bites us. I also saw a post saying that a person could die from rabies even after 10 years? Is it true or not? 

For an instance, one of them bit me, but my aunt assured me that it was nothing. That was January 12, 2022, almost a year ago, the dog was then pretty chill, nothing unusual, until now. It's a house dog, does not like to mingle with any animal. I am fine as well, the bite is barely even a bite, it went away after a day. It did not bruise or worsen. I experienced no pain from it. 

Another instance, my sister was recently bit in the hand, it bled but for a second only, our dog that bit her was vaccinated a year ago as well, dog is pretty chill, it's also a house dog that is being well taken care of, has never been in close contact with any dog, rabid or not. My sister got bit because that dog thought that she was going to get his food. After the bite, dog is very chill, nothing unusual happening as well. The bite went away after a day. 

In summary, two dogs who had their recent rabies vaccines last year bit me and my sister. We are advised to not take the anti-rabies vaccine as both bites were small, also might be a waste of money and time as we are fully aware that both dogs are vaccinated, we just are not aware of it's validity.

During my latest trip to Europe, I was mind blown by how well behaved dogs are compared to the dogs in America. I saw several dogs in the city off lead following their owners.  I saw dogs ""tied"" to a post while the owner goes into a store. I saw dogs in restaurants and stores calmly sitting or lying down. In parks (not dog parks), some were off lead running around but not bothering anyone.   

I've done some research and one issue is that in America,  dogs are expected to socialize and say hi to strangers and other dogs. This gives some dogs a lot of anxiety, like my dog, and stunt their training. There is a social pressure that if your dog doesn't want to be pet by strangers, it isn't considered well socialized in America.

In addition,  they only use prize oriented training.  Shock collars and ""alpha"" training are seen as barbaric. I will admit to using a shock collar, and I'm hoping I won't have to use one the next time I train a dog. These are likely not the only differences between how dogs are trained in Europe vs the states, but the ones I could find. 

If you are American,  don't get stuck up if a dog owner doesn't want you to pet their dog.  You are distracting the dog from their training. Just because a dog is fully grown doesn't mean it is not training anymore.  (In case it is not clear, I'm american).

924,dogs,"I do not have a dog and have no experience with training dogs. I have limited experience with family members dogs. I have very little knowledge of crate training other than that when done properly it’s good for everyone involved. The dog will feel comfortable and safe in its crate, and the human can feel good knowing their dog is safe from harm when they leave home. 

My upstairs neighbors have been there for a bit over half a year now. I don’t really know them, they keep to themselves and so do I. I introduced myself when they moved in, said how cute their dog is, and they got weird and backed out of the conversation. Maybe because the listing said no pets, idk. 

They have a fairly small dog. It’s bigger than my cat, but smaller than a Scottie. They crate the dog when no one is home. I know this because the dog spend hours on end digging, crying, and outright howling.

I presume that this is not normal behavior for a properly crate trained dog. Usually this goes on for about 2.5 hours in the middle of weekdays. But a few Saturdays now it’s been all day, all evening, then late into the night. My heart breaks for this poor dog. 

My first question is, are my instincts right? Is this the behavior of a dog that is simply slammed in a crate instead of being crate trained? And my second question if I am right, is what can I say without sounding like a crazy, nosy Karen? It’s a small dog that isn’t particularly loud, it’s not a compliment about noise. It’s about the mistreatment of an animal that deserves better. 

Notes: this is condos, not apartments. I am an owner. They are renting from an individual owner. The HOA docs do not have anything that addresses this.

So I'm having yet another night of insomnia and was randomly scrolling through the internet. Came across what seemed to be an anti-dog community, and then I made the huuuuge mistake of going into a rabbit hole and was just stuck there for a while. 

And I simply have no words for all the hatred I saw. Things like ""dogs should be extinct"" to ""dogs were helpful in the past and now they're outdated and need to go"", which is disturbing enough and shows a lack of basic understanding of how the world works. 

But what really got me was the COUNTLESS posts and comments calling dog owners every name imaginable. And it wasn't about owners behaving poorly, it was an insult to the fact that we dare to like dogs. ""All dog owners are mentally ill, liking dogs should be considered a mental illness"", ""you go out with your dog because you have no personality of your own"", ""dog owners are narcissists"", ""you need a dog because you're an inferior human being"".

And the attacks on mental illnesses and disabilities were just something else. ""You should get therapy instead of a dog"", ""you need an emotional support animal because you're a shitty person"", ""99% of service dogs are fake"", ""service dogs shouldn't exist"", ""blind people who need a guide dog are just mentally ill"", ""if you're mentally disabled you need more therapy and not a dog"", ""if you can't go out without your dog you should just stay home"". 

I swear, I never took anything people say online personally. But this... This made me absolutely sick and still I'm crying. I grew up with dogs. My childhood was a shitshow. I raised a puppy and rescued a stray when I was a teen. I honestly don't think I would have made it if it wasn't for them. Those dogs are pretty much my only positive childhood memories. As an adult I got my own dog at 20. And I can't even describe how many times she saved me. 

I'm fighting an incredibly hard battle with PTSD, and she's training to be my service dog. I do therapy 5x a week, I take a shitload of meds just to be able to get out of bed. And yes, I still need my dog. And I don't know what I would do without her. To read all those incredibly evil things said about people like me just triggered me in a way I can't explain.

931,dogs,"I adopted Piglet spur of the moment almost 7 weeks ago. She was 3 months old, at an overcrowded shelter carrying out euthanizations weekly. Being nervous that it might be a horrible idea, fostering seemed safer. But that process would’ve taken weeks, I was told. So adopted she was and home she came. She quickly took over my life. I’m in between jobs, so we’ve been together constantly. I live in a 1-bedroom apartment with my cat and 11 yr old rescue dog (this January will be 3 years since I got him). Anywho, the shelter was pretty off on their guess of Piglet’s breed and size and she quickly doubled in size. She was crazy hyper, her bark could make your ears bleed, her needle teeth and claws DID make my arms bleed (a LOT), and she was always getting into something or driving the other dog and cat crazy. She single-handedly took down an entire forest with the amount of paper towels I went through to clean up all of the messes. I was stressed and sleep-deprived and pretty quickly realized that it wasn’t feasible for me to keep her. A friend of mine kept pushing me to find her a home but I kept neglecting to search for one. Because along the way… we mastered potty training! We learned tricks and commands, and I became oh so attached, as did she. ❤️She’s an amazing dog and I knew it. Wasn’t hard to find someone interested. A neighbor’s family member asked me to let them know if I decided to give her a new home. Knowing it was likely in both our best interests (for reasons beyond me now), I recently did so. Well they came to get her this evening and I can’t stop crying. I want her back so much. I kept wanting to put it off. And now she’s gone. I feel silly and can’t believe how upset I am! I want to go get her first thing tomorrow! I’m sure I’m not alone in experiencing this… but I guess what I’m looking for is some advice? What should I do?

when i was in a toxic relationship, my ex and i wanted a dog. i tried to show him breeds i felt would fit us but he decided on a siberian husky and didnt budge. he promised me it would be 50/50, because i knew i probably couldnt take care of a husky puppy by myself. she was kept in a cage for the first 8 months of her life by previous owners w no training. when she came to us, she was absolutely insane. jumped on us, tried to rip our hair out, scratched us, wasnt house broken, among a lot. my ex stopped helping me care for her a month in and she was a nightmare for me, but im stubborn and kept trying. my ex was a very unclean person, so she learned to scavenge for his food he would leave everywhere, became food aggressive, resource gaurds, etc. he would basically stick her in a kennel all day until i arrived home after work and she would be a giant burst of energy, and some days i would just break down bc i couldnt deal. she became reactive, she is a nightmare on walks, i cant afford a trainer right now. 

when me and my ex departed things got significantly better and i do love her…but her reactivity keeps me from taking her to work (dog salon), and that was important to me, as it was a great way to fit her into my tiring schedule. i have mental illness, depression, cptsd, etc. (i am seeing a therapist) but most of the time i just wanna lay in bed, its hard for me to get up and go on walks, especially when i know shes going to be a nightmare most of the time, even if i try playing with her before the walk once she becomes fixated on anything i just cant seem to break her focus, and these walks are so stress inducing to me.

i try to keep her energy as low as possible despite this and we cuddle, play and do training exercises but 95% of the time it does feel like a chore. but i really do love her, so thinking about parting with her forever hurts my heart, and i know she loves me. sometimes i just wish that i had a different dog and obviously thats not a good thought to have

My dog didnt poop all day and  6 hours ago my dog got up from a nap and was whining in pain for a bit but then was acting normal. I took him for a stroll and he squatted like he was going to poop but didn't. Then once i took him inside he was panting and pacing.  I gave him two tablespoons of pumpkin puree and he drank more water. 
He kept wanting to go outside and inside so i took him on a second stroll. The second one, he pooped like 2 inches and it was light brown and mushy. 
Now I tried to put him on the couch and give him massages on his stomach, it stopped his panting but now he doesnt want to move and when I try moving him he whines. He was sleeping and i keep hearing loud gurgling sounds coming from his stomach and all of a sudden he woke up, whined and changed positions to his side.

But I’m not sure as to why this happened or what could happen in the future, we got her in March of 2020, she was only with other owners for no more then a month or two, she is nearly 3 now. She was from what we know abused and severely neglected, dumbass omish forced her to eat her poop, and the other owners for a month beat her. We noticed for I believe just the first year, year and a half of having her that sometimes one of her pupils was really big and one was really small, this lasted for 30 second to 5 minutes or so maybe a handful of times. And I read on google that seizures and anisocoria can be caused by several things, one of those being head trauma and being shaken up and or abused. She is a silver lab which are not the most pure breed by any means, so I’m wondering what can we expect, do, and know about this. Is it a neurological disorder or what?

941,dogs,"Heres the filled out questionnaire, any advice would be helpful

**Introduction** 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 
* Yes it will be my first dog, however, I have spent months alone with dogs when watching and sitting them when their parents are out of the country, have helped with leash and obedience training, etc
 2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( &lt;http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html&gt;)?
*  I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder just to make sure I know this dogs history and *some* idea about its temperament, as I have a cat at home already and I want to make sure that the transition for both pets will be as smooth as possible 
 3) Describe your ideal dog. 
* I want a dog that is ideally fine with cats, they don't have to be best buds or anything but a dog thats willing to listen to me and leave her alone would be great. I am a single 29F that's going to be moving into a home soon alone and would like a dog that could be protective of my home towards strangers, but willing to stand down if it's friends or others dogs, (will be socializing this dog every chance I get, and I'm willing to put in all the effort for a well trained pupper). I don't mind a chatty dog so long as they know when its time to be quiet, I work from home, so I have tons of zoom meetings. They should be moderately energetic, but a little independent, play in the yard for some time till I'm able to leave my desk and take them for their walks. I love love love big dogs but I'm fine with a medium to xl sizes, (unless there's a dog out there that's small and can be protective), I'm pretty quiet and my home is not too chaotic, normally I don't leave for long periods of time, unless it's a day in the office which happens about a month or so. Don't mind shedding or grooming, I've already got cat hair on everything I know and love, why not add some doggo hair to the mix
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 
* I like intelligent dogs that you can train well, like German shepherds, poodles, doodles, and retrievers, I like the mix breed dogs that get a mix of traits from both parents, though I have no idea where to find them. 
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? *  basic obedience training, off leash walks eventually, and guard dog training, willing to pay for private instruction if needed 
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
 * No 

Care Commitments 

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
 * I'll be there at home most days, all day, so few hours on, few hours off, lunch break walk, till work is over and then evening walk and training, weekends will be fun day affairs of walking and hiking when the weather isn't too snowy, dog parks, and friends houses for play dates with other dogs
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
* I can give 2 hrs a day for long walks 2 walks 1hr each at minimum. and dog parks for letting off steam and going crazy, as well as fetch in the yard and other things plus those walks at max
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
 * I would be good with weekly baths, don't mind brushing, trims, or ear cleaning at all, hope for 1-3 months for a professional groom, depending on the dog I get of course Personal Preferences
10)	What size dog are you looking for?
 * large breeds 
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? * shedding not a problem, barking okay, would prefer a not so drooly dog 
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 
* I would ideally like to, but if it is not possible that is not a huge deal

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
 * prefers some personal space
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
 * in the middle, trainable but they can be a little spunky
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 
* I would like to be alerted if there is someone entering the yard or knocking, but want the dog to be able to recognize strangers from visitors, or at least understand when I tell them it's fine
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 
* I want a dog that is not aggressive, I have a cat they're little and fast and want them to get along or coexist at least. If the dog is aggressive I am willing to put in the effort for training
17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
 * no 

Lifestyle 

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
 * maybe once a month for an office visit for 8 hrs but other than that I'm home 24/7 and maybe gone for an hour or 2 shopping groceries etc 
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * N/A I live by myself
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 
* I have a cat, a young cat, so can learn to get along with a new pet, she has been around dogs before but generally hides if they chase her 
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
 * nope 
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

943,dogs,"Hi folks,

I (32f) got my dog Bandit almost 8 years ago and he is my first dog. I rescued him from the local pound and he has been the bestest boy. We've been through alot together. He'sabout 9 now and is a Belgian Malinois/Shepard mix.

He has some arthritis and so it has been causing him to poop in the house more (over the past 3 months or so). Then the week before Thanksgiving he had serious diarrhea, vomiting, and lack of appetite. In taking him to the vet, they ran blood tests, x-rays, etc. They confirmed arthritis but in general the diagnosis that he was give was gastro upset and anemia. He's been taking meds for that now.

This last twoish weeks we have been slowly working with him but he does not seem to be improving. He has a really had time getting up and if he does he usually pees in place as soon as we can get him up.  The pee is definitely stinky and he's panting more. He still eats and drinks but he is just very weak and has lost a fair amount of weight. 

I'm planning on taking him back to the vet this week but I fear that he might be reaching his end of life. He has just degenerated so quickly.

Since he is my first dog, I wanted to ask if this may be the end? I mean the vet will run more tests but in my mind something has to be up besides an upset stomach. Like I said he's not super old at 9 but he is technically a senior dog.

945,dogs,"I just need to vent because it really pisses me off that people label my boxer “scary”, “aggressive”, “mean”, and make comments about her! For clarification my dog is well trained, not aggressive, and genuinely the friendliest dog. Does not bark or growl or anything. 
I understand if you have a fear of dogs, it’s very common. But if my dog is nowhere near you, not even paying attention to you, and perfectly well behaved, there is no reason to make comments to me! If you’re scared I’m not going to be mad at you for telling me that, but don’t make it into an insult. 
These are just a few of the interactions I’ve had that really make my blood boil:  

A couple was scared to walk past so being polite I had her sit down and wait so that they could pass me and they turn to me and say “you shouldn’t have a dog that mean out”. Really? Why was that necessary. 

Another experience I had I was walking on a trail and there was a woman up ahead with two small dogs off leash who continuously kept stopping and running around, so naturally we ended up getting closer. So I stopped my dog and had her sit and wait for them to keep going. This happened multiple times in the span of genuinely over 10 minutes, and I at least expected her to acknowledge that we were waiting and maybe let us go by? Or say sorry about that? No. So I then call out and ask if it is okay for us to pass her. She then looks at me and scrambles to pick up her dogs and we start to pass her. She then says “ya go ahead you’re really starting to scare me.” Ma’am if other dogs scare you, don’t you think it would be wise to have your dogs on a leash? 

Another incident happened yesterday where again I was walking on a trail and a woman was coming up behind me with her dog. My dog LOVES other dogs so she decided to stop to see if I’d let her meet this dog. I don’t let her meet other dogs on walks because I don’t know how the other dog reacts to boxer energy and play. My dog lies down, looking at the dog to say hey I’m not a threat to you. The lady says “is she scared?” And I said “no she just really wants to meet your dog, and is in a welcoming position.” She doesn’t say anything and then as she passes us she said “well let’s hope you have that thing under control” as her dog barks and snaps at my dog. 

It genuinely just enraged me that people think that this kind of thing is okay.",t2_94f14zlz,0,The audacity of some people,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Vent]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,vent,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Vent],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,927264a8-7392-11eb-ba74-0e57887e43ad,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#fee686,zigpt1,True,indigobaby-2000,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zigpt1/the_audacity_of_some_people/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zigpt1/the_audacity_of_some_people/,2469900,1670736913,0,,False,1670736927,1670736927,2022-12-11 05:35:13,,,,,,,
946,dogs,"is there any harm or damage if you act immediately on some basic symptoms?

Example; If my dog throws up once or twice but has a completely normal appetite, energy level, and drinking, but I immediately start making boiled chicken and rice and feed that until the dog is either 1) back to normal and doesn’t throw up for at least a day or 2) if the dog keeps throwing up or symptoms worsen take it to the vet immediately 

Or if my dog has diarrhea a couple times, immediately feeding pumpkin and boiled chicken and rice and getting a fecal test and diarrhea panel done ASAP when the vet opens. Despite the dog having a normal appetite / energy/ drinking etc.

I do know vomiting or diarrhea *can* happen for ‘normal reasons’ / reasons that aren’t really serious (such as: change in food or bad treats or eating too fast for vomiting etc) but the fact that it can also be the first signs of *serious problems* is scary to me and I always want to act immediately and observe my dog and do what I can ASAP to alleviate symptoms in order to see if that helped or if it’s something more serious and also see if there’s a change in demeanor at all because if there is something serious wrong, I want as little time to pass as possible before I bring my dog in. 

I don’t want to over react and bring my dog in just because he throws up once or has diarrhea for a day without showing any other signs of symptoms and trying to alleviate at home with a bland diet etc.(?) 

Thoughts? Am I doing the right thing or is me making a bland diet ASAP when my dog has diarrhea or vomiting - too much? Or am I not doing enough?? I don’t know.!?

He’s got crazy separation issues. 
Like I can’t walk to the next room without him following. The bedroom/bathroom door absolutely CANNOT be closed to separate him from me. 

He HATES other dogs. 
At this age, he should be at least a tad bit social— but nope. Fuck other dogs, big or small, male or female.

953,dogs,"I'm wondering if my lifestyle created the perfect dog for me or if this is my once in a lifetime ""soul dog."" I've had my dog since he was 8 weeks, he's now 8 years old. 

I come here and see how many problems people have with their dogs, yet my dog doesn't have a single one. Totally reliable on and off leash, with other dogs, in busy public areas, alone at home, no reactivity or aggression, fine if I'm sick and can't exercise him, and fiercely loyal. If you take his leash he will not happily trot off with you, he'll sit and stare at me until I say it's okay, or if you have a treat and try to distract him from me he will ignore you. 

He also has no interest in toys or chewing/destroying things, he's very dog and people friendly yet has no interest in playing or interacting with them besides a quick sniff or pet. He's the first dog I've had on my own, and besides teaching him like 10 commands when he was a puppy I didn't train him to be this way. (He's now up to about 50, but most aren't commands, most are ""do you want/are you"" hungry, thirsty, sleepy, potty, etc) He's been on airplanes, boats, trains, restaurants, stores, multiple countries, etc and is always an angel. 

My life revolves around this dog, and I know I've been so incredibly spoiled and lucky with his behavior, and an unfortunate side effect of being spoiled by him is I now see dogs in a different view. When we pass by other dogs on walks and they're pulling to meet him and don't give a sh\*t about their owners, I end up thinking, how could I ever put up with a dog like that after him. Or when people post ""funny"" videos of coming home to a destroyed house, or a torn up backyard, the family dinner eaten off the counter, etc. 

I spend at least 21 hours a day with my dog, and since he was a baby I've brought him everywhere with me. I feel like my dog is a person in a dogs' body, definitely understands right from wrong and adheres to that, really doesn't do typical dog things, knows how to behave in public, knows how to communicate with me, and knows what I want/need/expect at all times. Like how a parent would expect their 15 year old to know how to behave in any situation. 

Again, he's been like this since a puppy, I didn't have to train any of these great behaviors and I'm terrified of getting a ""normal"" dog now. My dog recently had a health scare and I truly can't imagine my life without my dog, I'd rather live the rest of my life without a dog than have a mediocre dog that could never compare to him.

958,dogs,"So I’ll start off by saying I’d like some helpful advice, or anyone that can maybe point me in the direction of a resource for information to deal with this problem.

I have an 8 month old baby and a 3 year old dog, my first baby. She is a terrier mix. When I got her, the owners said their children were mean to her, and I’ve noticed she’s not great around toddlers. She gets very nervous around my husbands families children and has shown teeth and growled at them if they get too much in her space, particularly with one of the little girls. She has never attacked or bitten anyone any other dog or animal. She frequently will act the same way with dogs at the dog park when she is feeling threatened or her space is invaded, show teeth and growl. She acted this way long before I got pregnant. 
When I had my baby, she was obsessed with him, in the best way possible. So loving and sweet. Now that he’s a little older and more active, grabbing everything near or around him, she has been getting increasingly defensive. She still shows him affection, gives him kisses and loves on him. There have only been two incidences. The first, he grabbed her belly and she reacted shocked, barking out but not aggressive in any way, I separated them. I have since not let him get near her and only let him pet her gently with me holding his hand doing the petting.
Today he was crawling around and she was laying nearby. He reached out to touch her paw and she barked in his face, very loudly. Again, not aggressive but definitely a warning. This makes me nervous because of how I’ve seen her with toddlers before, I’m scared she will eventually get aggressive and show teeth, or something will happen when my back is turned and she’ll react. Am I being presumptuous? Is she just warning him which is a good thing or can this get worse? If so, how can I prevent and what can I do? I’m scared she might bite him, I want to do everything I can to prevent that. Rehoming her will never be an option, she is my other child.

My question is really in regards to weekend trips. We frequently take trips to my parent’s house where they have four shih tzus.

Is this okay? He does good with the other dogs and is gentle since they are smaller. I don’t leave him with the other dogs alone and they are always separated by a door and a gate if no one is home with them.

969,dogs,"I adopted a dog yesterday and she's the sweetest angel ever. However, she's already about 2 years old and not potty trained, as she used to live on the streets. 

We took her outside 7 times today, yet she still kept peeing inside. We started noticing her going to the front door when she needs to go outside so we always immediately went there if she did it or was about to pee somewhere else. We placed some puppy pee-liners on the floor in every room and she mostly uses them but still had a few incidents on blankets or the floor. I don't get mad with her but i do stop her from peeing and instead take her outside if i notice her needing to do her business.

974,dogs,"My boy is funny. Pit mix. I got him as a rescue almost 5 years ago, when he was 1. He's a big baby, and loves people. I got him early in my relationship with my now wife. He loves her so much, too. It's always funny, because whenever my wife and I try to kiss, hug, cuddle on the couch, doesn't matter he's gotta get in the mix. He HAS to sit between us, or on both of us on the couch. Same when we sleep, he has to squeeze in between us. This morning, I climbed into bed and tried to spoon my wife, and he tried crawling in, until I told him no. So he settled for curling up by her belly, becoming her little spoon. I've often wondered. Is he jealous of me, or her? I always wanted to know what goes on in his head. 

My ""what if"" question is: if something happened to one of us, and the other brought someone new around, I wonder how he would react. Like I said, he LOVES people. Someone comes over, he gets upset if they don't come say hi to him. But he's obviously different with us, like most dogs are with their owners. Mind you, he knows I'm the alpha in the house, but he's also very protective of her. Wife and I were playing once, I smacked her ass, and he didn't like it. I thought he was going to attack me.

976,dogs,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*No, I had small breeds growing up. One was a miniature schnauzer and the other was a mutt (who lived to be 16). 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

*Yes, I would like to be through a breeder. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

*We are an active family but have a small child (3yo) so “active” has become pretty leisurely. As our child grows, I’d like to get back to routine hiking. Right now its mostly walks around the neighborhood and I run when the weather is nice. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
*I had my heart set on a rough collie for many reasons. Turns out my child is allergic to them, which was so sad. Now I’d like to find a dog that is a good mix of collie qualities (smart, trainable, gentle) but hypoallergenic/low allergen. 

I’m under the impression a standard poodle might be a good fit, but they seem difficult to locate in my region from reputable breeders. My area has been hit hard with the doodle phase. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*Nothing extreme, just being a good house pet. I would like to feel confident with the dog off leash during travel (ex. Camping). I anticipate puppy classes. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

*No, I don’t have any specific needs. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

*I work from home so I have quite a bit of flexibility. I think training would pens on the dogs needs, but I anticipate being around it pretty much all hours of the day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

*I would say somewhere between 20-60 minutes. Some days much more (ex.hiking) some days much less (snow storms). I would like the dog to be content indoors when it’s miserable outside but I would anticipate daily walks. We have a large yard for activity. I would rather socialize in more predictable situations like doggy daycares. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

*I don’t mind doing this regularly. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* I think medium? I loved a small “lap” dog but it had limitations. Primarily, always being scared of her size around bigger/aggressive dogs. I would like a dog that could hike and travel easier. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Generally wouldn’t care, but with the minimal allergy requirement I’m assuming “low-shedding?” 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*I would say moderately important. My yard is fenced, but I would hate to worry about the dog bolting if it was in an open area for some reason. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Impartial! Both have their benefits. My old dogs were in the middle. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*Probably eager to please so that it blends in with the family well. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Probably attentive but definitely not aggressive!

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*No. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

*Anything aggressive, or that would make my child or others unsafe. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*Infrequently and maybe a max of 4-5 hours. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Spouse and I will be the main caretakers but I would like the dog to peacefully coexist with our child. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*Nope (fish).

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*Yes, currently 3 years old. I have friends with smaller infants. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*Nope. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*N/A. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Full range of seasons. Summer (~76F, Winter ~30F).",t2_uwcyw7o2,0,Breed for the Family,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Breeds] 📝Recommendation'}]",r/dogs,False,6,breeds,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Breeds] 📝Recommendation,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,3fbe47ba-7395-11eb-9871-0e5318831af9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#d0c69a,zi92qj,True,WhichDogForMe,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zi92qj/breed_for_the_family/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zi92qj/breed_for_the_family/,2469822,1670720045,0,,False,1670720058,1670720058,2022-12-11 00:54:05,,,,,,,

I'm looking for a buddy dog that I can take on walks and be chums with, take around in the car, but will also be loyal and loving with my family, and will protect them. I also have anxiety and OCD so I'm also looking for a dog that can provide some levity and peace in my life.

979,dogs,"We took out dog to the vet yesterday who ran blood work and said he seemed anemic. We took him due to low energy, lethargy, sporadic appetite. We weren't comfortable waiting until Monday for the blood results, so took him to an emergency vet today. At first they said he likely had some internal bleeding from a spleen or liver tumor. They were going to keep him for 2 days for monitoring and possibly do surgery on Monday. However they than called us and said the chest x-ray revealed metastatic tumors, so they sent him home with us and enough Yunnan Baiyao tablets to last 8 days. It's a Chinese herb that is supposed to help stop the bleeding. Since coming home he has eaten two meals and gone for a walk. We aren't expecting any miracles here, but also feel he might have a few weeks to go, possibly a little longer. As compared to the vet who said probably just days based on the x-ray alone.

984,dogs,"To set the scene, my 1 year old whippet has a crate in my bedroom and there’s a dog bed next to it. 

My older dog doesn’t sleep in bed with us and wanders drying the night, so I put a dog bed in the room so she can sleep there at night if she feels like. 

That said, I gave my dog a kong while I took a shower. Whenever I do this, I always put the 1 year old in his crate. 

They’re fine with kongs supervised and respect each others space, but when they’re unsupervised I just prefer to ensure they each get space in case one finishes before the other. 

So with the 1 year old in his crate in my bedroom, I always give my older dog her kong on the couch. 

Usually when I come out of the shower she’s on the couch and he’s in his crate, both happy as can be. 

Today I came out of the shower to find my older dog on the dog bed right next to the crate. 

They do get along and love to play, but they don’t cuddle and prefer to nap in separate places, though usually in the same room.

987,dogs,"I got my dog in February of 2021. I love him more than anything. He is a gorgeous brindle Black Mouth Cur that I would do anything for. I adopted him after dealing with a lot of mental health issues. My therapist realized that I was not as much a $uicid€ risk if something was relying on me everyday. Since then he has been amazing for me. I get out more, I have something waiting for me when I get home, I brag about him constantly. He’s my best friend. My roommate also has a dog. I love this dog dearly. He’s a sweet Rottweiler but honestly my roommate shouldn’t have gotten him. It took 6 months to housebreak him because she just wasn’t consistent. She didn’t socialize him because she wanted him to be protective but also didn’t train him any. The dog is incredibly intelligent and so loving to people he is comfortable with but he’s super reactive. Thankfully him and my dog get along great. Another thing to note is that my roommate is unreliable. We’ve had talks about it before and she’s dropped the ball multiple times but I finally thought we were getting somewhere. We just got our second apartment together and everything was going fine. That was…. Until last night. I went out of town for the first time in months. I had a work party several hours away and they got us hotel rooms. This morning at around 10am I get woken up by a phone call saying we had multiple complaints about the dogs and they needed to go. Apparently my roommate also had a Christmas party, but instead of coming home to let the dogs out in between the party and going out drinking, she disappeared for 12 hours and let the dogs run around on the patio. The dogs have to be locked up. My dog has separation  anxiety and being in my bedroom helps, and her dog is a chewer and has to be put away so he doesn’t destroy anything. They were barking at everything all. night. long. Disrupting the complex and our neighbors sleep. Apparently she let them lose because she felt bad they would be locked up and wanted them to run around some. Now we have a $200 fine and are being told the dogs need to go because they are a restricted breed (mine is not but the color makes him look like it so I know why they think it.) I am devastated. My dog is everything to me. He has helped my mental health, we’ve worked on his, and if I can’t have him I don’t know what I will do. I have diagnosed PTSD and even my psychiatrist supports me having the dog. Her stupidity and immaturity is going to get my dog taken away and I hate her for it. I can’t even trust her for one night so I can relax but I constantly watch her dog so she can do whatever she wants. If my dog gets taken away I will never forgive her.

988,dogs,"Hi all,

I’m staying at my parents this weekend, and they recently adopted a little, 1 year old terrier mix. She’s super sweet, but A LOT and clearly doesn’t know boundaries yet. 

My dog is a little older, about 2, and has some dog reactivity, though he does well with other dogs after a little time. We introduced them today outside on neutral ground, took them on a walk together, and they were doing pretty well! Their dog, Sherlock, was friendly from the get go, but she just doesn’t know when to quit. She just keeps going after my dog, Tucker (playfully) but just doesn’t back off. Tucker has shown no aggression or anything but clearly is uncomfortable, has a tucked tail, and keeps trying to get away from her. He’s shown some interest in play, so I’m hopeful they can get used to each other. 

We’ve been giving them breaks from each other and putting her in a different room when she gets too much. It’s only the first ever day they’ve met so I don’t expect them to be best friends right away, but what are some things I can do to help them both be comfortable? My dog’s comfort obviously is important to me. I get the answer is probably just “time” and to continue to give them breaks, but wanted to see if there was any advice.

She barks aggressively at other dogs 10 times her size at 6 weeks and plays roughly with my girlfriends puppy who is 4 times her size. She often curls her tail up but leaves it down most of the time. She has a white underbelly. Like I said, saying she is very vocal is an understatement. She barks and cry’s very frequently when she doesn’t get what she wants (water/food) or aggressively if she feels like someone is threatening me (wild that she does this at 7 weeks). I’m all ears!

993,dogs,My husband and I just bought a new home and learned the hard way to check for and ask if the sellers left behind or ever used rat poison. We spotted our small dog chomping something neon green and immediately went into panic mode. She had consumed what we think would have been a lethal amount of rat poison left in the garage. My husband used hydrogen peroxide to force her vomit it up within about fifteen minutes - thankfully she had a rawhide chew she was still digesting so the poison didn't make it past her stomach. We are following up with veterinary care but we were VERY lucky to have spotted her eating it. I feel like a terrible pet owner for not thinking to ask. Learn from our mistakes if buying a new home!

994,dogs,"I truly do not understand people who just walk their dogs off-leash. It is not only dangerous for other dogs, who may be reactive, but it is also dangerous for the dog that’s off-leash. What if the dog sees a squirrel or something? Bolts off into the street? It is particularly egregious when someone does it on a very busy street, like this morning when I saw someone doing it on an extremely busy street in LA. 

Like, you literally have a leash in your hand. Is it that much of a burden to just leash your dog? Is the dog really losing out on that much? Sometimes I feel like it’s just people wanting to convey “hey look how well-trained my dog is.” 

It’s obnoxious and I hate it.

995,dogs,"Yesterday when I was driving I accidently stuck a dog. I just took a left turn and the dog chased a cat across the road at the exact same time. I swerved away but still got his front left paw. It was so devastating. Thankfully my boyfriend was put together and able to get out and handle the situation as best as he could. They knew it was a terrible accident. We apologized. I was crying in the car. I thought I killed their pet. They quickly went to the vet and we left and went home terribly shocked and sad. 

Today my boyfriend told me he drove by and saw the dog is up and moving! I'm so so thankful for this outcome. That was seriously one of the saddest things that's happened but to see a positive has been so great.
