1,dogs,"My dog has a limp in her back left hind leg. Shes a 4 year old staffordshire terrier and is a dense little brick. She has good muscle mass in her legs and is very muscular at the same time however.

Sometime a week or two ago she hurt her leg somehow and had a small limp, it didn’t go away so we took her to the vet and they gave her anti inflammatory medication but overall I was upset because I feel like they didn’t get to the root of the problem.

Now i’m fearing this is gonna cause hip dysplasia in my dog because the pills aren’t helping and it seems to be getting worse. 

It’s effecting her motor skills like sometimes when she runs she gallops. When she squats to pee shes slightly floating her left leg above the ground or holding it out to the side out of line from the rest of her body.

When I do the sit command with her she sits on her back right leg and folds her left in.

I’ve been trying to take her on small slow 5-10mins walks on my street because it seems like when she lays for a long time it gets stiff and she needs to loosen it up and i see a little improvement there but it’s definitely not getting better. 

This past year and before she’s been having small issues with limps and she recovers but this time it’s different.

Right now i’m considering physical therapy and heat compression + deep tissue massages? 

My dog is not that old and has a long life ahead of her there are a lot of things I want to do with her and a lot of things as a dog that she needs to experience I can’t let her get hip dysplasia from an injury that could have been taken care of properly.

4,dogs,"My dog is 9 years old, 21 lbs, and looks most similar to a rat terrier. 

To start off, my dog has been going into a bowing position with her butt up in the air and staying like that for a few moments occasionally for around four days. Also, when she lies down I notice she sometimes keeps moving around like she can’t get comfortable. She has not had a very big appetite since this has been going on. I’ve seen if she will turn treats down while she is in the bowing position, and she will. She will, however, accept them when she feels better and will beg me for my food. I’ve turned her over on her back and mashed on her stomach to see if she was experiencing any abdominal pain. She clenched her stomach when I pressed on a certain spot just under her rib cage two times, but then I could press there and she would not react anymore. This morning I woke up to her licking the air like she was producing a lot of saliva and needed to throw up. I let her outside and she immediately ran to some grass and started eating it. Aside from all of this, over the past four days she still runs, jumps, gets excited, and seems happy.  

It’s Saturday, and I took my dog to a different vet because her regular vet is closed (he did throw up in my car on the way to the vet). The vet was an older man-maybe in his late 60’s or early 70’s. I explained everything that I explained in this post to him. 

Before having me put her up on the table, he mentioned maybe she is having spinal pain. I told him that I do not think she is having spinal pain, and that I think that all signs point to it being an abdominal issue. I feel very confident that my dog is not experiencing spinal pain. She has never reacted to me scratching or petting her back, and she runs and jumps like crazy with no signs of any issue. 

When I got her on the table he listened to her heart and took her temperature. Then, he started squeezing down her spine with his fingers. He said then that she seems like her spine is sensitive. However, my dog was simply shaking because she was scared, not reacting to his squeezing. He seemed to mistake her shaking for her having a painful reaction. 

The next thing he does is grabs a needle and starts poking her down her spine. I do not understand how this would tell you if she is experiencing spinal pain. Of course her back muscles are going to twitch and react because you are poking her skin with a sharp needle! At this point I felt like he was trying to trick me into thinking an issue wasn’t really there. Is this a real test that vets do? At most, I feel like the smallest thing he should be poking her spine with is a pencil eraser. He said that he thinks he should give my dog a shot for possible spinal pain. There was zero evidence of spinal pain aside from her back muscles twitching because her skin was being poked with a needle. I know my dog is not having spinal pain. 

I kept having to direct attention back to my dog’s abdomen, and finally he mashed on her stomach briefly. My dog did not react that I know of.

The whole visit seemed very strange. He was not very helpful, and it seemed like he did not want to really even touch her. He did not mention any possible abdominal issues that could be the cause of her symptoms. I thought he might bring up pancreatitis. 

We talked about my options and he said we should do a blood test. It seemed there were about 50 different tests on the panel. I mentioned testing for pancreatitis, and he said it was one of the tests on the panel. He also said they’d also do an X-ray. For both of those tests it was around $400.

I let him know then that I will just pursue the issue and get the tests with my dog’s regular vet instead. He said that he understood. He said he that before I go, he will prescribe my dog some antibiotics and something to calm her stomach. He also said he will give her “a shot.” He didn’t explain what the shot was, but I assume it was the shot he was talking about before for her “spinal pain.”

I told him that I do not want to give her medications she might not need and spend so much money needlessly before even knowing what the true problem is.  

When I got to the checkout, they tried charging me for the office visit and an x-ray that she did not have. 

Am I wrong in thinking that this was a strange experience?

I’m going to watch my dog closely for now, and I’ll take her in to her regular vet on Monday. She is wagging her tail right now. She is swallowing a few times every now and then.

6,dogs,"Back in 2019 my mom adopted a yorkie, all was fine at first because she was still very young but as she's got older she has become very destructive to my stuff, first thing she ever did was chew up my typewriter ribbon (which was an old one i was replacing which is why it was out)  when i asked my mom she was like 'your fault, keep your door closed in future, shes still a puppy' then a few weeks later, same typewriter, i leave it on my bed unattended for like two minutes and came back to find ink everywhere and the ribbon unspooled all over the place, that was fun to clean up.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she starts soiling my expensive rug, No.1 and No.2 everyday, til the point it was wrecked, bought another rug last year, and recently it starts smelling off, no carpet cleaning will save it, she had been secretly doing No. 1 on it every single day, bought a new rug and first day there's mysteriously a No. 2 on it, and again, and again, and today when she went off the deep end via a stomach bug, all over it.

She also once got ahold of one of my 1950s fountain pens and chewed the plastic barrel and even chipped the end off, she has a thing for chewing age brittled plastics.

8,dogs,"My male Yorkie is 1 year old, a bit of a runt, and I'm concerned that I can't see his testicles yet. But there is definitely something going on down there; he is very sexually active (with his favorite stuffed gf) and when his penis is out, it's... disturbing. Unnatural. Smacks of GMO.

It's as big or bigger than what my 90lb lab has. When it's out, he has to arch his back so it doesn't rub the ground, but it still does.

13,dogs,"We have fed our dogs Gentle Giants dogs for most of their lives.

Last year our 7 year old Airedale died of kidney failure. 

Our 3 year Labrador just got diagnosed with prostrate cancer.


Has anyone had any issues or heard of issues with this brand of dog food.  I did a lot of research on this brand but I think the manufacturing moved to China in the past few years. 


I’m trying to narrow down possible causes.

The dog food?
Our water?
The “organic” fertilizer applications on our lawn?

14,dogs,"My parents have two four month old “mastadors” (English lab, English Mastiff). They live in the rural south and have had a lot of rain. They eat EVERYTHING in the yard, and I guess there’s some kind of mushroom that attracts dogs, but is poisonous to them and can cause pancreatitis. My dad didn’t know this and went around stomping on the mushrooms. 

About four hours after, symptoms started appearing. Both puppies were foaming at the mouth, having projectile diarrhea, and one was “shaking violently,” which may have been a seizure (I live out of state). Both dogs got rushed to the vet where they confirmed the pancreatitis via bloodwork. They’re staying at least the weekend with IV fluids, special food, etc. I’m so happy my parents can afford the vet bill, but looking at the cost of that royal cabin food for two dogs who are going to be 100+ pounds….yikes.

16,dogs,"I have a 10 week old pomeranian boy called Teddy who I love very much, he is my first dog (I did grow up with them but obviously never was the one to do the training etc) so I haven't got much experience.

He is a very good boy and is very intelligent for his age, he already has great recall and picks up on his name and is learning sit very very quickly, he is very loving and playful as to be expected. However, I've noticed a few things and there's been 3 occasions where he has fully gone to bite me or someone else when I've asked for help and there's been multiple other occasions he's growled and shown he is upset.

The other day I tried to put his collar on and he went mental, he was crying and yelping and bit me.. I needed to do this so I could start taking him out for a wee to potty train in garden with a leash, I managed to get it on and then whilst it was on I realised it was a bit too big and couldn't get to his neck to take it off or adjust it and then he kept getting his mouth caught on it, when I tried to go close to his neck he would go for me and would growl.. I even tried to use his favourite treats to get him to look away and attempted to calm him down but it wouldn't work, in the end I managed to get it off and gave up as it was clearly too stressful for him and whilst taking it off he was yelping and trying to bite.

Also the other thing is if he ever has something random in his mouth he shouldn't have and is trying to eat and I take it away he will growl at me and attempt to bite if I go near his mouth, I feel like this is partly my fault as when I first had him I stuck my fingers in his mouth and removed something however I had to at the time, and since then he is now getting upset.. instead I'm now giving him a treat to do a trade if he has something bad but I'm not sure if that's what I should be doing? also even when I gave him a treat the other day and he ran off with it, I realised it was too big for him to chew so I wanted to help break it up so he could est it more easily, he then went for me and got upset.. I thought it may be a bit of food aggression so I gave him his food the other day in a bowl and put my hand on his bowl whilst he was eating and he was fine?

Also this happens with other things to, if I try to clean his eyes because of tear stains or mucky eyes he'll start getting upset and will eventually try to bite me if I keep trying, or if I'm doing anything to him he dislikes but is necessary he gets like it even when I tried to clean his ears with solution as he has ear mites.. I'm very concerned and it is making it difficult for me seeing him get so upset and scared when I'm just trying to help him and do things necessary. 

How do I handle this behaviour? How do I successfully get him used to a collar, get him to let me take things away and clean him etc without him getting upset? Right now I can't even put the ear solution in his ear as he'll probably go for me :( and I dont want to keep doing things he dislikes when I dont know how to handle the behaviour when it happens etc, apart from all of the above he's loving in every other way",t2_qicn2se1,0,"10 week old puppy biting when I do something he dislikes, how to fix before this gets worse?","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zi1djf,True,WendyWoox,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zi1djf/10_week_old_puppy_biting_when_i_do_something_he/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zi1djf/10_week_old_puppy_biting_when_i_do_something_he/,2469720,1670701189,0,,False,1670701200,1670701201,2022-12-10 19:39:49,,,,,

23,dogs,"Sorry for the long post…

I want to preface that my dog is amazing. But he has zero clue or awareness about my health, which very rapidly decreased; &amp; it is mega straining our relationship…

I have had a rough few months regarding my physical health. I took a few injuries doing construction during the summer, (fell off a roof, and took a nail puncture to my back), most of which healed fine and were written off. But just as I was about over one ailment, something else would happen. In the last month and a half alone, I had just recovered from COVID and was diagnosed a month later with Pneumonia and Bronchitis. As I’m recovering from those, I get a tick bite and get diagnosed with Lyme disease (am on the meds for that to hopefully hold it off.)

My father decided to come visit me after spending a weekend with my sister and family and got me sick with a sinus infection from the kids. It’s been over a month where I have been nearly unable to do anything other than cook and sleep…

My dog is getting stressed and suddenly disobedient with me because he thinks I am trying to not engage with him like before. (I used to walk/play with him for hours a day; I still get him outside/ out for walks but don’t have the stamina to play.)

I feel like our relationship/communication is deteriorating in a way I have no way to communicate “why” back to him. 

I have nobody else to take him while I recover so I am stuck being sick, exhausted and trying to give every ounce of available energy to keeping him happy. Yet he’s just not seeming to get it. What should I do? I don’t want to shorten his life with stress due to me getting sick.

However he has some serious aggression issues. He was poorly socialised, if at all, previously - so other dogs and small humans are a no no currently. But he has also bitten my husband and I and pretty much everyone else who has visited our home in the 3 months we’ve had him. I can not loose him but my husband is becoming increasing frustrated with him. 
We have had a course of behaviour modification classes with little results. I’ve ordered a muzzle and crate , also ALL the adaptil products I can get my hands on. Has anyone bee. In a similar situ? How did it turn out???

31,dogs,"Hi guys. I have a 2 year old dachshund. I’ve had her since she was a puppy, I’m having a couple issues and I just don’t know what to do. 
We crate trained her from the beginning and she used to be so good in her crate, we let her sleep in our bed occasionally (maybe a 2-3 times a month starting at over 1 year old). And we all sleep better when we are separate (my fiancé and I in our bed and her in her crate). Recently we’ve noticed some redness on her nose and this morning we saw it was definitely from her crate/her probably trying to get out. There was redness/blood all over her bed. I don’t want her in our bed full time but I don’t know where else she should be. I thought about getting a gate instead of the crate but I don’t know if that will solve the issue. 
The other issue we’ve had recently is her throwing up in the mornings if she is not fed fast enough. Most of the time it’s just bile, sometimes (rarely) it will be a small amount of chewed up food. It has happened twice this crate while she is still in her crate, so we let her out and give her bath and wash her bedding then feed her shortly after. 
She usually eats breakfast between 8-9 and and eats dinner around 5:30-6:30. 
I feel like she shouldn’t starving by the time she wakes up. Am I not feeding her enough? Should I feed dinner later? She sits there at stares at me starting at like 4:30 (it starts getting dark then) until I feed her at night. 

More info: She is not the type of dog that will sleep out on the couch or on the floor on her own. I would be fine with that, but she is a Velcro dog. If she has the freedom to, she will sit and scratch at the door all night long. We have also worked from home ever since we’ve had her. She and I go to bed around 10pm almost every night and my fiancé will stay up later and work and come to bed later. We all wake up around 8, but we are usually woken up to her whining in her crate.

Any advice is welcome.

34,dogs,"I'm hoping to get a dog in the next few months &amp; have been looking at different breeds &amp; reputable breeders.

This will be my first dog as an adult, but I had 2 shelter dogs growing up (lab &amp; lab/heelder mix). I'm very drawn to herding breeds because of their intelligence &amp; energy. I also like how glued they are to their owners while hiking, unlike retrievers and other sporting dogs which seem to run into the woods &amp; disturb wildlife while off leash..

I was initially super set on getting an Australian shepherd puppy, &amp; have even contacted reputable breeders &amp; reserved 1 that seems like the most laid-back of his litter. The breeder has done all the genetic testing &amp; seems very good, but they're raised in a farm setting with 2-3 litters at once. My dog will be living in a house with a big yard, 2 adults, &amp; 2 cats, so it's important to get a dog that would be happy in this setting. I anticipate that I'll have 2-2.5 hours a day to devote to exercise, training, &amp; play on weekdays, &amp; more on weekends through hiking once the dog is an adult. I'm not the MOST assertive person &amp; am prone to anxiety, so I'd have to really be diligent about being the leader with this type of dog, but I also know I can learn &amp; train the puppy to become a good companion for me through classes &amp; proper socialization.

The reason my attention has shifted to ES &amp; shelties is for 2 reasons: 1. The ES breeder is much smaller-scale, but very reputable. I feel like they'd do a better job of matching me with the best puppy from their litter, and that in the end the dog could be pretty similar to what I'd get in an Australian shepherd. I understand that they're pretty similar to Aussies, but may be more prone to guarding tendencies &amp; I'd rather NOT have a dog that's hardwired to be excessively protective.. Since this will be my first herding breed, I'm also considering shelties since they're smaller &amp; would be easier to manage and train when dealing with things like reactivity towards dogs &amp; strangers. I also hope to find a dog that won't be super intimidating towards guests, even during the training stages.. I know those behaviors are trainable, but my family would prefer a smaller dog &amp; perhaps smaller would be wise given these preferences? They just seem a bit more timid around strangers than the Aussies I've met &amp; I find their bark more annoying (&amp; I know they bark A LOT). But perhaps they're a smart choice for a first-time herding dog owner, &amp; I can grow to love their barks? I'm also concerned that they won't do as well in a hot climate, but they'd also be more manageable to exercise indoors when its unbearable..

TL;DR : Looking for a first dog, specifically a herding breed. Was set on an Aussie, but am now looking at ES &amp; Shelties for other options.

39,dogs,"Hi guys - really hope people with these breeds or have insight into them can help me know their temperament/personality traits!

Little background: I live in NYC, but it's a big apartment with some outdoor space . I also try to spend most of my weekends upstate for hiking and nature-related activities. I currently have a shiba inu, and during the week his schedule goes: 2 days of advanced obedience training and sometimes 1 day of agility; 2 days of daycare (it's a members-only daycare for the apartment building I live in and all the dogs are temperament tested - he needs to get his socialization somehow b/c I absolutely detest dog parks). He also gets about 1-2 hours of daily walks and I hire a person to hike with him if I cannot take him upstate during the weekend.

So the issue is -- he's 1.5 years old now and turned out to be a really lazy and mellow dog. A lot of people say I struck gold with a shiba like that, but I really want to do a lot more with him! Ironically, I also picked a shiba b/c I heard they're difficult to train and I wanted a challenge. But he turned out to be super chill and not really food-motivated (he's also not toy-motivated lol).  I've done the most I could with him and he's a very well-behaved dog that knows a lot of tricks, but doesn't seem excited or motivated to do more advanced training with me (except maybe agility but if you've seen Lobo the husky, he's like that haha). Most days, he's more content lounging in his dog bed and just chilling. I honestly feel kinda bad dragging him to all these training classes and he checks out pretty fast during sessions.

I've began looking into different dog breeds and hope to bring home a bigger dog in the future that's highly motivated, trainable, and biddable (planning for 3 years in advance). I know reputable breeders have a long waitlist so I'm planning far ahead. I've owned golden retrievers and labs in the past, and am not opposed to having them again, but I also want to hear about GSDs, Dobermans, and Malinois.

I also got tickets to attend the AKC Meet the Breeds event in January and hopefully I can have in-person experience with these breeds but want to hear from actual owners as well! My absolute dream is to own a Malinois or Doberman and do advanced obedience + schutzhund work (I'm already in contact with an ex-k9 handler trainer for this), but I worry about the weekday schedule -- would that be enough exercise for them? 

tldr; please help me decide between these breeds if I want to do advanced training with them!

I was prescribed trazodone and gabapentin (along with carprovet) because I told the vet trazodone doesn’t really work on her—I’ve had to use it once and it did nothing. She said the gabapentin/trazodone combo should be more effective. 

It’s not working. She thrashes in her crate and has extreme pent up energy. We called yesterday and increased her gabapentin to be taken three times a day (and to try mental stimulation toys like snuffle mats and lick mats) and that hasn’t worked. I’ve now been told as a last ditch effort to increase her trazodone to three times as well.

46,dogs,"Hi! Sorry for the long post, I really need help with choosing a course of action. I apologize if in any way I come across as ignorant on the matter or wrongly informed, I am doing my best.
I have a 9 year old female pomeranian and would love to try again at having a second dog. First round didn't go great, we had another younger pom (female as well, none of them spayed) and the dogs absolutely hated each other. Became terribly territorial, tried to constantly kill each other and the like. My parents didn't want them to be spayed still.
We tried everything except that. Constant behavioral training with different types of trainers for years and even meds for our current pom (the ""instigator"") but nothing worked. Our second, younger pom passed away from a surgery accident two years ago.
Our current pom is a really sweet dog with people, but has always had the behavioral issue of not really loving other dogs. I can manage it outside on our walks by redirecting and refocusing her, I praise when she does even just a smidge of good relations with any dog and when she looks at me instead of craning her neck trying to find a dog to fight with I treat it like she just cured cancer. It works with me (she doesn't instigate when I'm the one walking her) but with my parents she becomes an absolute fear driven devil. All the trainers we've worked with told us that she's probably not been socialized well (at the time she was my parents' dog) and is now unable to grasp that not all dogs are terrible scary creatures, and that it's probably a deeply ingrained fear response.
That being said, our second dog that passed was an unspayed female and i suspect that had something to do with the total hatred they felt for each other. I have been wondering if getting a male dog could be a good idea... I think maybe she's just really female reactive and tries to attack every dog fearing it's a female. She never gets close enough to discern, I think. The new puppy would be neutered obviously, heavily socialized and trained to be an agility or otherwise sporting dog because that's the type of companion i want. He would have to be a breed that is not dog reactive or heavily territorial, and I'm willing to train consistently and constantly to ensure the socialization is optimal and he doesn't have any fear regarding dogs. Of course I don't care if he's a bit inherently aloof with strangers or other dogs, I mostly care about my current girl and her issue.
Do you think trying with a boy could change her view?
We would try to foster the puppy for a brief period before adopting to see her reaction, and if it's a no-go that's okay.
Is there a breed that would be a fit for our situation and wishes? Or does she absolutely have to live alone?
I think with old age approaching, a companion that understands and respects her might help her calm down and not be driven by fear. What do you think?

Today at our morning walk my baby had an epileptic seizure. It felt like it last forever. It was horrible. She couldn't stand or walk. Her eyes went almost completely inside her head. And all I could do was waiting. Waiting till it was over. Waiting that she would stop to seize. When she eventually stopped I drove her immediately to the ER. At that time she was completely fine, just a little tired.
They did bloodwork and gave me emergency meds.
Now I have to wait. For another seizure. I love my baby to death and would do everything for her. But I am scared and shocked and don't know where to go with my emotions.

51,dogs,"hi! some background info first: i'm training my dog to be a service dog to mitigate my disabilities. my state allows handlers of service dogs in training the same rights as those with fully trained dogs. i'm doing this on my own and have been as i can't afford a trainer at the moment but hopefully once i get on disability i can do that. my dog has had practice with down stays in non pet-friendly spaces at restaurants and in my lecture hall class last semester. however i realized she needed more work on her down stays where there's little external stimulus around for her (i don't need my dog to watch me; it actually helps she is observant of our environment). she's been good for about a half hour to an hour in restaurants but in my longer lecture hall class, she'd cry. she's a cry baby and does it to express how she's feeling. considering the circumstances i think it was boredom. her exercise prior to these outings were about a ten minute walk and at least her quick initial go busy (GB). i'm also trying to see how much exercise she needs to suceed at this and use her Fi tracker/timer (i need to get better about timing her exercise) to help.

52,dogs,"It was an early Wednesday morning, and I brought my dog to the vet to check his tail. I noticed the night before that his tail was no longer standing up and was hanging low between his legs which was not normal (he's a beagle). I also noticed that he was in a bit of pain as he would suddenly clench his body and release the tension after a few seconds. So I took him to the vet and got the doctor to run a few tests on him to find out what was wrong.

Now, this veterinary clinic only allows one client at a time at their reception area. The client they are currently servicing should be the only person in their reception area since it's a small clinic. The rest of the clients are directed to the waiting area, where they are told to queue to avoid any problems. As I said, it was still early, and my dog and I were the first to arrive, so we were directed immediately to the reception area so they could service my dog. My dog was obviously under a lot of stress and pain that day, so he was a bit agitated and kept clinging to me. Nevertheless, the doctor was able to run tests on him, and my dog and I were sitting in the reception area waiting for the results and the possible medication that would be prescribed to him, along with the bill. A few minutes later, an old woman and her dog suddenly enter the reception area. She then sat directly in front of me and waited for the staff to notice her. By this time, my dog was still in pain and stressed out, and the woman was currently on a phone call talking loudly in front of us, which did not help the situation. 

A few minutes later, my dog started barking at the lady as he grew even more stressed by her loud conversation on the phone. The staff tried to walk my dog around the clinic, but it did not help as he was still trying to cling to me for comfort, so I carried him and hugged him to calm him down. A few minutes passed, and the old woman ended her call and started to accuse my dog of being rabid and said she did not feel safe around my dog. The staff tried to tell her that my dog was probably scared and stressed since he was in pain due to his tail. They also added that they know my dog and have *never* seen him act rabid or aggressive toward them. Still, Karen was now shouting and pointing at my dog, saying that he would bite the staff and that they should not have allowed my dog to enter the clinic. 

With her shouting, my dog started barking again, and by this time, the doctor came out holding the results and prescription for my dog and asked what was happening. After the staff told the doctor of the situation, the doctor immediately told Karen that she knew my dog and that he was obviously scared of Karen. She continued to accuse my dog of nasty things, which were so ridiculous that I found myself unable to argue due to her ridiculousness and merely laughed at her. The staff and the doctor were already speaking up for me, so I tried my best to calm down and help calm my dog. Eventually, the staff told Karen that she was not even supposed to be at the reception area because she was not currently being serviced and that only my dog and I should be there. Hence, they led her to the waiting area outside. My dog immediately calmed down as soon as she walked out of the room. 

The doctor and the staff apologized to me for what happened. But I told them they did not do anything wrong and that I was glad they had helped me with the situation.

54,dogs,"So, I'm recently after acquiring my older sister's dog. She is a 6 year old Lakeland Terrier who is, for the most part, lovely. She has some issues with food aggression but I'm working on that. However I am a complete newbie to dog training, I've never owned a dog before, I just want to help this one.

The main issue is socialisation. She wasn't properly socialised as a puppy (as far as I know, she wasn't at all) apart from one incident where her first ever time meeting another dog led to it snapping at her and biting her face. 

Safe to say, she's not too keen on other dogs now. I really want to socialise her so she can come with me when I go on walks with my friends and their dogs, without her trying to attack them, or so I can bring her to the beach one of these days, or even just bring her on walks and not have to worry about muzzling her. 

On our walks, she's met a few dogs, the resounding reaction being the other dog gets excited and she freaks out and starts growling and lunging. I always bring her muzzle on walks just in case though so no dog has been harmed. 

She has reacted this way to every dog she's ever met apart from one. His name is Toby, a old golden retriever who is the most docile dog in the world. She was okay (ish) with him, a bit apprehensive, but as soon as I went to pet him, she snapped at him and I had to pull her away and tell Toby to go back inside. She definitely gets jealous.

The obvious idea is just to take her to places with dogs, muzzled, and let her get used to them from a distance, but I live in very rural Ireland and I don't have a car as I'm 16. There's no towns within walking distance, and dog parks aren't really a thing over here.
I've been trying to convince my mother to let me take her places, and she is slowly giving in, so I kinda need to know how to go about this when she does let me.

The other issue is grooming. She, according to the groomer, is an absolute angel for her sessions, but whenever I try to bathe, brush, or do anything to her, she growls and I am forced to back off so she doesn't bite me.

I could just muzzle her and do it anyway, but I fear that would make whatever aversion to me grooming her she has, worse. I don't want to have to go to the groomers whenever she rolls in shit, which being rural Ireland is basically every other day.

59,dogs,"Safe to say I've had a bad stroke of luck for me. My first dog got to the age of about 14 and started bleeding for no reason. We got it checked and she was treated for hemmoroids. This went on for months, and they insisted it was hemmoroids. One day, she just stopped being herself. She stopped moving around like she used to, we knew that her time was up. We took her to the vets again, the vet which diagnosed her the first time wasn't in that day so we were seen by another. They concluded it wasn't hemmoroids, but in fact cancer. By that point it was already too late, she had to get put down minutes later. That was the end of ours and her suffering of years of worry and pain.

A few years later we have another dog, an English Bull Terrier. At first I thought these dogs were vicious due to how they looked and what their history was. 

Boy was I wrong. 

I've never seen a more gentle giant in my life, wouldn't hurt a fly. Never nipped, or bit anyone ever.

Gets to about 10 years old and he starts to lose weight at an abnormal rate. We get it checked, they say its 'X Y and Z', and gave us medication. 

He continued to lose weight, before you know it we take him back - he has cancer, and again was already too late.

63,dogs,"So I have two doggos, one is a smaller pittie lab mix, he has the physique of more pitty, my other dog is a pittie, lab, and Shepard mix. She’s way bigger than him, I’ll put a comment of a picture of both of them. I was feeding Leo (boy dog) about 3 cups a day, and feeding gilly (girl dog) about 3.5-3.75 eyeballing. I did this for a long time and i noticed they are not gaining weight. I’ve had Leo for ALOT longer and he’s almost always looked like that. I have no idea why he is so small and won’t gain weight. But I’ve now started feeding Leo 4 cups a day, and gilly 4.75-5 cups a day. Because they need to gain weight. Or at least I think so. I’m reading nothing that says this is too much and people say you should feed less but I’ve been feeding less and they don’t gain weight. We’re not a very active family, we work 10 hours overnight and we take them out to play with eachother when we can, they get taken out twice-3 times everyday. With usually a mild walk to at least get SOME movement in. Is this too much food? Am I doing something wrong???? I would buy protein tablets or something but I just can’t afford that so I’m doing what I can

76,dogs,"Hi all!

I wanted to preface this post by saying that I know the risks of bringing home two puppies. It was ultimately not my decision. Please do not comment about how much of an idiot I am, I already know, and I still would like some advice from those of you who have successfully kept littermates in the past.

I recently adopted a lovely 5 month-old doberman mix puppy from a local shelter. I went with my mom, who had no intention of adopting a dog for herself, but went with me for support/to meet the new member of our family. We went into the room full of sweet puppies, and my mom fell in love with one of the littermates. So, we ended up taking both home. The shelter gave us the whole ""scare"" about littermate syndrome, saying that they never do this but our circumstances were unique so they decided to ultimately let us take them home. The ""unique circumstance"" being that I plan on moving out within the next year or so to attend grad school (and we are not first-time dog owners, just first-time littermate owners).

Here is our plan (and I would love for more additions if possible):

1. I bring my dog to work with me at least while he is potty training. I work in a vet clinic and there is a boarding facility in the back, away from other animals. I can bring him out for socialization and play time during break/slow periods of the day.
2. Separate sleeping areas. Kennels will be in different areas of the house, my dog is the only one allowed in my room. 
3. Separate training and feeding schedules/locations. I am solely responsible for my dogs training and my parents are responsible for their dogs training.
4. Separate toys, my dog will keep his in my room.
5. Playtime will be supervised and limited to a few hours a day.

Here are my main concerns/questions:

1. How often/long should I allow for interactions between littermates to occur?
2. What early signs should I look for?
3. Do I need to always be concerned over littermate syndrome, or will the likelihood of them developing this issue decrease as they mature? 
4. What else can/should I do to ensure that both dogs are given enriching lives, without fear of developing this issue?",t2_75jc4rhp,0,Advice on Avoiding Littermate Syndrome,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zhmtg2,True,aestheticwithapen,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zhmtg2/advice_on_avoiding_littermate_syndrome/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zhmtg2/advice_on_avoiding_littermate_syndrome/,2469501,1670660109,0,,False,1670660126,1670660126,2022-12-10 08:15:09,,,,,

I do what I can, but he’s a bossy boy so he does get a few more treats than maybe he should. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when we found a lump on his side. Scary, but also very common in labs.  Long story short, just fatty lumps and a solid diet will help him. 

Decided to stick to his diet, (NO TREATS!! ) and he has a fancy diet food with fish skins on the side (dried skins are from my parents, from the east coast).

I don’t want to jinx things, but since his store bought dog bone style treat lifestyle has ended cold Turkey… my labs personality has changed significantly.  

…He’s calmer and allllllmost less demanding. 

Example: I took him to a store… yes he was focused on the counter dude for a treat, but he didn’t bark or pull.  Doesn’t bark at magpies as much and he doesn’t fuss in an attention seeking way anymore (like whining while looking at me).

106,dogs,"Hey everyone,

So this started about a month or so ago. She started peeing in the house and it was small concentrated spots so I figured she had a uti and took her to the vet. They confirmed their was some blood in her urine and a uti was likely. I gave her the medication for two weeks and after the first few days she stopped. Everything was good for a couple more weeks but she has started back at it. Sometimes it’s really large clear puddles and sometimes is smaller concentrated spots. I’m not exactly 100% if the large spots are from my other dog though because I never catch them in the act. I am certain the smaller spots are her though because they happen when only she has access to our living room. 

So I called the vet again asking to bring a urine sample in to see if it’s something more serious but they want to do another round of medicine. Which to me seems kind of pointless and like it could be prolonging something that could be more serious. But they said that the first round might not have been enough to cure the uti. I’m going in the morning to pick up the next round but I was thinking about calling another vet.

I hate my dog and I feel horrible about it

I am aware it’s my fault and that there is nobody to blame but myself, I feel ridiculous even typing this out, but I just need to vent. 

My husband and I have wanted a dog for years, but patiently waited until we were financially stable enough and had our own place. Both of our families are very dog-oriented and experienced pet owners.   We have both have spent the majority of our childhood around dogs. We also frequently “dog sat” for several days to weeks at a time while family was out of town. I was sure we could handle it. 

 I am probably just a horrible person but I felt a tinge of regret in the first week and it has not gone away. I am finding it extremely overwhelming. Our dog is not even a puppy, she is two and we rescued her in September. I am so fucking sick of not being able to do anything or go anywhere without worrying about what she is getting into. she cannot even be trusted to be alone for 2 minutes. We have done plenty of research and tried so many things to keep her enriched and we walk her multiple times a day. if I even shut the door for half a second, she will already be getting into the trash. Not to mention she has single-handedly destroyed our apartment in less than 3 months, shredded our door frame, ripped up the carpet, gone through 5+ beds and it also takes her less than a day to ruin the toys we buy her, no matter their durability level.  And yes, we do crate her when we leave, but she broke out of her crate more times than I can count. Zip tying it didn’t work, so we literally had to buy 6 padlocks to prevent her from getting out. 

She does not ever leave us alone. I can’t take a nap without her whining. I can’t sleep more than 6 hours without worrying about a shit or piss time bomb. She is extremely inconsistent about indicating when she needs to go outside. Sometimes she will let us know, other times she just shits out of nowhere with no indication whatsoever. On the one day I had leeway to sleep in, I woke up to the smell of poop in my room, went to open the door and of course it was right next to the frame so the door mashed it into the carpet and spread it everywhere, so I spent my morning cleaning that up before work. 

My house used to be so clean and perfect all the time and Yes I realize I am an ass for thinking I should get a dog and expect to maintain that. I just want my fucking life back and I am so sick of revolving it around this animal that consistently ruins everything we give her.

My vet put my puppy on a prescription diet which did not help his issue at all. I then decided I would try eliminating things - starting with chicken. That can't be the culprit as it has persisted.

My work has suffered. My life has suffered. And I know the time will come where I have to decide that it's his time to cross the rainbow bridge. The worst part is that despite the swollen lymphnodes, he's still the energetic loving doggo I rescued almost 6 years ago. 


Neck filled with fluid, only 1 nostril functional, he will still run around and play as if nothing is wrong. But I can see that he's not functioning at his normal capacity. It's not fair to him. Let me suffer, but let him continue to spread the love and joy he brings with everyone he meets.

119,dogs,"I have some advice for all of those struggling pet parents, that might be loosing their minds when it comes to crate and separation training. 

I am not one to gatekeep &amp; this method literally saved me from ripping my own hair out &amp; having daily breakdowns. 

If you have a puppy who is struggling with crate training, separation anxiety etc, this is for you. 

And no. I am not about to suggest that you let them ""cry it out"" I'm sure you've tried that, because that's what everyone says. It doesn't work for everyone. 

I've had a lot of ups and downs with my puppy and his crate training, so I've picked up a few tools and tricks along the way. 

Pet Remedy calming spray (Adaptil and other similar brands never worked for him, but this is an absolute godsend) really soothes and relaxes our boy, we asked his daycare to use it when he goes down for a nap in a crate &amp; they actually realized it calmed all of the puppies down, not just him. 

A lot of the issues stem from the fact that after a while, your puppy has associated the crate with being left alone, and no puppy particularly enjoys that. You need to work on separation training outside of the crate first. 

I found myself going around in circles because we got our lab to love his crate through lots and lots of positive associations, then when he was left alone, he started crying, whinning to get out etc. Next time I tried to put him in the crate, he was very reluctant. I focused on crate training again &amp; it went well, only to be completely undone when I left him again. It drove me insane. 

You need to do separation training &amp; crate training separately. It's the only thing that worked for me. 

You need to identify what clues you give your dog that you're about to leave, do they hear your keys jingle? Do you put on your shoes &amp; jacket? These things quickly become pre-departure queues and make your dog panic. 

Put on your shoes and grab your keys randomly, and then just go back to doing stuff in the house. 

Do this a LOT, desensitize your puppy to these cues that so far have meant you are leaving them. 

For separation training, if your pup is anything like my velcro dog, they might follow you around the house as you go about your daily stuff. 

You need to bore your dog into not doing that. 

Sit on the couch next to your dog when they're calm and do an exercise that's referred to as ""door is a bore"" stand up, take a step towards the door &amp; immediately sit back down. Do this consistently until the dog loses interest because you're not doing anything fun. 

Slowly increase this depending on your dogs tolerance. Take each step as something to build up to. Walk closer to the door come back and sit down. Put your hand on the handle, come back and sit down. Open the door and immediately close it, come back and sit down. 

Once the puppy is completely uninterested with what you're doing, and completely calm while you do it, move onto the next step. 

Once you're able to open the door, walk out and close it, spend a second or two outside, come back in and sit down. 

Increase the time spent outside slowly, once you're working on increasing the time spent out of the house, use a dog camera to watch your pup. Watch their body language and always try to walk back in BEFORE the whining and barking starts. 

SO many people will tell you to just let your puppy cry it out. And this does work for some. 

Others will tell you to leave you puppy with frozen Kong etc. By doing this, you are simply distracting them, not teaching them to be happy alone. The food eventually runs out, and they panic again. Eventually they may not even want the food because they're already scared &amp; distressed. 


For others it's just reinforcing the idea that the crate, or being alone is bad, because they feel a negative emotion, they feel panic or stress etc. Every time you allow it to get to that stage, the response of barking and crying gets reinforced more and more. 

Focus on preventing your dog from whining. If you see they're about to start barking or panicking, get them out of the crate, or come back inside. 

Obviously we all have busy lives, if you need to leave the house while working on this, you just have to leave. In that scenario you need to focus their attention on food, a toy, a really long lasting chew they love etc. Be careful not to use the same toy or treat every time as this can also become a pre-departure cue. And do your best to limit these outings as much as possible during this training. 

This method takes time &amp; it takes patience. 

But the result is a puppy who is completely calm and content for hours at a time. It's truly worth it, and in my experience it's the only thing that works in the long term.

120,dogs,"my boyfriend and i adopted a little chihuahua (?) mix about 2 months ago who we named phoebe! she was a stray before they found her, so they have no history on where she came from, how long she was a stray, etc. the pound aged her at 5, our vet aged her under 3. we’ve been successful with desensitizing her to walks and potty training, she is a lot less fearful now and has generally been adjusting to her new life really well! we are going to visit my parents for christmas which is an 8 hour drive away. we live in an apartment so it wouldn’t be realistic to ask a friend/family member to come and take her outside to potty every 4 hours or so, and she is still fearful of people. so because of this, we think it would be better to take her with us. she was quite stressed in her car ride home from the pound. weve been trying to desensitize her, i started with just sitting in the car with her while treating and praising. i did this several times and lengthened the time spent in the car each time. then we took a short drive around the apartment complex, then a drive to a different place in the apartment complex and a walk around that area (she was most nervous about this one). she is doing better and better in the car, but i’m afraid she won’t be ready for an 8 hour drive in a few weeks. not only the drive, but then staying in a hotel in a new place, and seeing my family and their dogs. my mom says she will just eventually calm down on the drive but i’m just worried it will be pushing it too much and i would hate to stress her out too much. i know her progress is dependent on a lot of things, but does a few weeks seem like a reasonable amount of time to prepare her for a road trip? she seems to pick up things very quickly and easily, so i’m hoping for the best, but if not we can definitely consider other options like one of us staying home. she was on anxiety medication for the few days she was at the pound, so we were also thinking about getting some from the vet for this trip if that may help. please help! :)",t2_9hl9ie4l,0,is my car anxious dog ready for a roadtrip?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zhdoo8,True,Factor-Mental,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zhdoo8/is_my_car_anxious_dog_ready_for_a_roadtrip/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zhdoo8/is_my_car_anxious_dog_ready_for_a_roadtrip/,2469340,1670631867,0,,False,1670631885,1670631886,2022-12-10 00:24:27,,,,,

123,dogs,"11 years ago, I was in a bad way. addicted to the opioid medication my doctor over prescribed me for my back. I was a shell of myself; at rock bottom &amp; fallen from grace. I was walking through a nearby park one cold December Day and came upon a shaking cardboard box 📦 and 2 adult dogs tied to a tree whining. I opened the box to find 8 beautiful puppies: 4 all white, 3 all fawn &amp; a runt that happened to be white with fawn patches. 

Despite my poor health, as a dog lover, I began calling my then girlfriend, friends, family, about them. It was not long before I had put together a small audience for these playful pups and even had 4 spoken for! Always a fan of the underdog, I couldn’t help but watch Kona sit staring at me while being pushed to the back. It was fate. She was the outcast. I , at that time, I felt like an outcast. And after getting 5/8 adopted, the mom, dad and 3 others into a foster home, I took Kona home with me. 

I can’t honestly say today if I would be alive or not if it were not for this girl. She loved me unconditionally when my girlfriend left me, my parents nearly disowned me and all my friends disappeared. But she gave me purpose. No matter how bad things were, she was always my priority. She ate before I ate. One night I passed out with a pizza in the oven and she woke me up on the ground in a smokey townhome as the pizza caught a flame.

And my love for her made me decide to get clean after I took her with me on a 115 degree summer day in my truck to meet a dealer who was running 1 hour late and I was in a high crime area. Kona, despite my A/C on Blast, was panting so hard pushing her nose to the A/C vent (actually took a photo of her doing that as a reminder of how i hurt others which is included from that day in this post) and she was tired from sitting up right in my truck…. It was then I decided enough is enough. I drove to the nearest circle K used my pill money for a gallon of water and her favorite- dentastix. then to the pet market to buy her the highest grade food she ever had and bones. even cooked her a steak that night. 

The next day I asked my parents to watch Kona for 4 nights, checked myself into rapid detox at the hospital and have been clean ever since. 

I have reclaimed my life, my friends, I have an amazing girlfriend, own my home, car and am a business owner. I have everything I need in life because I met this dog on one fateful day in December. 🙏🏼🐾🐶❤️In she’s still going strong!",t2_9kzd241g,0,To: The Dog that saved my life on her 11th Birthday!

127,dogs,"Sorry guys this is a bit long winded but I wanted to give you all the details.

So to start off Toby is a 2 year old rescue greyhound and we've had him for 6 months. We're in the UK and as many know, it's difficult to heat houses at the minute so we have a blanket for Toby when he goes to bed as well as PJs.

I came down late last night for a drink and decided to check his blanket was still on him like I usually do. I did my usual pre-blanket stuff to make sure he's not going to be startled (switch the light on, talk to him and interact for a bit) but last night he wasn't as awake as I thought and he bit me. Told him firmly ""No"" and walked away. Came back after half an hour to see if it was just greyhound startle or if it's an issue and he bit me again so I told him off again and left him alone. Talked it through with my parents, we put it down to greyhound startle since he was back to letting me do whatever I want with his bed and had no problems with anyone else touching his blanket. Just made the rule ""don't touch Toby when he's sleeping"" which is very fair.

Cut to this afternoon, I've finished playing with him and cuddling him so he's definitely awake. I go to move the blanket off the floor so I can hoover in a few minutes and he bites me again. Told him off and didn't pay him attention for a little bit. Told dad what happened and he thinks that because Toby has got no issues with anyone else in the house he must view me as lesser to him compared to my parents and brother. Dad's solution was I need to take control of his dinners more often (I share the responsibility with mum) and pay him less attention. He also wants me to start training him more to establish more dominance and show myself as someone to be respected.

I want to believe dad because he's the one who grew up with dog trainers for parents but I'm just not 100% convinced. Nothing has changed with how me and Toby interact with eachother, I do just as much for him as my parents do  (walking, feeding, washing etc). Just today he's decided ""I have a problem with you and nobody else in the house."" He's absolutely fine with me until I touch his blanket. If he's on the bed at the time he bites, if he's stood up at the time you can see he's on edge. I'm just not sure what's going on and I'm worried because I have a 2 year old niece that has a weekly visit to the house and I don't want to put her at risk if Toby is biting.

Note: When I say biting he's not using much force, I'm not marked or bleeding. He barks while in bite motion, clamps down a little bit and then immediately let's go, curls up and starts growling. There's no whale eyeing or anything like that its just all one sudden motion.",t2_8qdj2onp,0,"My dog bites me and nobody else in the house, I'm not 100% sure why?","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zhcsji,True,Compostgoblin,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zhcsji/my_dog_bites_me_and_nobody_else_in_the_house_im/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zhcsji/my_dog_bites_me_and_nobody_else_in_the_house_im/,2469322,1670629614,0,,False,1670629628,1670629629,2022-12-09 23:46:54,,,,,

129,dogs,My dog is 5 years old and in the emergency vet. After surgery at a regular vet for fear of obstruction they found no obstruction but a mass but everything in his body looked fine. He came back to from the anesthesia but really unstable. Had to take him to the er. They stabilized him and was getting better and better. But all of a sudden in one night his eyes started swelling up. And first they thought it was a tumor behind his eyes because of the mass they found inside him and theres a chance there are more tumors but ruled that out with a MRI. And said that the salivary glands and some other glands in his eyes were really swollen and that's why his eyes are getting swollen and everyone was happy that it wasn't a tumor or cancer. They said they will put him on drugs and steroids to get of the swollen glands. But instead of getting better it just got worse and one of his eyes is wayyyyy swollen that if he puts his head on the wall his eye can touch the wall.and they said he might lose that eye. The other eye got better but this morning started getting swollen again. Around his eyes and his neck is all swollen. They have no idea what it might be that's causing the glands to swell up and they don't think the tumor has anything to do with what's going on in his face. They checked everything blood work and everything that they can do and everything turned out fine. They also checked if the glands had cancerous cells and they doesn't. All the doctors and specialists say they have never seen a case like this. And i cant even find anything or anyone that had went through this online either. They said that he might have a chance of getting rid of the tumor with surgery if not chemo but we can't do any of that until he gets better with his eyes. They said if he doesn't get better the only option would be to remove his eyes. They still have him on drugs and steriods at this point and just waiting to see what happens.They say other than the swollen glands he's completely fine and would have been home yesterday eating and everything and have us going over what we can do with the tumor.he's fighting really hard and wants to go home everytime we see him but they can't figure out what he has since Tuesday night and already Friday night.

141,dogs,"I adopted a neutered male lab mix, 2 years old, from a rescue about 6 months ago. He seemed like the perfect fit. He was potty trained and loved me, my husband and our kids. He was happy all the time, tail constantly wagging. He had a good appetite.

Inexplicably, a few months ago, he had a major personality change. I say inexplicably because *we have been to many different vets to rule out all health issues* and he got a clean bill of health and nothing in our home or our routine has changed at all. 

He started not eating, not playing, and peeing all over the house. I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on different foods, cleaning products, training, etc. Nothing is working. He just seems miserable. I have an arm injury that makes it difficult for me to wash him and his things several times per day. He will pee on himself and lay down in his pee, requiring me to bathe him multiple times a day. The water bill is getting ridiculously expensive and it is to the point where we are lucky to be able to have any hot water left to shower ourselves. Our drain gets severely clogged with his hair a few times a week. Maintenance is getting annoyed, as is our landlord. We don’t have the ability to have a hose outside where we live. We rent. 

The worst part is that the smell of his pee is getting on all my work clothes no matter what I do and I cannot work at my job reeking like dog urine. I’m also having asthma attacks from the constant urine fumes. I’m also getting styes in my eyes and hives on my skin since he started peeing all over. I’ve been tested for dog allergies and I’m not allergic to dogs. It’s just his urine. 

We try to lavish him with attention and he gets walks and goes running with me every day. He just has zero interest in us anymore, or life really in general. I’m not sure what changed but I am going to have the rescue take him back in a few days and I’m already feeling so horribly guilty. I know I’ve done literally everything I can for him, at expense to my family. 

This is not something I am doing lightly. I just want to hear from others who have been through this and find some support. I hate knowing that soon he won’t be in my life anymore. I have fond memories of him before he basically became a dog we don’t even know.

149,dogs,"This is a vent. Ugh. 

I just got back from a trip to one of my favorite local pet stores with my somewhat stranger-shy dog and while we were waiting to be rung up, a customer approached him with a big smile and outstretched hands. As he did, my boy backed up and sat directly beside me and I told the man that my boy is shy and that he’d rather not say hello. The man smiled MORE and stepped even closer while he said to me, “I can see that!”, and then said to my boy, “hi Buddy! I’m gonna be your best friend!” 

Dude. WTF. 😡

I said in a much more stern tone, “Sir, please step back from my dog. He does not want to meet you.”

The guy ignored me AGAIN, laughed, and made silly playful gestures towards my boy, who was actively looking for a way out at this point (the register is in a corner so the guy basically had us penned in), by anxiously craning his neck to peer around the guy towards the door. I was about to escalate to full pissed defense-mode, but luckily another clerk came over and swiftly took the man away. 

Usually, my boy loves this store and the people in it, but he wouldn’t take treats from them or even from me. He just wanted to leave. The clerk handling my transaction apologized and gave me a handful of them for him, but only once we were safely outside the store did my boy start to relax and enjoy them. 

I was sooo angry! No, my dog doesn’t necessarily bark or growl at strangers, but between his very obvious body language and my direct words, the guy should’ve had the decency to respect his space and back the heck up. It’s encounters like these that could increase my dog’s stranger-danger to a more serious level, so I advocate for him every time. People really can be stupid, selfish, or both!

150,dogs,"I've been using a chuckit pro launcher and it works ok (my dog is super drooly, and also more willing to let me pick up the ball with the launcher), but it's a bit iffy in my small-ish backyard because they seem to really be designed for distance throwing (my yard is maybe 80 feet long). I've tried a few different balls with it and find the air balls work best, but once he's played with them a while they seem to get a little misshapen and then will sometimes get stuck in the launcher and almost impossible to throw. The ultra balls fit quite tight as well and it's hard to put enough force in to dislodge them while not throwing it a long distance.

157,dogs,"We adopted a pit/mastiff last may and she's been a wonderful dog, she's currently around 9 months old, and weighs about 62lbs. I've had her insured since late June, with her policy being effective as of July.   


In the last couple of weeks we've noticed a pretty stark change in her behavior - she's begun to sleep a lot more, and seems more lethargic then usual. I've noticed her ""pulling herself"" up onto our bed, and she seems a bit wobbly/slow to start in the mornings when we let her out of her crate or gets up from a nap. It's almost like she flares her front shoulders out when she starts walking. She's had a ""sloppy"" sit since we got her, which was a bit concerning but she's never had any issues walking/running/jumping until now. She still gets excited for walks, her ball, trips to the park etc..., and is still eating and drinking. At first we thought it might've been seasonal depression or something of the sort, as we live in the PNW and the change of seasons can be fairly dramatic in terms of the weather and daylight.   


The obvious thing to do would be to take her into the vet, but due to our insurer's policy of a 1-year waiting period for any diagnosis or treatment of hip dysplasia, I'm worried that once it's documented we'll effectively be out of luck insurance wise. This would make her eligible for treatment/surgery in July, which is also a ways out if she's truly suffering from HD. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a caveat, quite literally the night we got her from the shelter she came down with severe pneumonia and was hospitalized for 6 days. We paid almost $6k out of pocket for this in the first month of having her, and would gladly pay for any HD treatment/surgery if required. We just need more time financially, and of course the insurance would help us greatly down the line if she needs or would benefit from a surgical procedure.

164,dogs,"I have changed vets too frequently because something *just doesn't sit right*. I don't know if it's me and my standards are way too high or it really is just what I think it is. 

**Vet 1:** went to get core shots, kept upselling a bunch of other shots. Had to keep going back and getting charged recheck fees on top of the shot fees to find out that they weren't shots necessary for me dog's lifestyle. Then was also going back for Giardia, and it turned out that it wasn't even diagnosed and was prescribed out of ""possibility"" for one dog, and ""to be safe"" prescribed it for my other dog without even testing her for it. I was going to this vet twice a month for 2 healthy dogs for rechecks and medicine they didn't need...

**Vet 2:** heard that I wanted to get my dog spayed and didn't care for anything else. She even said that my dog had slightly enlarged lymph nodes, but didn't do any testing on it. Just told me its not big and could be naturally a little big. scheduled spay. 

**Vet 3:** This vet was in the same clinic as vet 2. I only switched to vet 3 because vet 2 didn't honor the scheduling and it may be possible my dog was going to go into heat again if the surgery wasn't done on time. She was getting spayed because her cycles seemed like they were very hard on her. (later on it would turn out it was because Vet 2 ignored the Lymph nodes and it was cancer, making her heat cycles hard on her) 

This vet also gave her a bacterial infection during the surgery. plus poor stitching. And prescribed two antibiotics that didn't work. I understand 1, but if 1 didn't work, maybe do a scrape and test what antibiotic would be effective?? which is what I requested she do before prescribing antibiotic 3. Her guessing game was pissing me off a my girl was suffering from her incompetence. 

I told the clinic she wasn't feeling well after the surgery - and they said wait it out. When I went in to get her stitches out, I told them to check her over again, and test her lymph nodes. yes it turned out to be cancer, and the bacterial infection they gave made it worse. 

**Special Vet 1:** oncologist, recommend by Vet 2. Had a piss poor attitude and told me that he does cancer treatments all the time, in a way that made me feel like treating my dog was ""whatever"" He asked ME what the prelim exams said - so he didn't even bother to look at her intake files?? And was doing a quick diagnosis at the moment? And top of it, he knew about her situation and still said it was fine to wait 2 weeks for our first appointment. Lymphoma can kill in just weeks and Hera was already suffering after the surgery and infection. I had to call Vet 2 to get her to consult and prescribe something for my dog that seemed like she was dying. 

**\*Special Vet 2:** This oncologist I found myself after all the BS. This guy was great. Empathic and listened, looked at all her information. His protocol was no nonsense. Everything was fine with this one until Hera was out of remission and starting her 2nd protocol. When she passed away, he got her name wrong in the email. Normally not a big deal, I was devastated at the time and it hurt that it seemed he was careless. I don't hold it against him and if I needed an oncologist I would still go back to him. Overall, great vet. 

**Vet 4:** The emergency vet that saw Hera in her last days. Cold af. Thought she was saying sorry to her when I was crying that my dog was dying and was saying sorry to my babygirl that this was happening to her... that she was having trouble breathing. This vet wanted me to do overnight stay and whatnot, but I could tell my dog was not having it, she wanted to be home, safe, comfortable and with me. 

When she did pass away a few days later I had to bring her back tot his vet bc I couldn't think straight and this was an emergency vet. This vet came in to verify death and kind of had a ""yep knew this was going to happen attitude"" tone underneath her flimsy condolences. 

This is the same vet that wanted to charge a no show deposit for my other dog after this clinic made us wait almost 2 hours to see someone. Essentially charging me for them not showing up to see my dog. I gave up waiting because Otis seemed to be fine/ calmed down as we waited so long. 

**Special Vet 3:** Otis needs a dentist. I can see that his chipped tooth has a pulp showing. he's going to need work. They wouldn't let me set an appointment bc it's a referral specialty clinic. That's absolutely fine. My problem was the girl on the phone was giving me attitude because I asked them why a referral if it's obvious he needs work, what would the primary vet do? I'd like to get him treated as soon as possible and be able to afford to do it instead of spending on money for an unnecessary primary visit. She tells me it's like the same for people, with a holier-than-thou attitude. ... No. If I have chipped tooth and pains, I go to a dentist. I understand if oncology, cardiologist, etc needs a referral. But the attitude just grated me. 

This dentist has all the credentials and I want the best for my dog, but the way intake was handled puts me off. And Special vet 1 supposedly was one of the best too. So maybe accolades aren't everything. And now I'm on the search for another primary vet I guess to go through all the channels to get my Otis to a dentist, but I'm irritated at my last vet 4 for a no show deposit and yeah I'm feeling a little petty to not do the deposit even though I know I won't lose it bc I keep all my appointments. I also don't like the way they handled Hera when I bought her in DOA. It took over 30 minutes for the vet to come in and take a quick look at her and get down a time. If she came in with something that needed CPR or something... it would have been so late. 

TLDR; Maybe my standards are too high but every vet that I've been to makes me uncomfortable that they don't give two sh\*ts about my dogs. **If anyone knows of any good vets on Long Island, NY please let me know.** I'm sorry for this long post, but I'm getting so frustrated and I feel like I'm going insane just trying to get decent care for my dogs.",t2_bxk9x964,0,How do you know a bad vet from a good one?

She has eaten poop in the past, but never to this extent. Pretty much, any time that she is hungry and is let out in the yard to go to the bathroom, she’ll eat poop. This can be once a day, or multiple. Considering that Daisy is already on the chunky side on top of having damage to both of her ALCs, my boyfriend is concerned about increasing her portion sizes of food since he doesn’t want her putting on extra weight to strain her ALCs.

166,dogs,"Hey reddit,

So Milly is a wholesome, playful, and curious puppy. Trainings going ok but I'm having some issues. Mostly her biting everything, hands, feet, slippers, doors, snow, and anything made from wood. 


Another problem we've been dealing with is her fighting herself in the mirror. In our front foyer we have a floor to ceiling mirror on the cost closet. She will sit in front of it and bark at herself for hours. Sometimes she gets pretty worked up and shakes, other times it's more playful. I'm not sure what to do.


And Finally, crate training.she seems to be terrified of her crate. When she's fallen asleep we put her in there and she'll chill for like 30 mins but em comes out again. She won't stay inside it after she wakes up. I want to promote it as a safe space for her so I've been gentle with putting her in there. Can someone let me know if I'm doing things right? Or does anyone have any helpful tips?

168,dogs,"So as the title says, I just started working at a local daycare that’s been in business for a couple years. I’ve only been here a week and I’m appalled at what I’ve seen so far. Sorry if this is long, I have a lot to cover.

The facility is kept very clean. They don’t believe in cages so each dog has its own room. They’re fed and watered consistently, they get baths and their rooms are cleaned twice a day so I have no complaints about the way they board them. But that’s the extent of the good things that I have to say.

The daycare is an absolute nightmare. Not just for me, but for most of the dogs as well. There’s 2 different enclosures for big dogs and small dogs with a large room that leads out into a yard, so they can run back and forth. But for some reason they decided it would be a great idea to throw every single dog they can into the daycare. Since I’ve been there, there’s been 50-70 dogs in the small daycare and 60-90 in the big daycare. The ones that are just there for daycare come in around 7-9am and can get picked up anytime. Most of them get picked up around 4-5. The ones that are boarding go in at 7 and are out around 2-3. So the majority of them are in there for 7-8 hours. They aren't able to leave or take breaks from the other dogs, they must stay in there the entire time.

The numbers are already a red flag, but they also don't separate them for any other reason other than size. I would say a third of the dogs have at least one of these traits: starting fights by either barking at, biting, chasing or jumping on other dogs, humping, not responding to their name, playing too rough, targeting the same dog, or just being aggressive to other dogs in general. The ones that are especially aggressive to either dogs or humans aren't allowed in the daycare and get their own personal playtime, but honestly I think a good bit of the ones that are in daycare shouldn't be and should be getting personal playtime as well. 

There's 1-4 of us MAX watching them at any given time. This makes discipline extremely difficult, especially when the ones that cause fights don't respond to their names. They've been teaching me to smack them and yell at them, which I think is horribly wrong and I hate doing. But it gets to the point where that's the only way they listen because there's TOO MANY in there. They don't give us any tools to break up fights, other than a spray that does absolutely nothing. We are told to mostly use our hands which I think is incredibly dangerous for everyone involved. We wouldn't have to break up fights if you didn't throw a shit ton of problem dogs in a room together. 

My coworkers also RARELY take out the problem dogs, and when I've tried, they told me not to. You're yelling at the same dogs all day when you could, you know, just take them out. They take out the ones that hump and annoy other dogs before they take out the ones that are actually being aggressive. Makes no sense.

When there's that many strong personalities in the daycare, it's gonna cause the other dogs to become fearful and defensive. And that's exactly what happens. In both rooms, there's about 15-20 dogs that sit against the wall the ENTIRE time they're in there, tail between their legs, shaking, crying, the whole bit. It breaks my fucking heart. If another dog comes up to them, they either run away in fear or snap at it, which happens way more often and usually leads to a fight. Some will go up to the door and jump and scratch, and when people go in and out, they'll escape just to be tossed back in. Why would you force a dog that's clearly terrified and unhappy to be somewhere where they clearly don't wanna be?? It infuriates me how no one sees any of these things as problems. And 90% of the time when you're bringing these dogs to the daycare area, they'll pull against the leash and you have to either shove them in or pick them up and put them in because they refuse to walk in themselves. 

There's one super tiny, super old blind dog that they put in the daycare for some fucking reason who just stares at the wall the whole time and shakes every time a dog gets near her. Literally bawled my eyes out earlier thinking about how tragic that is. Is it so hard to provide personal playtime for these dogs that clearly need it? It makes no sense why they would just provide it for super aggressive dogs when the super scared dogs need it just as bad. They obviously aren't playing with the other dogs and everyone is so busy making sure there's no fights to pay any attention to the scared dogs.

Yesterday, they put me in a daycare of 50 dogs by myself and I was so stressed that I started crying. It absolutely bewilders me that the people that work here think any of this is normal. I'm so disappointed this was my first experience working with animals, which is something I've wanted to do my whole life. I love the line of work but I absolutely hate the way these people run their company. If anyone could give me advice for green flags to look out for in future daycares, like the right way to go about making sure every different personality of dog gets their playtime, etc. please let me know.

I'm sure if the dog owners knew what was happening, NONE of them would be going here.

I’m also looking for cheap gifts ideas. I was thinking of maybe some wood circles and dog safe paint so that each owner could get a print of their dog’s paw? Or a little treat bag?

I guess I don't know what to do. He is 7 years old and he is the best dog I could have ever asked for. Part of me wants to do chemo because he is relatively young but part of me doesn't want to drag this out if he is going to suffer. It is funny because he is acting like his normal self. Eats fine and we still go on long walks where he runs around in circles. You would never know that he has maybe months left. If I could just get at least a year more out of him with the chemo than I think it is worth it. Please someone share your thoughts and experiences.

177,dogs,"I’ve had my dog three years. And what drew me to him was he was a small sweet looking hound. Nervous sure but he looked good. No medical issues they told me about.

He’s my first dog. And I wanted a few things when I went to adopt. I wanted a dog who would play fetch with me. A dog who I could snuggle in bed with. And a dog who liked going on walks. A dog I could take to fancy dog bakeries and make treats for.

Instead I got my dog. He though initially didn’t show any medical problems has the most allergies his dermatologist has ever seen. This dog is allergic to everything from his own skin yeast bacteria, to dust mites, to almost every food. To the point he is on $80/month prescription food. It’s been three years of dermatologists, meds, vet bills.

He doesn’t like walks. At all. I’ve never met a dog who didn’t like walks. He just lays down if I dare make him go. 

Fetch? Nope. I throw toys and he looks at me offended. Like “are you going to go get that”. He won’t play with toys or chew on bones. 

He also has sleep startle so no snuggling for us. Unless I want to get snapped at or nipped.

My dad and I were walking our dogs in the neighborhood, as usual.  As we were passing someone's house,  their dog escaped the storm door and charged.  I was more worried about my dogs reaction then the other dog because she barks at other dogs.  However the dog straight up bite my dog on the face.  My dad was able to get it off, and the owner pulled the dog away.  It was perfectly calm after.  Luckily,  my dog doesn't have any serious injuries and didn't seem too fazed during the rest of her walk,  though I'm sure that didn't help with her anxiety. 

What do you think triggered the dog? The owner said maybe it was protecting their new puppy or something. Honestly,  this is something that I'm worried my dog would do because she will charge at people but only bark.  After this though I don't think she even knows her mouth is dangerous.

190,dogs,"My dog Goldie (F/coonhound mix/7/spayed) developed a lump under her skin near her shoulder about once inch long about a year ago. The vet said to watch it as it was movable and soft. A few weeks ago I squeezed it pretty hard to check on it prior to a vet visit and a day later it swelled up like crazy. A few days after that, it turned pink on the outside and sort of came to a head. When I squeezed it slightly, it popped like a pimple and poured out some light red blood which I guess had pus in it. Once this happened the vet took us in and did a FNA. Unfortunately she came back in the room and told us that she can't tell what it is. She did see white blood cells but it didn't sound like that means anything. She said it likely isn't anything to worry about since it's movable but I'm still freaked out.

191,dogs,"5yo mixed breed, his name is Hank.  

I spend a lot of time creating parodies of popular songs with custom lyrics about Hank. For example, ""Sweet Hank of Mine"" (Sweet Child O' Mine), and ""Tiny Hankers"" (Tiny Dancer). To name a few. 

Unfortunately, he does not respond (or pretends not to care) about these songs. I thought it was a familiarity issue at first, so I played the originals for him in the car just so he would get to know him. Then I followed him around the house singing them. He only looked at me with his head turned to the side. He did not look happy or appreciative at all. In fact, when I hit the high notes on the chorus of Tiny Hankers, he actually left the room.  

It is extremely frustrating, I spend a lot of time thinking about these songs and he doesn't even care. I even got out my piano the other day to play him a new one (""Purple Hank"") and he yawned and then fell asleep.

It first started probably 3 months ago, I brought him to the vet and they couldn't notice anything and gave me pain killers, it went away then and came back probably mid October for a day or two, but then went away again. 


So that was 6 or so weeks ago and he's been fine and showed 0 problems when out running and playing, then out of nowhere the other day it's back again, but worse than before and has lasted a few days now, I've brought him to the vet and again they can't notice anything, when you move his injured paw/leg he shows 0 signs of pain or reaction to it, he just can't bare weight on it. 

I assumed it happened from him jumping up and down from the bed etc as he's so heavy and his joints wouldn't be fully developed, but idk now.

197,dogs,"Hi all. We recently adopted a 3.5 y/o BC. Prior to her adoption she was bred in Washington state and had two litters. We have a cat and frequently have very young grand children visit, so we asked many times if the dog was good/safe around those potential triggers. The breeder swore up and down that she was totally fine with cats and kids. 

We also learned that the dog had only been vaccinated at 3 months for Rabies and was due by law to get her now overdue shots. So, we got it, as we have done with all our pets over the years. 

The dog relentlessly chases our cat and even escaped to chase a cat she saw outside. And when she’s gotten swatted, instead of backing off, her aggression increases and she begins snarling. We have to keep the cats  separate from the dog for their safety. 

Additionally, my sister’s kids came over and the dog chased, growled, and nipped at them. 

Our vet and trainer think that it’s likely we’ll never be able to trust the dog around cats and kids. We’ve been training her to focus on us when she sees a trigger - for example bikes going by etc. she also is exhibiting fear aggression around strangers . We think out environment might be unhappy for her at best and unsafe for her and us at worst. Sometimes it’s just not a good match. 

We told the breeder about these behaviors and she insists that we are describing a different dog. She truly thinks the rabies vaccine is to blame. And while I am in no way an anti vaxxer, I can’t help but go down the rabbit hole and see that some people think that the rabies vaccine can lead to permanent changed in a dog’s behavior. 

Am I being gas lit or did I mess up this animal’s personality by getting her required vaccines ? 

And before the BC Police come for me- we have experience with the breed (2 prior family dogs) and are aware of things like their need for a job, enrichment, exercise and about their herding instincts.

200,dogs,"I have been at a loss with my 4 y/o shepherd/retriever mix (rescued in November 2020) since I first adopted her and things seem to only be getting worse. She is such a sweet girl but has numerous problems like severe separation anxiety (can’t be left alone for 2 minute or she will bark and tear up the house). I have tried everything from medication, seeing a behaviorist, and all types of training but nothing has worked.

My family has been stepping in and helping a lot with her to the point where she is pretty much their dog, especially my grandma. Unfortunately I had to move away for work and we felt that it would be better for the dog to stay with my grandma, aunt, and uncle where they have a big house and backyard as opposed trying to move an anxious dog to a big crowded city. She would also make my life very complicated if I took her with me since I’d have to spend thousands on a dog sitter for every occasion, from going to work or going out for a drink with friends. 

Lately my family has been complaining that the dog has been aggressive and barking a lot at everyone, including at my uncle in his own house. There is another dog who lives there, a feisty dachshund who barks and has always been aggressive to strangers. We think that my dog’s new behaviors could have been learned from the other dog and a combination of her genetics. My grandmother is my dog’s primary caretaker since everyone else works and is busy. However, she has no training capability and spoils the shit out of the dog. I think she wants her to be aggressive so she can be protective and scare off people. My dog never behaved aggressively under my care and I know it’s a lack of training that’s causing this. But how do you explain training to someone who doesn’t think it’s necessary and doesn’t know how to do it? My grandmother is extremely stubborn but she is the only one who can take care of the dog since she is home all day.

Today my grandmother said she came across a mentally ill person on a walk and the dog kept barking at him. Apparently the guy said he would shoot the dog next time that happened. My dog has never bit anyone but I’m scared that someday she may go too far and someone may try to sue us or have her euthanized because of her aggressive behavior.

These attacks happen generally when food is around or when she gets jealous that I or my fiancé are giving the other dog some attention. They occur about once every three weeks.

I reached out to an animal behaviorist who charges a hefty fee. I am willing to do this if this behavior continues, but since the cost is so steep I would like to explore other resources in the meantime.

241,dogs,"As a pet brand born out of love, SpunkyJunky has collaborated with a group of fantastic bloggers and influencers on our social media. They come from different countries and have varied backgrounds. They do, however, share a common sensibility in that they consider their pets their closest friends and give them unconditional love.

Today, we'd like to introduce you to Samanta, a technician girl from Germany, and her two adorable fur friends--Buddy and Ace, two white Swiss Shepherd.

**SpunkyJunky: Sam, how did your story with Buddy and Ace began?**

**Samanta:** It began with Buddy, a little bit more than 3 years ago. My family always had dogs and other animals so it was clear that I’ll have dogs too someday. 3 years ago my sister asked if my boyfriend and I would like to live in their village because they need a new renter. We said yes because it was much cheaper and we were allowed to have pets - it’s very very hard to find a village in Germany where you’re allowed to! And then I asked my boyfriend about a dog. He said if we get a dog, then only a Swiss shepherd!“. One day(!) after I showed him a breeder and we visited him… and got Buddy with us.

Ace came into our life 6 months ago. I wanted a partner for Buddy. I wanted a third partner for me. I’m not a fan of holding a dog without another dog. They’re packed animals.😁

I know that it will be hard because buddy HATES other male dogs. But from the first minute in he loved Ace.

**SpunkyJunky: So what Buddy and Ace mean to you and your families?**

**Samanta:** Everything! For me they’re not just dogs, they’re my kids and my best friends in one. My family loves them too. Every time they come around they have something for buddy and Ace - something to play or eat like for a grandchild.

**SpunkyJunky: What inspired you to create a IG account? Any hard part/difficulty in content creating?**

**Samanta:** I just wanted a diary for remembering my time with the dogs but it got so much more. I met many great people and got friends that I never wanna miss again. It’s hard sometimes because where’s love there’s always hate and envy but it’s not that much that I’ll say I don’t want to be here anymore. I love creating the content, it makes fun. Just the algorithm sucks soooo much but that’s not in our hands.

**SpunkyJunky: Do you have any tips on eating healthy for doggy?**

**Samanta:** For ME the only way to feed your dog like he/she deserves is the raw feeding. But it’s not as easy as giving your dog some meat and that’s it. You have to think about so much and have to calculate! If you don’t have the time and space for raw feeding wet food is a good alternative. I really don’t like dry food and it’s not healthy too.

**SpunkyJunky: Do you have a preferred local pet brand? What makes you a fan of them?**

**Samanta:** Hm, no! I am a really big fan of small brands. I find them on Instagram. I don’t like the mass processing when it goes to stuff that my dogs have to where like a harness or anything. I love handmade stuff and I’m fair enough to pay more money for that kind of quality and uniqueness. For dogs in growth (it doesn’t make sense wasting money there because the stuff fits like 2 weeks and then you need something new) I like the standard brands from „Fressnapf“ and so on...

**SpunkyJunky: Do you consider a dog bowl part of your house decoration?**

**Samanta:** Of course! The bowls from SpunkyJunky are eyecatchers and that’s exactly what I wanted. Sure, I have dogs and because of that, not have the cleanest house but I want it to look good anyway and the bowls are a big part of that because they match perfectly with our still.

**SpunkyJunky: Could you share your most interesting/funny story with Buddy and Ace? Or the thing that impressed you the most?**

**Samanta:** Most funny! I’m so ashamed haha. One year ago I was in Cote d’Azur (south France) with the dogs. We were wandering and it was soooo hot so I used every place where the dogs could go in the sea for a cooldown. At the end of our wander, we walked across a street with cocktail bars at the beach. There was a sign that dogs were not allowed, so I passed by. But behind the bar was a stairway… without any sign but it was the same beach. But without any sign, so… I walked down there with the dogs. The French people were very angry but I did like I don’t understand (what I didn’t because I don’t speak French). The dogs went to the water and lay down and… then buddy stood up and PEED in the water. On the forbidden beach with 50+ people around.

I was in Paris with the dogs too. You know the streets in Paris? Heavy! You just cannot pass the streets because of many cars and motorcycles. So we waited at the mainstreet for the traffic light to turn green. You have to hurry up because it turns green just for some seconds. We waited, then we ran (it was a street with 6 tracks. On the second track buddy hold on and… did a 💩 😂😂😂 and j just knew that I can’t stay there to clean it up but I can’t walk away because what the hell. So I stood there and was overwhelmed as fuck

I cleaned it up for sure but it was the most stressful situation in my life. My boyfriend and two best friends just waited at the other side of the street and laughed at me.

But I got my kiss on the Eiffel Tower!

**SpunkyJunky: What are your favorite pet accessories/treats you can't/don't want to live without?**

**Samanta:** Obviously, I can’t live without the bowls. But I also have my favorite harness and collar that I freaking love and I still have buddy’s first toy ever and can’t just throw it away. And I have a bracelet with Buddy on it that I really love. I just sent hair from Buddy, Ace, and my boyfriend to a company and will receive a handmade, unique necklace with the hair in it. I’ll love it for sure!

**SpunkyJunky: Anything else you want to share with readers?**

**Samanta:** I just talk about my experiences, ups, and downs, problems, training, and health,… they’re many people with the same problems but they think they have the fault, it’s about them and they have to do it on their own. But it’s not like that. You’re never alone and you’ll never fail when you’ll ask for help. That’s the big message I want to share with other dog people. It can be very hard sometimes, it will be for sure! But you can rock it, you can make it!",t2_uooi5qjw,0,(OC) Interview: Story of Buddy and Ace,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[News]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,news,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,True,,False,False,,{},[News],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,f39d87e4-1bae-11e6-98f1-0e0f2e7151b9,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#007373,zgsead,True,ethanthomas-,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zgsead/oc_interview_story_of_buddy_and_ace/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zgsead/oc_interview_story_of_buddy_and_ace/,2468831,1670577986,0,,False,1670578002,1670578003,2022-12-09 09:26:26,,,,,
242,dogs,"I just want to vent. We are okay but this morning me, my brother, and my small dog Daisy went on a walk around our neighborhood. I noticed this girl with her staffie was slowly walking on our side of the sidewalk but on the road approaching us. Her dog was already staring fixated at Daisy from a far, but I couldn’t cross cause my dog started to pee.
I wanted to tell her to cross the street and I should’ve but didn’t cause I was shocked and couldn’t believe what was happening.
They kept walking on the road towards us until they got close enough, that dog lunged, Daisy at the same time started barking at the dog. Thankfully we both were able to hold onto their leashes and no one broke free.
My brother later told me that she had crossed from the other side of the street to our side even though they had already seen us there.
I thought it’s common knowledge to give way and stay on the opposing side if there are other dogs walking? Even our trainer told us that it’s best not to meet dogs on walks if your don’t know them cause you never know what can happen.

243,dogs,"Hello everyone. 

Here’s a Jack Russel named Harvey who is 7 years old. 
He was first diagnosed with skin neoplasm back in July of 2019 and removed in October 2019. The second one appeared in September of 2022, removed on October 31st. Now he is fully recovered from the surgery and I guess I found a new one growing. 
Previous two turned out to be of benign nature. 

Back in September I asked a doctor if there’s any kind of therapy to prevent these from appearing again and she said no. When I found a new one yesterday, I went online and discovered that there are NO, LIKE ZERO, vet dermatologists in Russia.

250,dogs,"This is more of a Rant/see if anyone else has had anything like this happen since Covid, 

I’ve been ethically breeding  for a while now (6 years to be exact), I do everything that needs to be done, OFA health testing all breeding dogs Genetics included, showing &amp; Titling the works and I take SO much pride in that fact. 
My neighbors (right around the time COVID was happening), started showing a extreme interest in breeding they only had a Male GSD at this time. They started asking me just the basic questions which of course I’m happy to help educate on what needs done. 
The wife is a “Know it all” and simply kept asking how much money I was making with my breeding program and I explained to her several times over the last 2 years , the first 2 years I started out, I barley broke even, with health testing, traveling to AKC events, motel stays gas prices, then whelping supplies, having a attorney write up contracts, vet visits for the litters, etc. I barley broke even with everything I was doing the first 2 years.
The husband was kind of taken back by everything that needed done, and said that’s a lot of work. 
Fast FWD to recently The wife  just kepts insisting to me daily, when she sees me coming outside  of my house or out and about in our small town, her pure breed GSD “no papers” and her Female  GSD MIX, would produce excellent pups, and they didn’t need any health testing as vet said they were healthy. 
Her female GSD mix is only 8 months old at this time and she just recently got her at 3 months old this year. I told her that her female was still a puppy and not anywhere close to breeding quality, and her male didn’t even fit the breed standard set for the breed, (of course I’m a POS) because I’d pointed this out. 
Now here their female pup will be 9 months in January of 2023, and she has already started her “wait list” for litters on our local FB dog groups and just by word of mouth around our small town, her male is extremely other dog reactive and aggressive with animals and people and he HAS gotten off his lead and tried to attack not only my dogs but my child as well.
 I’ve complained to our local dog warden about her male getting loose And the fact (you need a kennel license to be a breeder in our county) at least that’s what I was told and had to pay for and keep for the past 6 years to be able to breed and the price tag for a Kennel license expensive PLUS the inspection they do, and how from FB posts it’s known my neighbors Maily the wife  are planning on breeding. The dog warden doesn’t seem to care about her male constantly terrifying my child when loose Or trying to attack my Show Dog’s, OR the fact You’re also “suppose” to have a state pet store license as well that’s another 500 yearly for that license even If you don’t produce more than 40 pups in 1 Calendar year. All this the  SAME dog warden had made me aware of to me when I was told I HAD to have a kennel license for our county. 
There is NOTHING more irritating than to work SO HARD, to be a reputable breeder and then have someone to set who has 0 experience with breeding ask questions, have the questions explained in Detail and then, STILL decide they know more and will do as they please and NO consequences will happen from them illegally breeding and back yard breeding.",t2_embh476f,0,Back yard breeding at its finest and we wonder why all breeds are in trouble.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zgqi9a,True,Jen_cakes_21,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zgqi9a/back_yard_breeding_at_its_finest_and_we_wonder/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zgqi9a/back_yard_breeding_at_its_finest_and_we_wonder/,2468806,1670571832,0,,False,1670571848,1670571849,2022-12-09 07:43:52,,,,,

258,dogs,"My 9 year old shiba inu had what appears to be a seizure yesterday (12/7). He was acting erratically, whimpering, tailed tucked in, &amp; having spasms in his chest &amp; front legs. He looked very confused &amp; panicked. It lasted about 5-10 minutes.
Then this evening around 9:15, he seemed to have another seizure, this time concentrated to his face. He looked confused, then stared into space, then started having facial spasms also lasting about 10 minutes. He ran upstairs &amp; peed, even though I had taken him out at 9, right before he had this episode.

He goes to doggy daycare while I work. So my options are: chance it and let him chill (literally ) in the car. I think he would be fine there. He’s a short hair but likes snow and cold
Put him in the apartment: and risk eviction when he howls his doggy head off for hours. Though he’s medicated now so it might be better
Board him at daycare. I really like this option except they kennel the dogs at night. What if that’s just as traumatizing for him as the kennel at home (home kennel was bad. In league with the devil bad)

I’m terrified to put her under general anesthesia. From my experience, vets I’ve asked are very cautious with their responses when you ask about the risk.

In my own personal experience with surgery and getting put under, doctors have always been super confident in telling me, “I’ll be fine!”, but it seems like I don’t get the same reassurance when it comes to my dog. Is the procedure different from humans (eg, do they constantly monitor the dog as they’re doing the procedure, etc)?

I’m also thinking that while they’re at it, it might be better to just do teeth cleaning. Will they be able to do it at the same time you think?

271,dogs,"So I live in an apartment, and am approved for three pets via an ESA letter from my doctor. I have a cat currently on my record at the apartment who does not live with me (ex decided to keep him after I listed him on the apartment paperwork) but I recently got a puppy. 

They are asking for updated vaccinations on the pets, but since I do not have the cat, I do not have his updated information. I have not yet brought my puppy to the vet as I gave her first vaccinations at home. So she has no official paperwork yet, but will within a month. 

Should I tell them that I have a puppy now instead? Since I am approved for three pets via ESA, I don’t think they could argue it. However, they require the pet being fixed to live on the premises. She is too young to get fixed. So I am worried they will tell me to get rid of her or try to make me move. 
Or should I just wait until she is old enough to spay and then submit the paperwork since I’m approved for three pets anyway? 

This is a large complex where they are unlikely to figure out she is here anyway. But I’m still concerned.

- Maltipoo mix, about 15yo, 19lbs, old, overweight, might have Cushings (not looking for medical advice)

I’ve had my Maltipoo on Wellness Complete Health Small Breed dry kibble for a couple years. He’s never really liked it and I’ve always had to encourage him to eat. 

We recently rescued the Yorkie and he also doesn’t like the Wellness kibble. I figured my Maltipoo just didn’t like kibble but now that the Yorkie doesn’t like it, I figure I should try something new. 

We also give them Fresh Pet chicken. My Maltipoo loves it and it always hungry (possibly due to Cushings)

I’m considering these, does anyone know if my dog might likes them more? Do other dogs dislike Wellness or just mine?

If yes, can SSRIs help, and is it a treatment worth considering? Full story follows… and I know to contact my vet to discuss more about treatment. I’m just wondering if this is even a viable option in veterinary science. Thanks!\n\nThe Long Version: I have an approximately 9 year old mixed breed, neutered rescue dog. We’ve had him since he was about two-ish, but never got a formal age. He’s maybe hound, lab mix. We’re not sure and never got him genetically tested. He’s about 35-40lbs (a smidgeon overweight when he’s about 40, but healthy at 35). \n\nHe is the smartest, cleverest, most enterprising dog. We had to install locks on the trash cans because he figured out how to use the pedal to open the lid. He figured out how to use his body to wiggle chairs from under the table to jump on them and then on the table. He was trained to use the buttons to talk to us. \n\nHe was also so full of energy and life. We would go on runs together, and he would drag me. He was constantly destroying toys, burying things in the back yard, begging for treats with 6,000 unprompted tricks. Every day he would sprint to the door with a toy to play when I got home from work. The last video I have of him before the events below, was him chasing snowballs like a fiend in the park. \n\nAbout 10 months ago, over the span of a week, he went blind. The ophthalmologist diagnosed him with SARDS after two appointments for retinal testing. The first two weeks, he wouldn’t move. He was afraid to jump off the couch or step down the stairs, probably because he didn’t know how far they were. He literally would just lay there until we coaxed him into moving. \n\nSince then, he’s gotten better. He’s learned commands for “step up”, “step down”, “jump up”, “jump down”, “stairs”, “this way”, etc. We’ve installed different textures to let him know where things like stairs are, and we’ve used scents to help identify different places. He’s mostly memorized the layout of our house and only gently bumps into corners and tables. He’s able to find his way in and out of his doggie door to pee on his own. \n\nBut he never recovered his spunky personality. He hasn’t played with a single toy since he went blind, even when I’ve filled them with treats or dipped them in peanut butter. He doesn’t wrestle with his 14yr old ‘brother’ dog, even when his brother tries to get him to play. He doesn’t snap or get mad. He just hangs his head and walks away. He obviously can’t see to use his talking buttons anymore. For a while he would try just hitting random ones, but then he gave up on that too. I can’t get him to run with me. I can’t get him to get excited and play with me, even without toys. He mostly just sleeps all day.\n\nPrior to going blind, he was a very healthy boy. We fully expected him to live to 12+, so I think he’s got a lot of life left in him. He’s had a full medical work up, including labs and orthopedic evaluations to make sure he wasn’t sick or injured. There’s nothing else going on. He just doesn’t have his spark anymore. Sometimes even getting him to eat his kibble is a chore, even though he’ll eat other high value treats or carrots if offered. He hasn’t lost weight, but it’s just an effort to get him to engage with life anymore. \n\nI’ve heard about SSRIs for dogs for separation anxiety. I’m wondering if my dog could be depressed because when he lost his vision, he also lost the ability to engage in things that brought him entertainment, communication, and joy. If dogs can get depressed, can the SSRIs used for anxiety be helpful for the symptoms? \n\nI worry that because he’s otherwise so healthy, he does have a long life left to live. But I don’t want that life to just be a source of frustration and unhappiness for him. I’ve seen videos of other blind dogs running and playing fetch and tumbling with their other dog friends. I just can’t seem to convince him to do those things anymore, and I don’t know how to help him beyond what we’re already doing.\n\nI gave it almost a year because I knew it would take time for him to adapt to his new disability, but I guess I just expected something…anything more by now. If I just need to give it more time, I can do that. I’m just looking for ways to help him. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post. I just love him so much, and it breaks my heart to see him suffering. I can cope with him being blind, but the despondency is so hard to watch. So, if you have any advice, I’ll take it. (Except putting him down. I won’t do that.)

Every day he would sprint to the door with a toy to play when I got home from work. The last video I have of him before the events below, was him chasing snowballs like a fiend in the park. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 months ago, over the span of a week, he went blind. The ophthalmologist diagnosed him with SARDS after two appointments for retinal testing. The first two weeks, he wouldn’t move. He was afraid to jump off the couch or step down the stairs, probably because he didn’t know how far they were. He literally would just lay there until we coaxed him into moving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, he’s gotten better. He’s learned commands for “step up”, “step down”, “jump up”, “jump down”, “stairs”, “this way”, etc. We’ve installed different textures to let him know where things like stairs are, and we’ve used scents to help identify different places. He’s mostly memorized the layout of our house and only gently bumps into corners and tables. He’s able to find his way in and out of his doggie door to pee on his own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he never recovered his spunky personality. He hasn’t played with a single toy since he went blind, even when I’ve filled them with treats or dipped them in peanut butter. He doesn’t wrestle with his 14yr old ‘brother’ dog, even when his brother tries to get him to play. He doesn’t snap or get mad. He just hangs his head and walks away. He obviously can’t see to use his talking buttons anymore. For a while he would try just hitting random ones, but then he gave up on that too. I can’t get him to run with me. I can’t get him to get excited and play with me, even without toys. He mostly just sleeps all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to going blind, he was a very healthy boy. We fully expected him to live to 12+, so I think he’s got a lot of life left in him. He’s had a full medical work up, including labs and orthopedic evaluations to make sure he wasn’t sick or injured. There’s nothing else going on. He just doesn’t have his spark anymore. Sometimes even getting him to eat his kibble is a chore, even though he’ll eat other high value treats or carrots if offered. He hasn’t lost weight, but it’s just an effort to get him to engage with life anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard about SSRIs for dogs for separation anxiety. I’m wondering if my dog could be depressed because when he lost his vision, he also lost the ability to engage in things that brought him entertainment, communication, and joy. If dogs can get depressed, can the SSRIs used for anxiety be helpful for the symptoms? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worry that because he’s otherwise so healthy, he does have a long life left to live. But I don’t want that life to just be a source of frustration and unhappiness for him. I’ve seen videos of other blind dogs running and playing fetch and tumbling with their other dog friends. I just can’t seem to convince him to do those things anymore, and I don’t know how to help him beyond what we’re already doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave it almost a year because I knew it would take time for him to adapt to his new disability, but I guess I just expected something…anything more by now. If I just need to give it more time, I can do that. I’m just looking for ways to help him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for the long post. I just love him so much, and it breaks my heart to see him suffering. I can cope with him being blind, but the despondency is so hard to watch. So, if you have any advice, I’ll take it. (Except putting him down. I won’t do that.)

281,dogs,"I have two large, older dogs - both around 6-7 years old. One was a rescue that was adopted from a kill shelter after our 10 year old terrier passed away suddenly. The second one was one I agreed to adopt from a relative who couldn’t take care of him any more because of declining physical health. #1 is a catahoula mix, #2 is a boxer/lab mix. They are both prone to boredom it seems. Most posts I see on this subject the dog is no older than two years old so I feel like an outlier.

Our daily routine:

- 6:45: wake up, out to potty in the backyard
- 7:00: 45 minute walk and quick romp in the backyard, e.g. tug of war or fetch.
- 7:45: Breakfast served in a frozen Kong.
- 8:00: I drop four puzzle toys onto the floor for them to be occupied after breakfast while I’m at work. Usually two more kongs with frozen peanut butter and a couple plastic puzzle toys that I rotate in and out. I leave for work.
- 4:00pm: Dinner (in their bowls)
- 4:30-5:30: They usually take a nap and I get myself dinner
- 6:00-7:30: I get my things ready for the next day and get their breakfast ready to freeze
- 7:30-9:00 - I leave to go work out. Sometimes I’ll get home around 8:30 depending on how long it takes me at the gym.
- 9:00: evening walk. Slower paced and allowed to sniff. If it’s not rainy or too cold, they get to run in an open field for a bit. Usually 45 minutes to an hour. 
- 10:00pm: time to calm down. Sometimes get something to chew on. Sometimes play a couple rounds of hide and seek with something tasty like cut up uncured hotdogs.
- 11:00pm: bedtime.

Here’s my issue: Even though I take very minimal time to myself, I can’t seem to adequately stimulate them. They are always ready to go go go. Foot always on the gas. The only real time they spend alone is when I go to work. During the short periods of downtime, they’re still trying to wrestle or pace around looking for things to do. 

I have been taking two approaches. Hiding in a room they can’t see or hear me (like the bathroom, I feel like this is sad and kinda funny for a grownup to hide in the bathroom from their pets but I have zero breathing room sometimes) or being very firm with them to go lay down followed by a treat when they’re calm. Usually this works but only for a short while and they start pacing again so I have to do it again.

I’m not very experienced with training dogs so I’m at such a loss. I’ve had both of them for a year and a half. I determined this routine several months ago and it’s the only thing I can seem to stick to since I can multitask on things for me and them. Still, I feel like I’m taking next to zero time to myself just to relax. Again, foot never touches the brakes. I’m starting to burn out. I can’t afford doggy daycare, at least not in my area. Does anyone have any ideas to tire them out more quickly? I have so many puzzle toys and I’d rather not get a bunch more if I don’t have to. My friends and family have had dogs around this age or even younger and it always seems like they’re calm and relaxed most of the time. I feel so envious.

293,dogs,"TLDR: Luna is a 3 yr old pitbull mix that ive had for 1 year now, she has had issues since I got her and it's been a slow struggle to correct some behaviors and now I can't take her to my first apartment and no family members want to take her. She has severe separation anxiety. Will she get majorly depressed if I rehome her? I love her. It breaks my heart, but I can't give her the attention she needs to correct her bad behaviors. Thanks!

I hate that I have to rehome my dog Luna, she's about 3 years old, she's a pitbull mix, and she's adorable, but she was never properly potty trained until she I got her at 2 years old! She would go to the bathroom all over the house, including the couches, beds, even her crate! And this was all while I lived with my parents... they were not happy. Then we moved, and so far, she has scratched up 3 doors, ripped apart a corner of the carpet. She also ate food from the kitchen and bedrooms when nobody is around. We have another dog that, and sometimes i think he doesn't like her because it looks like she always bullys him when he's chillin'. On the flip side, she can be extremely loving, super cuddly, and very cute. In additon to those she has extreme separation anxiety so if the doors are closed because me and the one I love are wrestling, Luna will scratch and scratch and wine until it's opened, it seems like she hates to be left alone. Lastly i have to rehome her because none of mh family members want her and im moving to an apartment where pitbulls are restricted so i cant take her and honestly if i could take her, i am not willing to take her as much as i love her, she causes so much stress and damage to the house.

296,dogs,"Hi everyone,

My younger dog keeps eating my older dog's poop when no one is watching. I've tried several things to make him stop like feeding them both ""No chew poo bites"" which is suppose to make poop taste nasty. It worked for a bit, but now they're ineffective. Tried bitter spray, but he never eats it when we can see him so it's hard to catch him in the act.

He only eats poop when we are not in sight and this is only indoors when our older dog poops on the pad. He never tries to eat random poop or things off the ground during walks either, it's solely just my older dog's indoor poops.

Any ideas?

Please don't say to ween them off pads permanently, my older dog is a very fickle eater so he eats when he feels like it which makes it hard to time his poops exactly.

300,dogs,"Hello fellow redditors! 

I'll attempt to make it quick but there are too many details.

I have an 11 month old male Germany Shepherd named Kai. Very large (95 lbs) and very protective. Today I decided to walk him up the street.

I haven't in two months because this sweet old lady up the street has an Australian Shepherd that would charge us every walk, and with Kaiser getting larger, it just made things difficult. It would leave her yard and follow us down the road 100 ft or so, Kai attempting to kill this dog while I carry him home.

Back to today, I decided to brave the storm. We get to the house, dog is chained up at the top of the hill. Kai starts barking, I say No in the serious voice, he puts those ears down and listens. Had to repeat 2 or 3 times but I was a proud dog dad. Successful walk ammaright? Almost.

On the way home, Kai is looking up the hill, ears up but not barking. ""Wow wow wow. What a good boy,"" I say to myself. About that time, on the opposite side of the street, different neighbors had their front door open and two pitbulls charged me and Kai. 

I'm a firefighter by trade, so I've made a quick decision or two, and I've also seen/heard how situations with dogs can end (doesn't help that pitbulls have a bad wrap for this sort of thing). 

So what happened? I pick Kai up and walked towards the yard across the street (yes, home to the annoying Australian Shepherd) and yelled for the woman on the porch to grab her dogs. Good news for me, these dogs weren't looking to inflict damage, they were looking to play. Unfortunately for them, Kai was not in the playing mood. He was attempting to get down (kicking, barking, biting at them, etc) as I was holding him and the dogs kept jumping on me. This went on for 30 seconds or so before her sons (just assuming cause age) came and dragged the dogs in. Kaiser, myself, the pitbulls...all parties were physically ok, other than my shorts I was wearing now have several cuts (idk who from). 

I took Kai home, put him inside, and went back to have a talk with this woman. When I got there, she was in a near panic attack. I talked her down, told her everything was going to be ok, and got her breathing normal again. 

I told her that the situation should have been avoided and that in TN, dogs have to be on your property, and they obviously can't just be charging people. She kept saying how they're so protective because a male dog attacked her. Nicely, I told her that it doesn't matter, they need to stay on her property. 

The nicest way I've ever said ""I was considering shooting your dog in self defense,"" was by saying ""I'm sure your dogs are sweet, but anyone being charged by two pitbulls and attempting to run away would be well within their rights to protect themselves by any means necessary."" 

I've carried since I was 21 and never even thought about pulling it out, until today. I NEVER want it to come to that, human, dog, etc. 

So here's possible solutions on where we go from here considering this situation is over;
1. I could walk to where their property is and ensure that there's no Pitbulls/Australian Shepherd present but even if I do, there's no guarantee they won't be then when I come back with Kai.
2. I keep a watchful eye and call up one of the officers I know and deal with it that way.
3. I give up on walking my dog in my street completely and deffer to care rides to different places, although many people still don't follow laws in public areas.
4. Strap my AR pistol to my leg as an open carry pistol for defense when walking down my street (halfway joking)

308,dogs,"So I have two dogs, the one I’ve had before goes both outside/inside without a problem. When he goes inside he goes on the pads with no accidents.

My newer dog, only goes consistently outside. I take her out in the morning and after work but sometimes when I take her out she doesn’t go. And there were times where I waited for her to do her business but doesn’t go for ~10mins before I have to back to get ready to leave for work and etc. on those days she pees and poops inside (which I don’t mind at all) but not on the pads. Which just leads to a mess on our carpet/rugs.

I feel bad cause sometimes she holds it in and I don’t want her to develop kidney stones or have urinary infections or such. I want her to know it’s ok to go inside if she has to go but I’d prefer her to go on the pads we have in the apartment. 

She has used the pads like 2 times ever and when she did we rewarded her but she’s never been encouraged do use them again or felt comfortable using them I guess

I still take them out to go do their business but are there any tips to guide her to use the pads when we aren’t available?

My older dog already was potty trained when we got him so I’m still learning on how to train her myself.

309,dogs,"Hi, was scrolling through petfinder in my area and came across a group of puppies whose breed is a big question mark (found as strays). As we are starting to consider adoption, we know that mixed breed is par for the course and I'm just trying to familiarize myself with more breeds and their characteristics as we have a couple of parameters for ourselves in terms of size, shedding, etc, but we do still want to rescue vs go with a breeder. I know breed ID from photos especially for puppies is really difficult, but curious what you'd guess for these pups listed as lab mixes, given the curly / wiry coats and the head/ear shapes? They were found in the south if that makes you more or less likely to consider a certain breed (e.g., my iphone app identifies some of the photos as Newfoundlands but not sure those are as common in the southern states; it also says flat-coated retriever but I understand that breed isn't really that common at all).

Murphy is a shar pei, pug, beagle mix, and being that we got him when he was 8 weeks old and have no children he’s our family and we love him dearly. 

A little about him is he hates the vet, even though they provide great care for him and love him too, it’s just the natural dislike for the doctors for him. Our vet discussed options for him. We know the overall prognosis isn’t good. We’re considering chemotherapy but just wondering if it’s worth it, not so much the cost, but more about his quality of life. We know it’s probably not a cure for him, but just interested if it’ll be worth it as to buying more time/giving him a better quality of life vs. palliative care (steroids, pain killers, etc.).

I took her to the vet who performed an fna and said she saw white blood cells and wasn't alarmed.  Said it was most likely a reaction to a vaccine she got 4 weeks prior.  Per my documents she got lepto/Lyme and bordetella vaccines.  Vet said to give a call if it gets bigger, or if it doesn't get smaller within a few weeks.

325,dogs,"Was hoping to get some suggestions and insight from any other owns of rescues here!

Just adopted a 4-year old small rescue chihuhua/jack russel last week. He's fantastic - adorable, loves to lay/cuddle, was immediately friendly and latched on to me. He is extremely calm and chill, loves other dogs (only barked once with a bigger one who started barking at him first lol) and loves people. Is not really a big barker in general.

However, I've been trying to keep him in the crate in my apartment when I leave. He is a total mess in it. Now let me preface this by saying I tried hard to adapt him to the crate - had him eat in there, had him lay in there (it's next to my desk) during the day - he's totally fine with that. He just walks right in on his own and lays down. So I don't believe this is a crate issue. Seems to be more of a separation issue - and given the circumstances, I totally understand. But basically once I'm gone for more than 5 minutes when he's in the crate, he realizes, and then freaks out (barks, cries, messes up the pee pad, tries to scratch the bars to get out, etc.) I got a doggy cam so I could watch him while i'm gone. Normally, this would just be something that takes time and I wouldn't be worried about it. But given that I'm in an apartment complex, I'm unsure of how thick the walls are (I think they're pretty thick, but you never know) and I worry about him barking up a storm when I'm gone.

Unfortunately, this seems to extend to just in general being gone. He likes to follow me around and he likes to keep me in his sight. The most I can leave him in another room without him getting up to find me is a few minutes. I even just had him out and about in the apartment and I left to take the trash out for literally 2 minutes. He was already barking at the door. I assume he has a history of being afraid that he's being left alone, so I get it.  But any tips on helping dogs with separation anxiety (outside meds, which I will inquire with my vet about too), but just to keep them calmer in the crate as well?

327,dogs,"My 4.5 year old dog just had TPLO surgery today. They are keeping her overnight but the vet called to discuss the surgery with me. He mentioned seeing arthritis on the xray which is probably due to her having the injury for so long. He also talked about doing a meniscus release but that they couldn't find a meniscus during surgery. He said this has never happened to him in all his years and he isn't really sure what to say about it. I asked him if he assumed it was related to her injury and he said it's probable. 

I'm feeling extreme guilt for not getting her surgery sooner. She was intermittently limping earlier this year (april may) and by the time I called our main vet we had to wait a month and a half for an appointment. I live in very rural area which means there are only 2 vets in a 2 hour drive that do the tplo surgery so our vet told me to pick one. After meeting with the first vet I knew I wanted a second option. Every interaction I had at that office was very messy and when I finally met the surgeon he kept talking about the wrong leg for surgery. I specifically asked him about her exercise levels and he told us not to restrict her movements. 

Finally in November I had an appointment with the second surgeon and I was comfortable with him doing the procedure. He he laid out all the information and was incredibly informative and patient. He did tell me to start restricting her activity and to start feeding her less as he thinks her ideal weight is less than her current weight. 

Part of me knows I've done the best I can in the situation. Another part of me loves this dog more than anything and can't let go of the fact that my actions have contributed to her problems. Any advice or reassurance for me?

331,dogs,"Hi, just a quick question on how to solve this issue. I brought home a 7 week old kitten two weeks ago, I have a small dog (a Bichon frise) who is 6 years old. At the start they weren’t getting along and were both scared of each other. However after a little while and lots of work they started warming up to each other, sleeping next to each other. Following each other around etc, my kitten kept looking on edge or cautious as did my dog. However something has changed, now it’s like my kitten is overly confident. Any chance she gets she runs out of nowhere and attacks my dog, I normally grab her at the last second before she does. Which I think could be making it worse?

332,dogs,"My dog was diagnosed with Cushing's Disease a few months before his 7th birthday. We caught it quickly and started treatment. He is on 45 mg of Trilostane, CBD oil (he already had really bad anxiety that got worse with his Cushing's), melatonin, and I switched his diet to Darwin's Pet Raw Food (which I cook at a very low temperature before feeding to him to avoid stomach issues).   


It took about 6 months, but he is now back to his previous weight and his cortisone levels are in the middle of the normal range. He seems really happy and healthy, aside from his hair still not growing back in places it was shaved and heat intolerance, but I live in South Florida, so I think everyone experiences heat intolerance.  


I was wondering if anyone had a dog diagnosed around the same age that responded well to treatment and lived past the two year mark? I've been too nervous to ask my vet about life expectancy. Everywhere I've researched says life expectancy past diagnosis is up to two years, but I know it's usually diagnosed in older dogs. I rescued my dog when he was 5 weeks old and he's such an important member of the family. He goes to work with me everyday, comes to my parent's house when we visit, and comes for rides to anywhere I have to do a drive through.

337,dogs,"Hey, I’ll be honest, I kinda totally introduced my cat and dog to my friends cat the totally wrong way. 

Okay so, my friends dad basically kicked the cat out because hes a asshole. Although my friend and their mom are saving money up to get their own place, and like , my friend had no other options but to ask me and I love my friend and dont want them losing their cat. so I said yes, and at first I kept the dog upstairs, and my cat whom is a adult, was introduced to the kitten when the kitten was in a cage, I looked up how were supposed to introduce them and totally fucked up without doing the door thing. 

So on, I decided maybe I should have them eat near eachother? and that didnt work out, the kitten hissed and hissed and was obviously scared. (hes only 4 months old) my cat though didnt mind him at first, though when it was later on and my cat started getting kinda aggressive? he would follow the cat and walk slowly towards it, but never really attacked? though a few times they jumped at eachother but ran away. by the way the kitten is a male and my cat is a male but neutered (kitten isnt) 

Anyways, my dog is a VERY hyper dog, who I love but also need to train which ive been working on, though with school i always get so tired and can only have  enough energy to take her on her daily walk. I finally got her house trained and she does well with my cat expect when shes on her period, she’ll try humping him and chasing him, so I separate the two. (shes not neutered yet) 

Anyways, when I was getting water for the cat, my dog ran downstairs, i prayed to god she wouldnt hurt him. Although when I got down there the cat was a poor scared baby who RAN, and her being a dog and seeing a cat run, she too ran and chased but for fun, shes never hurt my cat. and the cat was really scared so I put the dog upstairs, and she whined and whined because 1 she couldnt be with me 2 there was a cat. So on I got in trouble because winter was barking and screaming, and im trying really hard because I dont want my parents to say we cant take care of him until my friend can take him back. 

I just let her smell the basement area where he was, (put him upstairs for a bit) and she calmed down, shes aware he was here but im not sure if she thinks hes still here, because shes laying down very nicely right now.

338,dogs,"So I've own my dog for 8 years, he was a birthday gift from my parents and the first ever dog I've owned. I love him dearly and obviously grown really attached to him. But unfortunately due to lack of training he is somewhat aggressive and suffers horrendous separation anxiety. He's bitten quite a few people in the past, and recently bite my father's girlfriend. With my father girlfriend moving in and her having a young energetic daughter my dog constantly barks at. Unfortunately we had to give him to my grandma, in fear of my dogs aggressive behavior. While it was really hard for me to rehome him like that, I knew it was best for him. But now my dog's aggression and separation anxiety is causing a big problem for my grandma, to him constantly crying when she leaves him alone, that the neighbors often complain about, and to biting another dog while they were on a walk. And overall him just being happy stuck in a apartment. It's left us in a dilemma on what should we do with him. But recently one of my grandma's friends liked my dog and wanted to take him to live in his 4 acre land with a bunch of other dogs. While as much as it hurts me, I know this would be a better environment for him. But it just hurts to give away my dog of 8 years.

He was dirty as hell, had bugs all over him and was clearly not in the best shape, thankfully i have a cat in the house so I was able to give him a shower with a sensitive pet shampoo.  


I have had a chance to call a local shelter, and they will be picking him up, however in the meantime, the dog is currently wailing/crying and im not sure why (I've never owned a dog before). I tried giving him dog treats, water, and food.

343,dogs,I am researching on how to get an older puppy (6 months to a year old). I have allergies so originally I was going to adopt a 9 week old toy poodle puppy at the end of April but I realized that a puppy that young would be too stressful for me. I still want to get a hypoallergenic pup but a little older in April but I'm not sure on what exactly I should do to achieve that whether to go to a breeder and see if they have any older pups or go through a shelter.

355,dogs," I’ve (30M) recently gotten romantically involved with someone who has a little chihuahua with some trauma history. She has some affection for my SO and will come to her with some nervousness, but is still terrified of literally everything and everyone else. She’ll hide under furniture in the presence of anyone but my SO. She pees on strangers when she’s picked up. She won’t eat or go potty willingly if she knows someone’s around, even my SO. She’s on a potent anti-anxiety medication that apparently helps.

I want her dog to feel comfortable with me. However, as afraid as she is of strangers, she's piss-herself-terrified of men, and unfortunately I was no exception. The first time I watched her on my own, she immediately pissed herself then cowered in the corner of the opposite side of the room for the entire day she was with me. She startled even if I crossed my legs. She ran in fear if I made any movement in her direction.

We made some progress after I changed my behavior to accommodate her anxiety. I no longer make any sudden movements around her, I leave her alone with food so she would eat and go potty, etc. Now, she no longer runs away or pisses herself at the sight of me. She backpedals just one or two steps when I move toward her rather than sprint to the other side of the room. She’s even allowed me to approach her and pick her up.

But with all that being said, monitoring my behavior for her comfort has been extremely exhausting. Sometimes I feel like it might be getting in the way of my relationship with my SO, even though she likes that her dog has somewhat warmed up to me. Is there anything I can do to make things easier?

364,dogs,"(20F) Hi there, I'm having this put on a throwaway so its harder for my parents to find. They can be controlling so i'd rather them not find out about this. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I am very desperate and running out of options here.

My parents (mom and step dad) have impulse bought a dog about 2 years ago, a female lab/pit mix. She was very energetic and smart when we got her and loved to run and play. Now, she mostly sits on a couch and huffs whenever I try to play with her.

My parents work fulltime jobs and come home to immediately watch TV and sleep. They don't have friends or really do anything, but this is all for another day. We have gotten into screaming matches where I have almost been kicked out because I've had to remind my parents that dogs need to be walked. They aggressively and outwardly refuse to walk her, even on vacation and on days off of work. They claim that dogs don't need it and she gets her exercise outside. Well... We used to have a yard until my parents decided to replace the entire plot with brick. We live in a city, so our yard space is very small and limited. She doesn't have much room to run around or play, and usually goes outside to lay down on the pavement. When summers hit where we live, it can become scorching hot so the pavement of course heats up. When I brought this up to my mom, she shrugged it off and said that ""she'll love our yard when we move out."" (they plan to move in 2 years...)

They give her an extremely poor diet, and its one of the key contributors to her obesity. They put cheese in her food ""so she eats it"", and when she gets sick from it they put rice in her bowl. She has constant constipation and issues with diarrhea because of it. I brought up to my mom in text today that she's getting really overweight and she hasn't been to a vet since we got her. (they also refuse to take her to the vet.) She replied with, ""I'm figuring out bills. I'll give her one scoop of food instead of 1 1/2""

Other small things include screaming at her, kicking her, ignoring her, leaving her alone for hours at a time, refusing to trim her nails at all, refusing to treat her bumble foot, and refusing to take her to the vet. There may be more that I'm missing...but you get the idea.

But the icing on the cake is that my step dad is a hoarder. If it wasn't for my mom being the only one to clean (i'm not allowed to because I would throw all of their junk away.) the house would be condemned. Theres very very little space for the pup to run around in, despite the house being a level 5 hoard. He's also a cop, so I fear that he will take some sort of legal action, even if that fear is irrational.

I don't know what else to do. I have tried to be there for her as much as I can, being playing with her and spending as much time with her as I can. But.. I can't take her on walks due to my severe phobia of feces. (and i mean SEVERE.) Feel free to get on me for that, but its why I would never purchase a dog. Its why I desperately want her rehomed, as I know I would not be a proper canidate to take care of her. On top
of that, i'm not a dog person at all. She deserves to be in the best home she can be in. 

I want to rehome her so badly, but i'm terrified of my parents' retaliation, however i''m at the point where I don't care anymore and need to help this dog out. I have no idea where to start with calling, as i'm afraid they'll ignore me like they did my previous reports. (I called ASPCA and they didnt bother to investigate.) I'm just hopeless and scared for this poor pup. Any advice helps, I just want this doggo in a good and loving home. I moreso need to know whats the best service to call.

My dog (pit/lab mix) is 12.5 years old. She has a large tumor on her spleen that is inoperable, so all we can do is love her until she passes. However she’s had this tumor for a little over a year with minimal health complications. She’s usually a pretty lively dog (wags her tail, rolls around, likes pets), but also has some noticeable discomfort. On the other hand, it can be hard to get her to go outside, she’s becoming incontinent, there’s is blood in her urine (related to her health issues), and her vision is declining…she’s also becoming a bit more aggressive. Some days I see her being a normal dog and think she’s fine! But others, I see the discomfort, exhaustion, and struggle to simply stand up. I don’t want my baby to suffer, but I also don’t want to prematurely end a life. I’m not looking for medical treatment advice.

381,dogs,"Hi everyone. Would love to hear your thoughts, whether you’re an experienced dog owner or vet. Please read details below, my questions are at the bottom!

Drogo: Siberian Husky, 68 lbs. DOB: 2/13/2021. ~2 yrs

Koda: Siberian Husky, 65 lbs. DOB: 1/22/2017 ~ 6 yrs

Both dogs are unrelated. 

June 20, 2022: Drogo had his first grand mal or generalized seizure, lasting around 1 minute. Bloodwork was fine, Cardio BNP levels were high.

July 20, 2022: Koda has his first and only grand mal or generalized seizure, lasting around 1-2 minutes. Bloodwork was fine.

July 21, 2022: About 14 hours after Koda’s first seizure, Drogo had his second seizure.

Since then, Drogo has had a seizure about every 4-5 weeks. All the same in nature. Bloodwork has always looked good, cardiologist found no heart issues, and his MRI and spinal tap were both clear. The neurologist diagnosed him with genetic/idiopathic epilepsy and that it was a mere coincidence that Koda also has epilepsy and had his first seizure just hours before Drogo’s second.

From his first neuro appointment in September to his last appointment on Nov 21st, he was taking 750mg of Keppra twice daily. Since there were no improvements, during his MRI appointment on Nov 21st, we have doubled his dosage to 1500mg of Keppra twice daily. Despite that, he had another seizure this morning (12/8/2022).

So in total, 7 confirmed seizures and 2 suspected seizures, that’s 9 in 6 months. I have a very hard time accepting the idiopathic epilepsy, I still think there may be something environmental in my home that’s triggering this. I’m not questioning the diagnosis in any way, I just can’t live not knowing the cause. Here are my questions:

1.      Is there anything else we can do in terms of testing or checking our home for anything that’s causing the seizures? Note: we are renting and have noticed a mold issue in the home. It was built in 1989 and isn’t in the best shape – it’s always been rented with very few updates.
 
2.      A week prior, we were in an area that is known for ticks. The testing for ticks came back negative, but I know there can be false reports. If it were a tick related issue – would we be seeing more symptoms? Or would it at this point cause encephalitis – which would show in the MRI?
 
3.      Is there such thing as a vet urologist? Do you think it might be worth looking into?
 
4.      What other medications should I try? I liked Keppra because it doesn’t cause liver issues, but I know there has been some debate about its efficacy. I did see that there are some third generation anti-convulsants that have had high success rates and minimal side effects. Anything that’s out of the testing phase that we could try?

Please, even if you spit-ball ideas to me, I just want to cross off all possibilities. I’m a young dog owner and have spent too much money at this point to have no idea what’s triggering his seizures.

Thank you in advance, I appreciate you reading this far!

383,dogs,"We have been looking for another dog to fill our home and came to the decision between adopting a puppy or rescuing a dog from a local shelter. We have been specifically looking for a corgi to bring home as we already have another corgi. 

We previously adopted our second dog from this shelter last year under the impression it was a corgi mix, and to our surprise over time, we learned it was actually a spit chow and is now 3x the size of our first dog, a corgi.

Our biggest concern is that the shelter doesn't really know what kind of breed the dogs are and often make the best guess effort, even though that can mean that the dog is significantly larger than it was expected to be... which is what happened with our spit chow mix and we ended up with more than we bargained for, but he is our family for life and we won't trade him for the world.

While we love our spit chow mix, he attacks our corgi often with high energy, and it is a bit too much. Our hope is level the playing field and make their interactions easier ongoing by adding a third pup to our home.

We are going to be looking at a corgi puppy tomorrow morning and the corgi mix puppy in the afternoon tomorrow. Both are the same price for the adoption fee. The corgi mix puppy at the shelter is already the same weight as our 4 year old corgi now and very clearly has a predominant breed of an Australian cattle dog. He is going to be a big boy for sure.

If we end up choosing the corgi ""purebred"" puppy, I am not sure how to break the news to the shelter... and morally, I feel so bad about the situation. My concern is the wellbeing of our home and the happiness of our dogs in general, and adding yet another unknown mixed breed could be chaotic.

Are you ready to start training your dog or puppy? Proper training and socialization are among your dog's basic needs. It's important to start training your dog as soon as possible to sit, stay, come, go to their crate, and to go potty outside. And believe it or not, it's something you can do yourself as a beginner.

At first, dog training can seem pretty overwhelming, especially if this is your first dog. The truth is that training your dog is a very big project. If you take it step by step, you will find the task to be far less daunting. Here is some information to help get you started:

· Start a Dog Obedience Program: Learn how to set a basic foundation before you begin to train your dog.

· Train Your Dog Using Games: Training your dog should be fun! Everyone knows it's easier to learn when you are having a good time, so try implementing some games into your dog training regimen.

· Six Weeks to a Well-Trained Dog: Using this schedule as a guide, you can teach your dog the basics in about six weeks.

· Positive Reinforcement: There are many different ways to train a dog, but most dog professionals agree that the positive way is the best for both the dog and trained

House Training and Crate Training

Unless you plan to keep your dog outdoors—and few of us do because it's not recommended—you'll need to teach your dog where to eliminate. Therefore, house training (also called housebreaking or potty training) is one of the first things you need to work on with your dog. Crate training can be a very helpful part of the training process. This includes house training as well as many other areas of training:

· Crate Training Dogs and Puppies: Here are the basics of training your dog or puppy to accept and even enjoy the crate. Not only will it help with housebreaking, but it will also give your dog a place of his own.

· How to House Train your Dog: When it comes down to it, house training is not that complicated, but this doesn't mean it's easy. Consistency and diligence are key during the housebreaking process.

· Submissive/Excitement Urination in Dogs: If your dog is still having accidents in the house, it may be more than a simple housebreaking issue. Your dog might urinate out of excitement or to express submissive behavior.

Leash Training Dogs and Puppies

Every dog needs to learn to walk on a leash. Besides the fact that most areas have leash laws, there will be times when keeping your dog on a leash is for his own safety. Learn how to introduce your dog or puppy to the leash, then teach him how to walk properly on the leash, even beside you on a bike. A loose leash walk teaches your dog not to pull or lunge when on ​the leash, making the experience more enjoyable for both you and your dog.

How To Socialize Dogs and Puppies

Socialization means training your puppy or adult dog to accept new people, animals, and various places by exposing him to these things. Socialized dogs are less likely to develop behavior problems and are generally more welcomed by others. Socialization can also help prevent the development of fears and phobias.

The bottom line is that socializing your dog or puppy will make him a happier, more well-behaved dog.

Clicker Training for Dogs

Clicker training, a common form of positive reinforcement, is a simple and effective dog training method. Although it is still fine to train your dog without clicker training, many people find it helpful. With clicker training, you can easily and effectively teach your dog all kinds of basic and advanced commands and tricks. It's fast and easy to learn how to clicker train your dog

Basic Commands and Fun Tricks

There are some basic dog training commands and dog tricks that every dog should know like come, speak, drop it, stay, back up, etc. Basic commands give your dog structure. In addition, they can help you overcome common dog behavior problems and will help keep your dog safe.

How to Train Your Dog to Stay

What's more fun than showing off your dog's cool tricks?! Dog tricks are a great way to take your dog training to the next level and give your dog some mental stimulation.

Proofing Behaviors and Troubleshooting

Proofing is the last step in training your dog to do any new behavior. Learn how to proof behaviors so your dog will be as obedient at the park or a friend's house is he is in your own living room.

Remember, just because you have reached the final stages of training, it doesn't mean that behavior problems won't crop up. Learn about the most common dog behavior problems and how to deal with them. These guides will help you navigate this part of the training process:

· Proofing Behaviors: Practice behaviors in a variety of situations with different levels of distraction. Without proofing, your dog may behave well in your living room, but seem to forget all his training when he is outside the house.

· Teach Your Dog Self-Control: This method teaches your dog that nothing in life is free, but that he needs to earn things like food and attention through obedience.

· Common Dog Behavior Problems: Understanding potential behavior issues can help you detect and address them before things get out of control.

· Dog Behavior Management Versus Dog Training: While dog behavior management and dog training are two different things, they are not mutually exclusive. Behavior management is an important part of any dog training program.

Advanced Dog Training

Once your dog has mastered all the basics, you can consider moving on to more advanced tricks. These activities will help keep your dog active, fit and mentally stimulated. Plus, they will help strengthen the bond you share with your canine companion.

Remember that training is an ongoing process. You will never be completely finished. It is important to keep working on obedience training throughout the life of your dog. People who learn a language at a young age but stop speaking that language may forget much of it as they grow older. The same goes for your dog: use it or lose it. Running through even the most basic tricks and commands will help them stay fresh in your dog's mind. Plus, it's a great way to spend time with your dog.",t2_ujcr855e,0,How to train Your dog completely,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zg36ab,True,Curt_Store,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zg36ab/how_to_train_your_dog_completely/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zg36ab/how_to_train_your_dog_completely/,2468305,1670515586,0,,False,1670515604,1670515605,2022-12-08 16:06:26,,,,,
387,dogs,"Throwaway account as I am unsure what to do next. I adopted my dog 3 years ago this coming February she will also be 4 by then. When I first got her she was timid and nervous which I assumed meant she needed some time to decompress as most if not all newly adopted dogs do. Within the first year, I managed to build enough trust to take her to some training to start building structure and confidence. Move forward to now and the last 8-12 months have been progressively worse, we did more training yet things like leash manners are still non existent depsite practice, she still tries to interact with every dog she walks by but the major problem is she constantly whines. If i put on clothes she whines (even if I move to the couch), if I come out of the shower she whines, if shes in the car she whines (till I put the window down then she whines if theres no wind), if we stop at an intersection to cross she whines. Basically the whining is driving me mental and I am on the verge of giving her up as I am going crazy. She is healthy, I did full bloodwork and a checkup there is no underlying issue that is causing the whining it appears to be behavioural. 

I am looking for ANY advice or recommendations, I am in Toronto, ON but willing to do online work with someone if it will bring any progress. I love her but I am going crazy and more and more feeling she is not the right fit in my home but want to make sure I am making the right decision whatever I do next..

390,dogs,"I just wanted to share this story because it shook me, but it also made me feel loved. Also to say that even though he's a puppy still, he's still pretty big at 50lbs. He's part Husky and might be part German shepherd. There was no harm to anything or anyone in this story.

This happened an hour after feeding time at 10:30pm when he usually needs to go out to do his business. I live a dorm at a university that's surrounded by forest and canyon. He was doing amazing with all the commands such as sit, wait, ready, watch me, stuff like that. 

Once we go outside, I began telling him how I should've put on his boots because of how cold it was(I could see his and my breath!). I then turned to look at him and that's when I saw his hackles begin to rise and he plants himself. He then let's out this deep and loud bark that took me by surprise. I stumbled back but immediately snapped out of it and pulled him behind the wall. 

The dorm I live in has this fenced garden area that's still open to the public. There's a gate to let in carts for maintenance workers that has a large gap underneath that my dog can get under really easily. I also want to emphasize that I technically live inside a canyon and inside the habitat of mountain lions and coyotes. 

Anyways, so I was able to move my pup behind the wall, but he's kinda frozen into this position. It looked like he was trying to make himself bigger. Every bark he made made the pit in my stomach heavier. I knew there was something there, and I had hoped it hadn't seen him. Animals here know how young look like, especially those coyotes. So I let him bark behind the wall hoping that whatever was there thought he was bigger. 

I was finally able to get my ID card and open the door. He was still barking and huffing but I took him back to my room immediately. I then left him in the room and told him I was going to check what was there.

We have three doors that lead to the outside, and one of them directly goes to that garden. I just went to look at the window and that's when I heard crunching of leave and twigs out there. My heart was racing and I almost had a heartattack when my door suddenly opened. My pup figured out how to open the door and he immediately sprinted towards me and got in-between me and door, barking and huffing. That's when the walking stopped though, so I immediately dragged my dog and myself back into the room. I was shaking violently because whatever was out there, it was dangerous. I had never seen him act like that and he has seen a coyote before. 

After calming himself down, he noticed I was shaking a lot, so he immediately started giving me kisses and hugs. He's my ESA, so he was heavily praised for this afterwards. Once I calmed down, he walked behind me and laid down between me and the door, huffing into the crack beneath the door. 

At the moment, I thought I was protecting him, but afterwards, I realized he was actually protecting me. It was scary as almighty hell, but he's a great pup. He'll be having a lot more treats from now on.

I travel for work and we’re staying in a motel, but I don’t use motel sheets. I use my own. I had just made the bed with clean sheets. I turned around to grab a pillow and when I turned back around he was on the bed already half done urinating, it was too late to stop him. I stripped the bed and threw a blanket on it and we slept ON a blanket for ten days and covered up with a comforter. Well, he didn’t urinate on the bed then. I work nights and it’s a stressful job and it’s a hard job. And I was tired when I got off for my four days. So, I finally got around to washing my sheets again. I put them on my bed, we slept on them last night and I left the room for about an hour this morning. When I got back he had urinated on the bed again. He does have a little bladder, so I make sure I walk him a lot. He is still intact. I wanted to wait until he was a year old. I heard there are several health benefits to waiting. I also have another male dog. There is a female dog in the building who’s in heat. I’ve thought about all of these things. I wanted to wait until we’re back home so we could go to his vet to get him neutered. But, I might have to do it where we’re at.I hate to have to put him out of the bed.

422,dogs,"Basically he keeps getting little scabs on his face. They are not from trauma or anything, we'll been watching well and I know what trauma/itching scabs look like. These are something else. It's almost like the type of scab one would get from irritation. About 75%  occur just above and between the eyebrows, and the rest other areas like the cheeks, once the chin. He will have about 2-3 at a time, and they are about the size of a corn kernel. They are not visible until they fall off and there is a little bit of fur missing, but one can feel them when feeling the fur on his face. When they eventually come off, that small area is left hairless for a couple weeks and then grows back. It's worth noting he also has some very different dry skin patches now very occasionally where the skin is flaky, the area is defined, and he has less fur in the areas, but they are not very noticeable and much more rare, and occur in areas like the butt and belly. He's only had a couple of latter in the past few months, and it's barely noticeable at any point unless you are looking. The former- well that a bigger concern.

We have already tried the vet, and they did the expensive culture thingy and found nothing with this unfortunately. We'll probably go in for the third time, but I'm stumped, and I don't blame them if they are. Sometimes it's like that, but other dog owners have experienced similar. It doesn't seem to hurt him but I'd like to prevent it. Also I can't help but feel bad for him when he has little tiny fur spots missing, poor little dude.

I do not see him really itch his face at all except his ears, like many dogs, BUT his adoptive sister, our other dog is OBSESSED with licking his face. The scabs have begun happening a noticeable amount only in the past 6 months or so, and since then we've been stopping her licking as much as possible just in case, but he WANTS her to sometimes and we have no idea if it's related, and previously we asked the vet and she said it shouldn't do harm (though this was before the weird scabs) so we try our best but  she still licks his face sometimes.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? At first we were sure it was just an allergy or something and would go away, but we're starting to realize it's not going to go away on it's own, and I am determined to make it stop.

423,dogs,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice. I have a three-year-old Shih Tzu Thor, who is generally very friendly, if a little nervous, around strange people. When we were out on a walk yesterday, we met a woman with a 13-month lab who was significantly bigger than Thor. As we were on a nature trail and we established both dogs were friendly, they both remained off the lead. 

They had the usual smells and played a little before the lab tried to hump Thor. He really didn't like this, so he ran over to me, where I put my hand down to keep the dog away, and we left. 

As the trail was a circle, we came across the lab and its owner again nearer the end. Thor was relatively far away to the right, and he doesn't tend to bother about other dogs, so I just continued. The lab ran over to him and started trying to hump him again. As Thor was quite far away, and I assume he didn't think he could safely get to me, he snarled and bit the air in a warning. I called him back, and he immediately started running back towards me. 

Unfortunately, the lab started chasing him, trying to hump him again. It was at this point thor turned around and began chasing and barking at the lab. 

I called him over, and he stopped chasing the lab and came to me, where I had to pick him up as the lab wouldn't listen to its owner.

I'm now concerned about the chasing and barking. Whilst I don't believe that situation was Thor's fault, he has never reacted like that before, making me nervous. 

Is this typical behaviour? Is there any extra training I should do? Should I stop letting him off lead, or do I need to muzzle him? 

It appeared that if I hadn't picked him up and the lab had kept going, he may have, bit it, so I'm really nervous about what to do next.

425,dogs,"Hi dog people 

I am seriously considering returning a rescue dog but feel so miserable and conflicted about it that I can't trust my thought process any more! She is two years old and I brought her home a week ago. She had been adopted previously and been with that family for six months but it didn't work out as she was too active for the original elderly dog in the home who had arthritis. They really loved her and wanted to make sure she went to a good home so we had several discussions prior. My original dog (adopted four years ago) is very healthy, active, and loves to play so I hoped they would have a good dynamic. 

New dog ticked a lot of boxes - gender, age, size, temperament. It wasn't on her profile, but I was told by her former owner that she is reactive towards passing cars on walks. I didn't consider this to be a problem as my original dog is dog reactive and I have done a lot of training with him, understand the process and challenges and am happy to work on it. With hindsight, this was extremely naive and quite arrogant. I fully underestimated the challenge of managing two reactive dogs alone. 

She is a beautiful dog but I feel completely overwhelmed by the amount of training she needs. We can barely make it down the street and her anxiety is rubbing off on my other dog which then makes me stressed. She also reacts to passing cars through the window (even with blinds down) inside at home which excites original dog and sets of barking. 

My plan is to work hard on positive training for the next two weeks and see if we can make any progress before I make a call. I want to tell myself that giving her up would be best for my original dog or best for new dog, but if I'm honest with myself I think it's coming down to the fact that I put in a lot of work to help my original rescue dog have the best possible quality of life and I'm realising that I lack the energy and motivation to do that again. Plus I'm very sensitive to any set backs to original dog's progress and confidence so seeing him react to new dog's anxiety is hard. Adopting a second dog was not a spontaneous decision, and I generally consider myself 'up for anything' when it comes to my fur babies so these feelings have really surprised me. 

This adoption group does not have a formal trial policy but I believe would take her back if needed. I would be happy for her to stay with me until another home is found. I'm still in touch with the first family who would also take her back if it doesn't work out, but this doesn't feel like a great outcome either. Through talking to them since, I've learned that they really struggled with the car issue too so she was rarely getting walked. 

I feel sick for even considering this. She's had so much instability in her short life already, and I hate that I might contribute to it. I know this could have been avoided if I'd asked more questions and better prepared for different scenarios. I'm not looking for people to make me feel better, just wondering if anyone's been in a similar 'second dog regret' boat and thought you were ready but totally weren't. How did you manage this? 

Advice for how to discuss this with the rescue group would be welcome too - I saw they already featured her in a 'happily adopted' post on their social media 😭💔 Thanks for reading!

427,dogs,"Hi all,

my Golden Retriever (6 years old, slightly overweight) has been limping for several weeks now. At the beginning, it was just a ""warming up"" issue, she would walk fine after the first couple of steps. I went to the vet, she looked at her spine, legs, touched everything but said there's nothing out of the ordinary. For now, she should just lose some weight. We're doing well in that regard, losing a good amount of weight, and we're weighing her at the vet as well.

Her condition hasn't improved and after putting some pressure on the vet, she got us an x-ray appointment after all... in January. The vet also mentioned that she felt like the affected leg has the knee feeling different, softer. She puts no pressure on the foot at all, only rarely. When she gets very excited (other dogs for example), she seemingly ignores it and runs around like there's nothing. 

When she tries to walk a little faster, she raises her right hind leg in the air completely. I reduced the amount we walk, but she seems to walk a lot farther with my father for example.

Her personality hasn't changed at all, she eats perfectly as well, even better than before we put her on a diet.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I'm just really scared it's cancer, and that there's nothing to be done. For now, is there anything else I can do to make sure she has some chance to heal? Walk less? Massages? Give her a shoe for the affected leg?

429,dogs,"Hello everyone! So I've decided that it's best for me to try and adopt an older puppy next end of spring. I'm not entirely sure how everything is gonna work out yet in regards to getting the pup from a shelter or looking out for an older pup from a breeder but for now I just wanted go do this just to see what everyone thinks would be a good dog for me just as a fun thing and added part to my research. :)

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

   * Yes this will be my first time.

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

   * I need a dog that would do good with my allergies. Likely would need a breeder but I know it's possible to find from a shelter too. I also am unsure if I have the ability to provide the care some shelter dogs that come with trauma require. 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

   * My ideal dog would be allergy friendly, loveable and intelligent. I would like a dog that I can teach easily and learn with. But I also really would love a dog that just loves to be around me and loves pets and cuddles.

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

   * Im interested in small breeds such as toy/mini poodles, maltese, yorkies (maybe they might be too rambunctious), and mixes of them (poodle mixes, maltipoo, ect). I like small dogs. I'm a small person myself so I don't think I could keep up with a big dog, and I also live somewhere with weight restrictions. But other than that I like how cute they are and their longer lifespans as I would really want to be with my dog to be with me for a long time. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

   * Basic things but also some tricks. I am interested in training my dog to remind me of taking medication (I saw someone mention that they taught their dog to do that). Mostly trying to get an emotional support dog (not an official one yet but I am seeing if I can qualify) but I think itd be fun to teach a lot of tricks and little convenient things.

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

   * No, my dog would mainly just be a companion. 

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

   * As long as I can. I still have school and will be out of the house occasionally so there is time that I would need apart but for the most part I am trying to get a work from home job to try to be around my dog as long as possible and will always devote time to walking and training and all that.

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

   * Im not sure. I have a changing schedule right now but ideally it will be stabilizing a bit. I will set a hard limit of a minimum of 30 minutes. As for exercise, walking and going outside would be an every day thing. I would also do play sessions. I am a bit wary of dog parks but I would definitely try them out.

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

   * As much as necessary. I've been looking into poodles for a while and understand that it's just a requirement for the breed to brush every day. And definitely I would like to learn to do grooming at home and would prefer it honestly. That way I can get a look that I like and also save some money. I'd go in for stuff I can't do though.

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

   * Small. Under 25 pounds (apartment limit) but ideally over 10 pounds. I am honestly a little terrified of the tiny 4 pound dogs. I'm worried I'd hurt them. The minimum isn't a hard limit tho its mostly just there because of my anxiety but I'd totally get a dog that's 7 pounds or something like that.

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

   * No shedding basically. The least the better (obviously there's no like complete 0 shedding, but for allergies it needs to be very very minimal). Barking wouldn't be ideal, I live in an apartment complex, no high rise or anything but still my neighbors would appreciate a dog that doesn't bark too much. As for slobber minimal would be best but it's fine I just wouldn't want a dog that's like constantly slobbery. 

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

   * It doesnt really matter. I need to do some research on that still but if I'm honest it would give me so much anxiety that I'd lose my dog or something would happen. If you can't tell I'm an anxious person. I would rather find a large fenced area. But I definitely want to have a good call command regardless because it's very important to me that my dog will come back to me if anything happens. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

   * Snuggly! I want a dog that I can snuggle with in bed and love pets and all that.

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

   * Would likely prefer eager to please, I just want a buddy.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

   * Ideally caution. Like generally would prefer to avoid having a dog that just barks at people and gets super angry and stressed with people around. But I don't also want my dog to run out the door to meet a stranger. I like friendly dogs tho so leaning on a friendly greet but with enough intuition to know if the person means harm. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

   * That would be so scary! Maybe when I'm more experienced but I'd super like to avoid that.

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

   * Um, this one's difficult cause id likeee to avoid separation anxiety and will work so hard to make sure it doesn't happen but I know it's so common in the breeds that I like but it will be an effort on my part to avoid it. Other than that aggression is something I'd like to avoid. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

   * My mom is almost always home. She works from home and doesn't go out much. So normally there will be someone in the house. As for me I go to university but would be getting a dog at a time where I wont have classes and when classes come back I would try to keep them to the same days as to not be out all the time. I'm going to switch to a work from home thing before I get the dog so that won't be a problem. The only time I'd be gone aside from school is when I'm at my partner's place which normally just 5 hours maybe 6 every other day to every couple days. 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

   * My mom doesn't want a male dog and would prefer a dog that isnt ""yappy"" but thats about it. My mom will take a secondary role in the dogs care. As it stands I will be the main carer and do all the training, grooming, ect but she might help to walk the dog to go potty if im not home and things like that. 

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

   * I have a gargoyle gecko but that's it. Might get cats eventually but this is so far into the future like more than 5 years cause my mom hates them so I'd have to move.

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

   * No

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

   * Yes we rent. The weight limit it 25 on our agreement but I think they changed it recently to allow bigger dogs. But to aire on the side of caution (and in case we move) I would say 25 pounds at the most. Breed restrictions are a lot of large breeds such as German Shepherds, Pit bulls, Staffordshire Terriers, Dalmatians, Akitas, and other breeds like that. Generally not any breed that would be a great match for me as I've described.

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

   * Not going to specify for safety reasons.

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

   * Summer: 90-100 F Winter: 60-70 F

434,dogs,"So I took my 2 year old Pomsky to get her distemper vaccine. This isn’t the first time she’s received it. 

Upon coming out of the clinic she puked. Great, seemed normal after receiving a vaccine. Vet didn’t say anything, she had also been eating milk bones. 

2-3 hours later she started puking profusely. Couldn’t hold water down, couldn’t eat. Low energy. So I took her back to the vet, they have her a shot of Cerenia. Great, she stopped vomiting, ate, and is keeping her food down.

Fast forward to now. I’m trying to get her to go to sleep. She won’t stop spinning around in circles trying to get comfortable, and I noticed her legs twitching or moving sporadically/involuntarily. See the videos below. 

She’s no longer vomiting, but the circling behavior and the sporadic/involuntary movements has me a bit nervous after reading this: 

Distemper also affects the nervous system, which can lead to twitching and involuntary movements known as myoclonus, facial seizures (“chewing gum seizures”), poor balance, head tilt, and circling behaviors.

She just laid down in this video, notice the movements. 

Also in the next video towards the end, you’ll notice she starts to kick. Right after that she started violently kicking so much that she almost threw herself up to sitting position.

442,dogs,"    I'm thinking about getting a second dog but don't know if it will help my current dog or make her anxiety worse. Sorry for all the text, I'm just writing down whatever I think is relevant since I really don't know what to do! 
    
    I have a small senior dog who is perfectly calm, very sweet and quiet as long as I'm around, but has pretty bad separation anxiety. She's been moved around a lot before I adopted her and, according to the rescue, her past 4 families in the last year all had multiple dogs. I've made some progress with training, she started off being anxious immediately after I leave, and now I can be out of sight for 10 minutes but she needs to be able to hear me. I can go somewhere else in the house for up to 10 mins, as long as I'm making a lot of noise (doing the dishes, vacuuming, etc.) but as soon as it gets quiet she starts barking and eventually peeing. Music and podcasts don't do anything for her, and if I leave and she can't hear me the anxiety starts immediately. I also need to always sleep AFTER she is fully asleep because if I turn off the lights, she can't see me and will get up to bark. I'm pretty sure it is separation anxiety and not isolation distress, she will get anxious even if I leave her with someone, just not as quickly. I'm working on training but we've been stuck at 10 mins for 3 months now and I'm starting to think she just won't be getting over it. 
    
    A few months after adopting this dog I visited family and brought her with me. They have a little dog too, a very boisterous yorkie. My dog entirely ignored the yorkie when he would try to play with her, so I didn't think she liked hanging out with other dogs. But I did notice her acting more independent and relaxed, such as finding a spot across the room to sit down by herself, when in the past she would always stand right next to me in case I moved anywhere. At some point she wandered off to another area of the house to look at something, which she's never done (she used to always keep me in sight). I thought that was strange but didn't think more about it- maybe it was just because of the new environment. 
    
    A few weeks later my friends came over and brought their dog, who is of the hyperactive extremely yappy kind, and she started acting more independent and confident again (but still totally ignoring this dog). Friends and I went outside for around 15 mins to see how she would behave with the dog while I was gone, and she was a little confused but didn't show her usual anxiety symptoms- I watched them through the dog cam the entire time. When we came back the other dog lost its mind while she just came up to us calmly. Her SA is usually the worst when she's at home, so I was surprised that she wasn't being anxious this time. 
    
    Now I'm confused about whether she actually likes the company of dogs or not. She is sensitive about her personal space with dogs and will bark or snap when they come close, she's never showed interest in playing with them, and always chooses to go up to people instead of dogs. I'd love to get her a companion if that will help with the anxiety, so I can eventually leave them at home while I eat out, go grocery shopping, just be able to go places without constantly having a dog with me. But because she's so needy of me I'm afraid introducing a new dog will trigger some jealousy and make things worse, and from those 2 experiences she seems to do well with very dominant energetic dogs which I don't know if I'll be up for. I'm fully prepared to foster a dog to see how she does, but will adding a second dog before her SA is resolved just make things worse?

I asked my manager who also fosters dogs with those kinds of issues if it was possibly a seizure. She said she's never dealt with that kind of issue before.

455,dogs,"A recent post describing one dog's behavior at the dog park, and this sub's general advice that that dog may not be suitable for dog parks (at least for now) got me thinking of my own dog. 

Johnnie is an 11-month-old intact male black Lab puppy. He is from a breeder and I have known the litter since they were 6 weeks old (this is relevant). 

I am not a big dog park user; we live on a ranch and Johnnie gets plenty of off-leash time at home, as well as play time with his big brother Harvey (12.5 year old  neutered male yellow lab). But I took Johnnie to town with me today, and after he was very good on several errands (even walked calmly on a loose leash right past a big mastiff puppy in the store - great work, Johnnie) I took him to a dog park in town on the way home. We had never been there - this was his second dog park visit ever.

I have always said that Johnnie ""fights from underneath"" - in play, he often lies down with his belly exposed, but he's still playing - it's not submissive. When he and Harvey play tug, he will throw himself pretty eagerly down to tug from another angle, only to pop up and tug on his feet, then roll around on the ground tugging upside down again. 

He did it at the park today, too. There were several other big dogs, all lower energy than Johnnie but very gracious and playful, tolerant of his higher energy. Johnnie was up-down-up-down the whole time, wagging the whole time, waving his paws in the air when he was down. 

Why does he play like this? I've never seen another dog spend so much time on their back in play. He is bouyant and confident.

He has *always* done this - I chose him out of the litter at 6 weeks because I watched him playing with his siblings in the same way and found it *hilarious,* I'm just curious.

This was the day my dog Lucky passed in the morning here in Colorado. I know it can be a false date.

He used to hate horses. When he’d see them his hair would stick up and he’d growl, even at the TV. He loved playing keep it up with a balloon.

1.	⁠Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..
2.	⁠Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*).  Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.
3.	⁠Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

My family previous had a lab/plot hound mix for about 11 years. We did regular/basic self-training. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Medium in size, low or no shedding, and a dog that would be easy to train to exercise with (I.e. running)

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Labs, German shorthaired pointer, German shepherd, etc. I like the idea of the dog making my girlfriend feel safe when she’s home alone, family friendly, and preferably low shedding (I know German shepherd shed quite a bit, but we’re looking into cross breeds as well)

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic house training but also to properly walk, some level of home/owner protection, a good exercise companion, and a good family dog. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, not looking to compete in any sport. The most I would like to be able to do it’s take my dog on a run with me. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

A few hours. I like to run and would love to take my dog with and when the weather is nice, I spend quite a bit of time outside. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2-3 hours. Again, I’d like to take my dog running and I have a large yard for exercise. Dog parks aren’t my favorite because I only know how my dog’s personality is, not others. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Willing to brush and do grooming at home, easy to do and helps the dog stay get more comfortable with his/her owners. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium size, something like a lab size. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Minimal shedding and slobber. Not against barking but just don’t want it to be constant. I do have neighbors with dogs so barking may come with the area. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I would like to be able to let me dog off leash in an unfenced area but only when it’s a safe opportunity to do so. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Somewhere in the middle is preferable. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I like to be able to let my dog out into my fenced in backyard to do their own thing. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I’d like to be able to train my dog to be introduced to people. So barking to knocks on the door or entering the yard isn’t something I mind. But if it’s a friend, I’d like to be able to train my dog to be introduced. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I’d prefer my dog not be aggressive towards other dogs. One that is generally friendly with most other dogs is preferable as I have family with dogs. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Overall I’d like my dog to have their own personality, friendly with friends and family but also somewhat of a guard dog as well. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

It really depends on my work schedule. I generally work shift work but my girlfriend may be able to take the dog to work with her occasionally. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

The main thing is a dog with low shedding, an exercise buddy, and dog that would help my girlfriend feel safe when I’m not home. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets, not planning on getting any others. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, but I do have nieces and nephews that visit from time to time as well as friends with kids. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I own a house, so this is not a problem. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I’m Southern NJ in the US. No restrictions in our area. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers are typically around mid-high 80s. Winters are around low-mid 30s. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.


My girlfriend and I are looking to get our first dog in our new home. We are looking for a dog breed with moderate-high energy and low shedding. My vet for our late family dog recommended the German Shorthaired Pointer as they require less professional grooming than most dogs and are great running partners that settle down easily.

471,dogs,"Hello, I have a question regarding a broken nail on my dog. So the other night, I noticed he was licking his paw a lot, and when I checked on him, his dew claw was partially broken. It wasn’t the whole nail, but maybe like half of it. I have no idea on how this happened. At that moment in time, I couldn’t bring him to the vet because it was 3am and there is no emergency vets near me.
The next morning when I checked on him, he had licked it once more and this time it fell off. I checked it out, it had a tiny amount of blood in it, but looked like it had stopped. I let time go on for a little and there was no blood anymore, and it looks fine to me. 
I read online that vets can’t really do much about a broken nail, aside from wrap it and put some powder on it to stop any potential bleeding. While the wrap would be a good idea, I know he would tear it off himself the second we get home. 
He does not appear to be in pain. He is panting a little bit, but it doesn’t seem out of the ordinary. He is still eating, drinking, playing, running around and barking, so his behavior is normal.

473,dogs,"Dog: 2.5 years old mixed (half Shiba half something) male

Background:
1. Relocated from China to Singapore and my dog is currently undergoing 30 day mandatory quarantine in a government facility.
2. Owners can visit daily for 2 hours, due to work I can really only go about 3 times a week
3. Since we adopted him when he was 3 months old, he hasn’t really been kept outside of our/ his home and separated from us outside of us leaving our home where he doesn’t have an issue so this is a new experience of being kept somewhere without us in a strange location at the same time

First visit: Visited him immediately after his arrival (hadn’t seen him in one month since he was staying with my wife in China and I relocated early for work), he was thrilled to see me and after the initial excitement began to furiously drink water, I expect he hadn’t drank much on his flight over, spent time with him and was happy, however when I left and had to leave him there he was crying like I’ve never heard him before.

Second visit: Visited 2 days after the first , happy to see me again but made very abnormal sounding cries I haven’t heard before like he was saying please take me away and then drinking lots of water again, as the end of the two hours was approaching he was anxious and you could tell he was worried I was going to leave and when I did you could tell he felt awful crying jumping up against the door etc, makes me feel awful too as I wish there was more I could do for him 

Unfortunately he is only about 4 days in and has 26 to go with little chance I can get him out early so this will continue for a period of time and I am worried if he is going to come out different and scared for good, wondering if Reddit has any advice on what I can do to keep him mentally healthy in there so he comes out a loving dog with his same personality.

Currently on my visits I:
- Feed him snacks after my arrival / when I leave in a sniffing mat so he has to work for it (not interested as he is crying about me leaving)
- Try to play with him in the quarantine room (not really interested)
- Try to play with him in the 15 minutes we are allowed in an outside area (not interested just stand in the corner like he wants to leave), doesn’t go to the bathroom either
- Snuggle with and hug him give him some small snacks throughout

None of this seems to work to get him to be relaxed when I leave, or make him happy as your can tell he is super anxious, so really appreciate any help and advice people can offer on activities on how to keep him mentally healthy and make it easier on him when I leave so he can get through this torturous month.

474,dogs,"I decided to try Trupanion when I adopted a 13 year old.  I knew they wouldn't cover her existing conditions.  However, when she developed Cushing's, that was a new condition.  They denied coverage because she had had a slightly elevated lab level in the blood work done before her dental procedure shortly after I got her.  There was no diagnosis of Cushing's at the time and the level was not even elevated enough for the vet to even mention it to me.  I sent them a letter explaining this and they did not bother to respond. Nevertheless, I decided to give them another try when I adopted another senior.  She now has a mass in her ear which could be cancer.  Trupanion is denying coverage because when I adopted her she had alopecia on her ears, ear discharge, and a possible ear infection.  Obviously not the same thing as a mass that could be cancer.  An ear infection is treatable with antibiotics.  Moreover, the vet looked at her ears then due to the ear infection and did not see or report any mass in her ear.

Sleeps in his crate amazingly (it only took two days for him to get used to it). Rarely has accidents despite no house training when I got him. Walks pretty great on a leash. Loves cuddles. Is great with cats.


But I feel nothing for him. Just annoyance and anxiety. I thought I wanted a dog but now I don't think so. I don't show this to him at all. I take him on 2-3 walks a day, we play fetch, I let him cuddle me. I could keep him forever and I think he would be happy but I know I'd be miserable.

I take her on 2 walks a day and we have a giant backyard that is fenced in that she roams around all day while I’m at work. Cut to my roommate- he got his dog as a puppy during Covid and it’s a little over 2 now. Since he has owned this dog he has barely given it any attention. As soon as he comes home from work he pets the dog and says hi then goes into his room and shuts his door for the rest of the night. He’ll come out to feed it dinner but that’s it.

So at home we have 4 year old male cane corso. Out of the many attacks i have suffered today was the most scary one. Sometimes when member of the family is coming home he doesn't likes that and he'll come and attack my feet ,no bites before today.
 Today my dad and brother came home and i walked up to greet them when the dog suddenly snaps and attacks me , first my feet then he starts jumping on me and trying to bite me on my hands and body, i was lucky i had sweater on ,but the moment i turn around to get in the room he bit my ass. Now im left with puncture wound on the ass and marks of bites all over my hands, my whole body is bruised from his jumps.
 I was so scared i cried and cried ,my heart is broken. Out of all the family members i care for him most  . We greet each other every day when i come home from wrok,he seems so happy to see me, but he keeps attacking the whole family, just not my mom because she feeds him and one time she beat him really hard because he attacked my little brother just because he was sitting on the couch and the dog wanted to sit there.
He'll attack for anything he doesn't like especially me ,but im so tired mentally and from now on I'll be scared for my life too.
Nobody wants to train our dog because he bit his last trainor, leaving him with deep puncture wounds.
I tired to train him and always approached him with love but he'll try anything not to obey me even trying to bite me.  I just can't count the times he attacked me,or any dog or human on the street. I honestly don't think life with a dog should be that hard, he tries so hard to dominate everyone he sees, I don't think he's scared at all.

483,dogs,"We have a Pitsky Collie (Husky + Pittbull + Border Collie) and he loves to be outside. It’s getting colder, and he still wants to play outside longer than seems bearable. He likes the snow, or at least has no problem with it. 
My question is this: what’s too cold for a husky-mix? I’ve seen so many videos and posts about huskies not wanting to come inside and being able to handle very cold weather, but since he’s a mix I’m worried.
For context, his coat is short, and though it does seem to be a double-coat when I brush him, it’s not fluffy like a typical husky’s. He’s had no problems with his paw pads or ears so far. His underbelly is bare. 
I got him a little sweater, but I also don’t want to overheat him if it’s not needed. Does he need boots if he’s just in the yard? How long can he be out at what temperatures? What can I do to make outside more accommodating, besides just an insulated dog house (they free roam from inside to outside, but a dog house seems good if he decides to not wanna come in). 
We have three other dogs, all different breeds so different needs. Our elderly Cocker spends the most time inside, as his hair is very thin and, of course, the age. 
Our Pomeranian has more free-will as his coat is EXTREMELY fluffy and insulated. 
My Rottweiler does well in the cold, but let’s me know when he’s had enough- unlike the mix we’re discussing.

Its only his head that’s shaking, the rest of his body seems fine. He doesn’t tense up but seems to notice the shakes but isn’t perturbed by them.

Sometimes I can break him out of it by rubbing his head, or getting him to get up and move around.

He’s been on flea and tick medicine for two months now, his last dose was 11/22/22; and it’s Simparica. I understand sometimes that can cause shaking or seizures. But I don’t understand why it wouldn’t cause tremors or IHST sooner? That dose was more than two weeks ago.

The only other thing I can think of that may be an external cause is that he likes to go and hunt mice and lizards around our central air unit in the backyard, and likes to lay around it. Can something in the unit be harming him?

496,dogs,"Had 3 dogs, alpha died and now the shy one is bullying the other one nonstop. 

I had Two mini poodles (Chips and Twix) who are litter mates for 14 years and a mixed terrier (Daryl) for 13 years. 

Twix and Daryl used to be best buddies. And Chips got along with both and was the Alpha. They all pretty much got along great. 

About 2 years ago the dynamic began to change. We built an addition to the house, added a doggy area about 3x5 ft with a doggy door and Twix became territorial over the doggy door. He often blocked Daryl from entering and once in the doggy area they would sometimes fight. But Chips would defend Daryl and Twix would back down. Twix respected him a lot. Chips and Daryl became closer. 

Chips passed away in January. Twixi had become increasingly aggressive towards Daryl so he doesn’t use the doggy door anymore. They fight almost every time they are in the doggy area. Now it’s increased to where Twix attacks Daryl when they are outside. 

They used to spend hours in the doggy area with no problem while we were at work and even when it became a problem, putting them in backyard was always fine since they love it back there. 

I think Twix is trying to be an alpha but he’s always been a shy and timid dog so it’s not in his nature. 

He only does it when we are not there so we hear them fighting and have to come break them up. 

Luckily he is a little poodle and does no physical damage but my poor Daryl gets scared. 

We work from home now so we are able to interfere each time and even avoid putting Daryl in those situations for the most part. But it’s getting worse.

499,dogs,"I currently have a 3.5 year old wirehaired pointing griffon. She is an awesome adventure buddy and has a great temperament - friendly and submissive with other dogs and super friendly with people. I also have a 16 year old cat who is very social with people and healthy/active for her age. My dog and cat tolerate each other and the cat has her own room that is gated off with a baby gate.

500,dogs,"Hi all. (also posted to r/dog advice) sorry for the very long post, TLDR at bottom. i just want to preface this by saying that I know none of this is necessarily my dogs FAULT, as she is just a dog and I understand she’s in a stressful situation at the moment. I don’t mean to make the title sound like I resent her or blame her per say, but that is just how I have been feeling. 

Dog info: Rose. about 3yrs old, rescued 2 years ago by my boyfriend after she was found tied up in a hallway (abandoned) and pregnant. She is an american pitbull terrier with some husky in her, and she is an incredibly happy and gentle dog. She does not bite, she is not aggressive, she is good with kids and other dogs. she is up on all her shots etc and has no health issues. her diet is regular and healthy. Although she is my boyfriends dog I have spent a lot of time with her and we are very familiar with each other. 

Now that all of that is out of the way: here’s the issue. 
Rose has lived in my boyfriends house since he adopted her , so for about two years now. a couple of months ago he and I moved into a new apartment together. The apartment is only a couple of minutes from his parents house where he had been previously living, so we decided to leave Rose there for the first couple of weeks while we painted and moved in and just to not rush things while we figured out the situation. the plan was always to have her move in with us obviously, but his parents were willing to help and since she has some trauma we wanted to keep her anxiety and stress as low as possible. At first we started by just bringing her over for one or two day periods and letting her feel out the space and establish comfort areas like her bed and certain spots on the rug etc. we just finished moving everything in and painting and getting some work done in the place so a couple of days ago we decided it was time to bring her here , as she is familiar with the space by now and we missed her. all her things are her and we have not changed her schedule in terms of eating and going for walks and sleeping. 

rose has separation anxiety from my boyfriend/people in general. she’s totally fine when i’m here with her and he’s at work (I work from home so I luckily am able to spend my day with her) but if she’s alone she has a track record of barking. it stopped some time after her adoption, but we knew we may run into that issue here in a new space with new sounds of other people since it’s an apartment not a house. for the first three days I did not leave the house once. I didn’t go to the gym in the morning like I usually do, I didn’t go grocery shopping, I haven’t done laundry. on day four I got fed up and decided the only way to get her used to me/boyfriend coming and going was to leave and come back to show her that it was ok. i know it sounds like i’m being dramatic since it’s only been a few days of being inside, but it’s quite dark and gloomy where we are and I find that I get really down and out when I can’t leave a space to get some fresh air and walk around/can’t engage in my normal routine and health activities. 

so I prepared all her things the night before and set my alarm for 8am. day five (today) I woke up in the morning, took rose out, brought her in and gave her a bone with peanut butter in it (her favorite), turned the tv on Dog Tv for her, said goodbye (didn’t make a huge deal about it but still acknowledged that i would return) and left. I set up my laptop camera before I left so I could see if she peed or barked when I left/for how long it went on. I live five minutes from the gym, so I knew I wouldn’t be gone long. I was at the gym for 20 minutes and I started to get stressed thinking that she could be freaking out and we could potentially have the police called on us (happened at boyfriends house once) so I left. I stopped at the local grocery store for another 20 mins and headed home. 
according to my camera I was gone for one hour and 5 minutes (including driving, going to gym, groceries, checking out, driving home, unloading the groceries and bringing them in. so I was probably actually off the property for maybe 45 mins). when I came in I didn’t hear anything and was excited, but to my dismay the moment I opened my door the smell hit me. she guiltily approached me and I saw that she had defecated all over the floors. I admittedly got angry and yelled at her which i should not have done, and I walked her over to the poop so she could smell it (I saw someone do this with their dog and thought this was what was supposed to happen) and then put her out on the balcony with her toy and food while I cleaned it up so she could watch me clean without trying to eat it or anything. 

I then had a look at the camera footage. about five minutes after I left she began barking. and then screaming. when I say screaming, I mean screaming. an awful, indescribable howling screaming sound that continued for the entire time I was gone. I let her back in and fed her and apologized for yelling (guilty conscious) and that was that. 
after that, I went to shower. in the ten minutes I was gone she peed on the couch. I was floored. she cannot be left alone for a moment without doing something like this. I am afraid to even step foot outside. we walk her at least four times a day so I know it’s not that we aren’t walking her enough or anything. I understand that it has to be an anxiety thing, but I can’t be a slave to this dog, but I also don’t want to ask my boyfriend to bring her back to the house and not have her live with us. I am thinking about trying charlottes web anti anxiety treats as recommended by a coworker, or even getting her a script for anti anxiety meds. training is very expensive, and I don’t know how long we can clean up urine and poop off the floors and couches waiting for her to learn. we love her, but I don’t know what to do. we are willing to pay for the training but is this something training would even help with? any advice?

TLDR: my dog with anxiety just got moved into our new apartment and won’t stop urinating, screaming, and pooping in the apartment any time she is left alone for more than a minute. what can we do that will help that doesn’t cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars? we are willing to pay for training, but is this the type of thing for a trainer to handle?",t2_mjwp4hk,0,my dogs behavior has made me feel like a prisoner in my own home. advice?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zfen1k,True,amorgan1013,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zfen1k/my_dogs_behavior_has_made_me_feel_like_a_prisoner/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zfen1k/my_dogs_behavior_has_made_me_feel_like_a_prisoner/,2468001,1670448832,0,,False,1670448845,1670448846,2022-12-07 21:33:52,,,,,

506,dogs,"**TL;DR - My current consensus:**  
Enjoy whatever exercise you and your puppy would like and are ready for with some common sense and restraint where appropriate. A year is a large part of a dog's life and exercise is important for their physical and mental health as well as your bonding. Don't completely avoid activities for an entire year just because there may be a slightly higher chance of issues later in their life - they may very well have bigger health issues if and when the joint issues come into play.

**Why is it hard to find reasonable, trustworthy information about this?**  
Does anybody have links to recent studies on this that have data (like % differences instead of just ""more likely"") as well as a breakdown of the effects of puppy exercise on joint health so I don't have to analyze it myself? I don't want to read a thesis, but it would be interesting to read about how controlled the groups are and how much of a difference was observed. Most studies I've seen are comparing very light puppy exercise to extreme amounts of exercise, not moderate exercise that the majority of puppies would engage in.

**Between some quick internet searches and common sense, here's my thoughts in more detail:**

1. Dogs (and people) need exercise. Exercise has many benefits that aren't a consideration for studies about the impact of exercise on joint health. A wholistic view is important for health and quality of life.
2. The intent behind any dog's activity should be for the health and enjoyment of both dog and owner. Excessive exercise just to avoid the dog ""bothering"" the owner is selfish and wrong.
3. Rules like ""5 minutes of exercise per month of age"" are completely made-up nonsense. Every dog is different and every owner may need to adapt to their dog's needs throughout their lives together. This will mean less exercise when they are younger, but because of their physical development, not their joints. Likewise, dogs must adapt to their owner's lifestyle.
4. Genetics are a significantly bigger factor for joint issues than the amount and type of exercise as a puppy. How much I don't know - would love to learn more if there's meaningful information out there.
5. Dogs are animals that are descendants of wolves. To suggest that puppies should not run for exercise seems like a ridiculous notion. That being said, we live in an age where most running is on concrete. My take is that moderate walks are perfectly fine, but running should be limited (whether playing fetch or just running). 1-mile runs a few times per week is probably fine around 6 months. 2-mile runs around 8 months. Frisbee and other jumping exercise should probably wait until 10+ months.",t2_p4ah9,0,Puppy Exercise and Long-Term Joint Health,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Health]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Health],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9206ce6-d8fc-11ec-ab40-4af549fcc743,True,False,True,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0079d3,zfdsc7,True,EE_technology,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zfdsc7/puppy_exercise_and_longterm_joint_health/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zfdsc7/puppy_exercise_and_longterm_joint_health/,2467997,1670447078,0,,False,1670447093,1670447093,2022-12-07 21:04:38,,,,,
507,dogs,"Three months into crate training a GSP puppy. He is just over six months now. Evening routine is solid. Goes into crate happily in our room. Sleeps till 6:30am. Drag him out to pee. Then start day. But during the day it's a whole other game. If the crate is in the dinning room in center of house, he can nap for an hour or maybe two. But that's the max. We are trying to move him back into bedroom so it's not so disturbing with foot traffic and street noise while in kitchen.

509,dogs,"Our almost adult (F, 11mo) vizsla puppy has been on and off having GI issues for pretty much all of her life. Even as a puppy she often had soft stools and diarrhea but were told this is common in puppies. 

She is also generally not very food motivated and incredibly picky, when she was younger she sometimes just didn't eat but would resume soon enough (ie didn't eat lunch but ate breakfast and dinner etc) 

We took her to the vet at cca 6 months old for a specific gastro issue (as she was not eating for over 24h + vomiting) They did a bunch of tests, came back as an infection and she got antibiotics which helped her for a while but then the same thing pretty much happened twice or thrice over the course of three months.

 In Sept. they decided to do a giardia test which came back positive and it seems like they successfully got rid of it (She also got tested for a bunch of organ specific issues all of which came back negative and the vet has commented on multiple occasions throughout checkups and apts that her organs are doing great.) 

The giardia treatment seemed to have helped for at least a while as her poops finally became ""correct"" and she was eating enthusiastically. 
Then we had to take her to the vet again for an allergic reaction where her entire face got swollen. 
(result of that also came back as definitely allergies but we didn't find out what as the tests required to do that are apparently only available to do once the dog is at least 1yo + they are insanely expensive)

She was eating just fine with the allergic reaction and still pooping normally but we couldn't figure out what she could've had a reaction to that wasn't food as its winter here and nature and insects are long gone. 

One week ago she has once again developed vomiting very similar to the first time we had to take her, except she was still eating excitedly and was constipated this time instead of diarrhea. They did a bunch of x rays (thought it could've been a blockage) which showed gas in her intestines and a blood test showed she was experiencing a slight infection. The vet also did an ultrasound on her stomach and pointed out that all of her organs seem healthy except for the gas.

We did more x rays over the next two days to completely rule out an obstruction, most of the gassiness seemed to have disappeared and she was cleared as she was no longer showing any symptoms she came with. 

The vet has suggested we switch her food again as she wasn't very happy with some ingredients on the one we had her on. (mind you this has also been somewhat of a pattern with her, where we give her a certain kind of food, she enjoys it for a while and everything is fine and then suddenly develops issues again or just stops liking said food and we have to switch to a diff. one.) the one she had now was probably the longest we lasted with one food brand... 

based on the vet's suggestions we switched her food again (gradually) 

Everything was ok for like 3 days and now she is not eating again. Yesterday she was still eating her wet food just none of the kibble and even had some yogurt and a carrot. 

Today i managed to force her to eat breakfast but for dinner she is not even coming near the bowl despite me putting in more wet food incase she just dislikes the new kibble. 

Another note - we've tried feeding her all kinds of kibble, more expensive, less expensive, for sensitive dogs, hypoallergenic, hollistic, foreign brands etc. 
but despite us being able to eliminate some that gave her diarrhea we pretty much get the same results every time. 

I am just wondering how come is our dog this food sensitive yet seems completely healthy otherwise and each time she is sick it seems to be a different cause. Is this just a series of poor coincidences or is there something we/the vets aren't considering? 
Could this just be due to food allergies? 
I know some of her earlier bouts of sickness could probably have been caused by giardia flaring up or just weakening her immune system. But she has long been testing negative for giardia and the gastro issues are still present :/

513,dogs,"I know I’ll be getting shit for this, so.. let me have it. 

I have two dogs, a 5 year old lab rescue and a 2 year old duck Toller rescue.  At the time of rescue we were living in a house with a big yard and then a breakup happened and I was forced to move into an apartment. 

My lab is a total sweetheart and totally trainable and does great on the leash, off leash and has 10+ and growing tricks she can do. 

The Toller is who I am having massive issues with. From him lunging and barking at guests for no reason (or regularity), to being an absolute monster on the leash trying to hunt for lizards at every tree we pass. It’s very frustrating and potential liability if he were to ever bite someone. I

The lunging and barking part is new to the apartment, prior he would just bark and go hide from the new person. He recently snapped at an old man we’ve seen 100 times on a walk while he was trying to give them a treat (also have done this 100 times). I recently had a friend stay with me and ended up having to board my dog while she was here because we were all afraid that he was going to bite her. 

I’ve spent the money on training, he’s not food motivated and I refuse to e-collar my dogs unless we are on a full bore off-leash adventure (hasn’t happened since I got the Toller). I feel like I just simply don’t have it in me to help get him where he needs to be. 

I find myself extremely frustrated with him and don’t have the energy to put up with it for much longer. 

I know he’s a good boy and I am not a new dog owner, but I just feel like he could be happier elsewhere.

516,dogs,"Hello Reddit!

I guess the title sums it up. I (19f) have been around dogs all my life, however, I have never had a dog to call my own (my parents did not want any). I guess the only real experience I have is I regularly volunteer at animal shelters, however, I am basically starting for square one.

I am in college and will not be even trying to find a foster until I get an apartment next year (my future roommate is ok with this and I have already made sure with the apartment). Of course I understand how much of a responsibility this is and I am very much looking forward to spending most of my free time with the foster pup.

Hopefully by starting many months out I can learn as much as possible to get as prepared as I can be. I know this might sound weird but I am also hoping to get in better shape so that I can take the dog on walks and play with them as much as possible! Also I do know that since this will be the first dog I ever take care of that I will need to start small and not take on too much.

Does anyone here have any recommendations for online classes, apps or other things I can do to help prepare me for getting a foster pup? Not only do I want to create a loving space for the dog, but I want to help them in any way possible with whatever they may need physically and emotionally. My aunt will also be helping me (she has had many fosters before) but I want to do the most to prepare so I thought reddit might help.

He absolutely loves it and he plays so great with other dogs. The only thing is is that his playing style is a little rough. He uses his body and paws, and loves to chase and be chased. Most of the dogs and owners there are just fine with it except for one woman. 

We’ve seen her there a few times and my dog is never too rough with hers, but he really tries to get her dog to play - running back and forth in front of it trying to get it to chase him. Almost every time my dog starts playing with hers she asks me to “get my dog off of hers” because he’s “getting too aggressive” with hers.

521,dogs,"Hi - Creating this post as a record of what we are going through in the hopes of helping other people prevent and treat a spinal injury in their beloved dog! There are a few things that I wish I had known before we had to go through this painful experience. I will try to update!

THE INJURY

On Monday, 11/28/22 at 1 AM, our dog jumped up into our bed. In the moment of the jump, he screamed terribly, peed, and his anal glands expressed. He laid on the bed screaming, we couldn't touch him or calm him down. We had no idea what happened. I now know that this was a disc in his back rupturing - and others have told me the experience is similar. If this happens, take your dog to an ER. Do not let him jump in or out of the car, carry him. Insist on an MRI! We went to an animal ER, but we were sent home. We were told he had hurt his back and to keep him on some pain meds. They did not recommend an MRI even though I specifically asked if he could have slipped a disc.

By 8 AM the next morning, our dog was paralyzed waist down (stage 4 non-ambulatory, still had DPS deep pain sensation). 

SURGERY

We rushed him to a different animal ER (FYI, if you are in the NYC area, Schwarzman Animal Medical Center is THE place to go for something very very serious.) They are the only Level 1 animal trauma center in NYC. They have the staff and the tools you will need so that your pet can be treated there. AMC gave told us they suspected a slipped disc due to IVDD. We got an MRI and he had emergency spinal surgery. They saved his life. After the surgery, he still had DPS which all drs told us was the best indicator of him regaining the ability to move his legs.

By Thursday, we got him home. We had to manually express his bladder until Sunday as he was paralyzed waist-down. He had zero movement. We moved him with a sling. He shook and trembled all night (I was told NOT to worry about this, could be stress, being home, pain meds).

RECOVERY

Our vet told me not to worry about the sutures. They will be fine. Meds are important but don't be overwhelmed. Most important and hardest thing will be manual bladder expression.  (NOTE: His anti-anxiety meds seemed to do the opposite, he shock terribly on them, so we discontinued those.)

Recovery has been slow. By Saturday we saw a little tail strength (something there pushing back when we moved it). His tail shot out when he pooped. His back legs began stiffening slightly during sleep. 

By Sunday, I could not express his bladder. I was in a panic, if they don't pee for over 16 hours it is a medical emergency. But I felt some muscles pushing against me when I pressed. I took him outside and realized: he had been holding it in. He had regained the ability to hold his bladder, which is a HUGE good sign. 

Now it is Wednesday. He is putting a tiny bit of weight on his legs when we place his feet under him. He has begun moving his legs when walking. He puts weight on them in short bursts. We are extremely optimistic for a full recovery with time.

Everyone says dogs recover at their own pace and I could not find timelines online, which is why I wanted to give ours. Our dog is a big-ish guy (53 lbs) boxer mix. I was told big dogs take longer to recover. He had DPS before and after surgery and we were told his spinal cord went back 'into shape' after surgery to remove the ruptured disc plus 2 others that had been affected by the discharge. He had reflexes after surgery, and his butthole clenched up. He peed tiny amounts by himself 1-2 seconds. These are all excellent indicators of recovery.

4 days post surgery the first small movement began. Tiny tail strength, twitch. Sunday a full tail wag! Monday some leg movement on walking with sling. Tuesday he tried to scratch his face w/ back paw but couldn't reach. Began being able to move from one side to the other. Today is about the same as yesterday. 

WHAT IS IVDD?

Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is a degenerative disease that can affect your dog's spinal cord and causes a range of mobility issues. It is, basically, the weakening of the walls of the spinal discs that contain the fluid, making them susceptible to rupture. It is not terribly uncommon, and the ER doctor told us she sees it often in pit bulls (our dog is 30% pit) and it is also common in dachshunds. 

WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP MY DOG MAINTAIN SPINAL HEALTH?

Once our dog can walk again, we will need to make major life changes so that this doesn't happen to him again. However, I would also recommend that every dog owner do the following. You never know if your dog could have this condition. 1) No jumping in and out of the car. 2) No jumping on and off furniture (my future pets will not be allowed on couches). 3) No jumping on and off the bed. 4) Minimize stairs. For example, your dog might not be allowed on the upper floors of your house. If you cannot avoid stairs, dogs should take them at a slow walk, never a run where they are flying up and down or leaping down the last few steps. **I really, really wish I had known these things before this happened.**

I hope this helps someone in our position. We are routing for you (please route for us and our guy, too!)

522,dogs,"Both of my vets have been offering online ordering through a Covetrus portal on their own websites. I had checked the food and prescription prices with Covetrus a few times and didn't find them competitive, but recently decided to order my cat's prescription food that way. I didn't want to hassle with a delay to get the prescription authorized through the Chewy site and the price was the same.

First, I discovered that the ""free shipping"" only applies to automatic shipments. Otherwise it's $15.99 for a case of cat food. What? Okay, so I'll sign up for autoship and cancel later if necessary.

I placed the order late Thursday night last week. Today I was wondering if the shipment would be here in the next couple days because I'm getting low on food. Low and behold, an email from Covetrus today. Yay!

But actually, BOO! Because it was an email saying the shipment had literally just gone out today and that it would be another 3-5 *business* days before arrival. So that's possibly two weeks from my order date to arrival here. It's very deceptive that they say ""delivery in 3-5 days"" on their site but fail to mention the lag time in getting the shipment ready to go out. Apparently they have to send the order to the manufacturer and then have the manufacturer ship it.

This would be good to know before ordering food.

526,dogs,"Hey guys. Not sure if this belongs here, but I'll cross post to a couple of other spots in case not.

I adopted a 1.5 year old mix ( was told mostly ACD) named Bella approx. 4-5 months ago. I absolutely love her but we've definitely had our share of issues we've been working on with a trainer. Said trainer went MIA, hence my last resort being posting to reddit with these new issues arising.

The last few months I've found that Bella had been stopping randomly on our walks/hikes and refusing to go any further. I'm not an expert in dog body language (Bella is my first dog) but it appears she is scared when she stops as her tail is tucked and she seems to have a fearful look in her eyes. I have attempted to coach her to continue on our walks/hikes when she does this with treats/scratches but she absolutely refuses. She will sit without me telling her to, or attempting to run/pull away to the point she's almost stood on her hind legs a few times.

I honestly don't know what to do here. I'm a pretty avid hiker and was beyond happy to find my furry adventure buddy when I adopted her. (It was honestly love at first sight.) It's incredibly disappointing to drive a couple of hours to a hike only to have Bella stop so far in and refuse to go any further. When she does this I have to reluctantly turn around and I come home in tears and even more stressed.

TBH I feel incredibly guilty for even posting this. I try and be as patient as I can when this happens but I can't help but feel incredibly frustrated when she does this. I'm willing to work through whatever this is with her, I just have no idea where to start.

I had her to the vet only a few months ago for her annual/needles and she got a clean bill of health. So I don't think its that she is in pain/or a medical issue. I also don't think its because she is tired as she has an immense amount of energy and previously we would go for hikes much longer with no issues.

We went in to get him and he wasn’t the breed we originally thought we were getting (I know, we’ve learned a lesson here.) We found out he wasn’t the original breed we were promised after we had him home and started the initial puppy training via dna test. The breeds he actually was was not something we would have originally sought out. Sporty, high energy, double coated and not at all what we signed up for but there was no way we could get rid of him once we found out. We had already fallen in love with him and wanted to give him a true chance. We spent thousands of dollars on board and train, e collar training etc in the two years following. The training helped a little but he was still kind of unpredictable with energy levels and controlling his nerves was, well, it was hard. I have three kids. He does wonderfully with them. Very affectionate and never once aggressive. Well, until the incident. 

There was an incident three days ago. We recently moved from a big yard situation with a wooden fence. We now have a chain linked fence in close proximity with other homes and kids everywhere. One of the neighborhood kids stuck his hand under my fence and my dog bit his hand, drew blood, sent him to urgent care. I wasn’t outside when it happened. I had the dog secure in the fence of course but still, a bite happened. We understand that dogs are territorial but that incident spoke to us in a way that told us he is anxious, nervous, ultimately unhappy. 

We tried. So hard. Spent so much money. But he’s not doing well. He’s not thriving with us. And the bite, no matter the circumstances, changes things. 

We rehomed him to a Rescue particular to his breed. But we are so, so sad. Heart broken, actually. The love we have for him is immense but we truly felt like he wasn’t getting the best life with us. 

I guess I’m looking for advice. Thoughts. Anything to help.

For a little context she’s a miniature long hair dachshund. She’s 11 months old and about 6-8 weeks ago she was in heat for the first time. She started crying and whimpering with this certain toy a couple days ago and I thought nothing of it because I just thought she wanted to play like usual so I threw it around with her like nothing was wrong. Yesterday at lunch I went home like always to let her out to use the bathroom and she would not stop crying and whimpering with this toy in her month and laying on it in her bed and nesting with her bed as well. So we thought something was seriously wrong with her. She was eating fine and using the bathroom fine so we thought she must of gotten hurt or something while we weren’t home. So my girlfriend called the vet and they said bring her in right away it could be a back injury because of the breed they are prone to it, So we took her in and they said everything was fine with her body it’s just hormone wise with this false pregnancy situation. She’s super aggressive towards everything right now because she thinks she’s a mother with this toy and will not stop crying and whimpering for it. If I take it away she just goes crazy and cries even more and will continue to cry until I give it back and runs to her bed to protect it. So idk if I should just take it away for good or is that to cruel? The Vet didn’t really give us any solutions to help with the problem so I was wondering if anyone has any home remedies they could share or tips to deal with her and make her feel okay would be lovely.

538,dogs,"Hi All,

I recently relocated from a house with around 7 acres of land, a back yard and one older dog, to a 1 bedroom apartment in the city due to a job change.  I have a 9 month old puppy who has spent her whole life at the house, but recently relocated with me into the apartment.  After about a week of living in the apartment, she seems to be a shell of her former self.  

She is no longer interested in playing and has gone from dropping toys in my lap, to wandering from room to room to lay down in different spots.  She seems to be constantly on edge, alerting at any and all “normal” apartment sounds.  She has also been having a hard time using the bathroom around the apartment with all the new city sounds in the area, and when she does go it is usually mucousy diarrhea.  

Thankfully, shes still eating and drinking normally, although she seems to have lost interest in some of her favorite treats.  Walks have also been tough since she seems to afraid of some of her new surroundings. 

I work from home most days but need to be able to go into work at a moments notice.  Is this behavior something that will get better by itself with a little time and effort?  Is there anything I can do to ease this transition for her?

542,dogs,"I’m new to this area. My neighbors have a couple of French bulldogs. They were really loud and annoying when we first moved in, but I know that’s how dogs can be so no worries.

Well we have noticed over the past few months that they don’t just have a couple- they have FIVE French bulldogs. And they are always outside, no exception. They don’t have grass in their backyard, only concrete. So they poop on the concrete, we can see it piling up out there and the dogs run through it to come jump at the gate and bark at people walking by, or at us when we throw our trash out. It also seems like maybe they don’t get fed regularly, but that’s just an assumption because typically in the morning we can hear the dogs dragging their metal bowl all over the concrete, it’s really loud and lasts for hours sometimes. I believe they do this when they’re hungry to get their owners attention until they get fed. Again, I am guessing because I don’t sit and watch or snoop, so I don’t know that for sure.

I feel bad for them and I believe they are being neglected. Not abused, I’ve never seen or heard them abusing the dogs but I do hear the dogs fight with each other until one starts yelping and crying. They’re more than likely bored out of their minds.

I’m not sure if there is anything that can be done, especially since they aren’t being abused.

548,dogs,"Hi there! I'm hoping someone can help me because I'm at my wits end with my 6 year old GSD/Treeing Walker Coonhound mix. A little backstory: I got him when he was a month old and he has been with me ever since. When I first got him I worked at a dog daycare place and he came to work with me everyday so I had zero issues exercising him. The first couple years he was training to be my service dog and he came EVERYWHERE with me so he always had a job and plenty of exercise. I have a chronic illness and I only have so much energy to expend during the day before I crash and am at risk for becoming fatigued to the point of being bedridden. I don't use him as a service dog anymore because there isn't anything he can do out in public that is a real benefit to my fatigue/illness and I am not one for service dogs/esa's in public areas that do not have an actual service.

Ever since I took him out of service we have struggled with his need for exercise and stimulation. He's been okay, but now that the world is moving again after lockdown I am now working full time and my energy limitations are becoming a huge problem. Nothing wears my dog out physically except for full blown running. Going on walks does absolutely nothing for him. I can't take him on his mountain hikes everyday like I used to since I'm working again. So I'm stuck trying to figure out what to do with this dog that needs so much and I don't have it to give him. He's fighting me on all of my attempts to exercise him that isn't a hour at the dog park, which I really am not comfortable with, or going on a physical hike.

We have a large fenced in backyard so I bought him a tennis ball launcher thinking he would be so happy to be able to throw the ball for himself. Nope. He won't use it himself and he won't play fetch in our backyard even if I throw the ball. Dog park all day long. Open space absolutely. Random city park, yep. Backyard, nope no fetch. In the backyard he just starts chewing on sticks and laying down. He refuses to run. Just sit and destroy sticks. Then I get frustrated and come back inside to which he bangs on the back door to follow me. Then he gets back in and he starts staring and whining at me to exercise him. He loves training and mental stimulation, but it doesn't wear him out! We can have a 30 minutes training session and he will still be high strung and looking at me to take him somewhere. I know he is dependent on me from his service dog days, but he won't do anything without my presence and I don't know how to break that.

Other things I've tried: frisbee in the backyard - he just takes the frisbee and wants to destroy it. Scent work - he loses interest after a couple finds. Leaving the back door open to the yard - won't ever go out unless I do and then he just wants to eat sticks. Leaving him outside to do whatever he pleases - sits and bangs on the door. Walks - do absolutely nothing.

Things I can't do: Dog daycare - too much money at the moment. Dog park - he loves it, but it scares me and there isn't one super close to us. Hiking daily - not enough energy while working. Any sort of competition - can't afford to take him to dock diving, agility, etc.

I am at my wits end that my one time service dog is now impacting my health and mental sanity. He has started acting out in the house because he's bored and under exercised, but he's fighting me at everything I can do because it's not what he wants to do. I'm trying so hard to help him, but he won't respond to anything I've tried and I don't know what else to try.

(Sorry if that image link doesn’t work or the quality is low, if you need a better picture just let me know)

My dog (4.5 year old Great Dane/Mastiff) has a spot on her belly. It’s on her right side where her leg meets her belly. It’s kinda football shaped and about 8-10” long and 3-4” tall (rough estimates). It doesn’t ever seem to bother her - she doesn’t lick it, seemed bothered by it if you touch it, it doesn’t bleed or weep. She had it last winter and we took her to the vet twice. Both times they gave us a pill for her to take and neither pill seemed to have an any effect on it. I suggested ringworm both times and neither time the vet wanted to test or treat it as ringworm because neither my wife nor I had similar spots on us and said they didn’t think it was ringworm. Over the summer it seemed to diminish but it was still there if you looked. Now we’re back to winter and it’s starting to get red and noticeable again. Exact same symptoms this time around and it still doesn’t seem to bother her at all. Every once in awhile the edges seem redder than usual and it does look a tad bigger. I’m not going to the vet again. We spent $500 and got nowhere last time, and they didn’t seem concerned about it. I’m looking for advice for an OTC cream or paste I can put on it to help. We have a donut collar we can use with it too so I’m not worried about her messing with any cream on it.

554,dogs,"My dog Charlie, a Border Collie somewhere around 12 years old, is beginning to slow down in his old age and his heart condition is slowly getting worse. Everyday I am afraid that it will be the last that I get to spend with him, and am terrified of losing him.

I have a history of mental health issues, which are admittedly ongoing, and I am afraid of what I would do to myself when he does pass. Years ago, as a teenager when we first got him, I was unable to attend school for a couple of years due to my severe depression and anxiety. When my family told me that they had decided to get a dog I was very upset about it, as at the time I did not like dogs at all and was actually quite afraid of them. Once he did get him, I initially wanted nothing to do with him. But since I was the only one who was home all day, I was kinda forced to look after him. After my initial discomfort with this, we quickly began to develop a strong bond with each other as we were always in each others company. Because of this, I managed to actually start leaving my house regularly, after years of being a shut-in, to take him for walks. My mental health began to improve over time, and managed to bring myself to get into the learning support unit at my school and finish my GCSE's, something which seemed impossible before. I even managed to attend regular classes once I reached sixth form(which I guess is just the last two years of high school for non-UK people), and honestly this is all thanks to him being a part of my life. I genuinely do not see how I would have made it that far without him, he saved my life.

Despite my ongoing mental health issues, one thing that has helped me immensely is going for walks with him. I take him for walks everyday and this is admittedly usually the only reason I will leave the house most days. He is my best friend, and I love him more than anything. I cannot imagine my life without him, and I cannot imagine that I will be able to handle losing him. But I will some day, and it could be soon. I'm not really sure what the purpose of this post is tbh, I just felt the need to make it.

I love dogs. Always had them growing up, just used to having one in my life, when I was 19 I got a husky puppy. She was the love of my life and continued the streak of my love for having a dog. Taking them to the park, walking them, loving on them etc…always pictured this as part of who I am. 
She passed away in a terrible accident 6 months ago and I’ve been toying with whether to get another dog recently.

Not worrying about coming home straight after work, staying back for drinks every Friday, doing whatever, whenever basically. 
I’ve currently got a husky on trial, she arrived yesterday and suddenly I feel like I’ve hit a road block. Having to stay home with her to watch her habits, scheduling appointments at certain times so that someone can be home to watch her when I go out, worrying about her while I’m working…it’s exhausting and I’m second guessing whether I want this massive responsibility.

They’ve also come on other occasions where they walk into my driveway the middle of the night and attempt to open up my other cars parked in the driveway. The cops can’t do anything. I have cameras all around my property but these guys always come in an unmarked car and no license plate so cops obviously have nothing to work with. 
I have never owned a dog myself but in my home country we had a farm and we had 3 caucasian shepherds who would never let anyone get near the property. They lived outside all year and had a heated kennel that they had access to 24 hours but being caucasian shepherds they always preferred to sleep together outside near the cattle. I obviously don’t have enough experience for a caucasian shepherd and they are a huge liability to own in the states. 
I was wondering if it’s cruel to get a German shepherd that would live outside most of the year. Obviously if it snows or gets below 30 degrees he’d be staying inside the house. The reason I want him outside is to deter the people who keep coming in my driveway in the middle of the night trying to steal my cars. He would only be socialized with my family. We are a family of 8. Our driveway and backyard are fenced with a 6 foot fence and are about 1.5 acres in total. He would have free roam of the yard and I would be building him a heated kennel. I would plan on taking him to obedience training. I can walk him mornings and my father can walk him at night. 
I have younger siblings that love dogs and would be playing with him plenty since they enjoy being outdoors. My only concern is would this be cruel to keep him as my guard dog? He would be a family dog but his main job is to watch the property and protect my family. Is there a breed that would be more suitable?

My boy just turned one this last month, and is our little baby.  When he was growing up we noticed him doing a bit of a bunny hop when running at mid-speed in our backyard.  We discussed with our vet but after physical exam the vet said he doesnt see anything worth noting and to wait until he is a bit more mature.

6 months later we brought him in for his annual exam and physical.  The vet mentioned he whined when he stretched his leg back.  

We are planning to have an xray done but are weighing our options before a diagnosis is official/not official.  Researching insurances in the unfortunate case he does have hip dysplasia.  

My question is, what insurances would this group recommend, and does anyone have experience with what would constitute a pre-existing condition.  I assume if we sign up for insurance and they rescue vet notes theres probably some mention of the bunny hopping and now the most recent physical.  I am worried this would trigger any insurance company to mark this as pre-existing even without the official diagnosis. 

If we have to get surgery we will, but obviously if there is an avenue for getting insurance to cover in the worst case scenario that would be ideal.

588,dogs,"So my 8 year old Beagle has been diagnosed with Arthritis in his Hip Joint . He was sleeping one day and suddenly woke up whining and started licking his back legs and was unable to walk properly. He had undergone a surgery for bladder stones 3 months back and because of the doctors negligence a stone was left in his body and he was stitched up. Because of that he couldn't heal for 12 days and i had to give him NSAD (painkillers).  but fortunately the stone came to the skin surface and no surgery was needed again . But his liver got affected by it . and Still his liver is enlarged . I had been drained for the past 3 months running around the vets and taking care of him. i am really attached to my dog as he is my first dog. Now we stand at a position where we cant give him Painkillers for long because of his liver issue and i cant see him in pain . He becomes very uncomfortable without the painkillers and it kills me to see him like this. Arthritis is a degenerative disease and its just going to get worse . i am the only one at home to take care of him as my parents are old . and i work so i cant stay at home. The negativity has taken over my mind since his surgery and ive been soo worked up with him that ive developed a low key depression where i donnt want to eat much , i stay sleepy most of the times . dont feel like going out .

Not gonna get into details about my situation, but my childhood dog remains there. I sort of had plans to take him with me, but it wouldn't work. He's old, and being placed in a new environment wouldn't bode well with him. I just don't feel it's the right decision.

I'm 100% for leaving that place. Every time I go back in there I feel so empty and numb, looking at any corner I can remember several memories of, erm, painful things happening, to put it lightly.

But... when I said goodbye to my lil pup... a sudden feeling of dread washed over me. So intense I nearly burst into tears immediately. The thing I was avoiding had come. I had to leave him behind.

When I was having late night dance parties, as a way to have fun and let off steam, he was my judge and would always watch.

When I went on walks with him, he would always have the biggest smile.

When I taught him to ""search"" for treats, I was so proud.

Anything I did, I had him there if I ever needed him. He would always help me and comfort me and just... be there.

So I've always heard that scent hounds are not very easy to train and are not obedient dogs because they were bred to act and think independently. I guess that's why they're not used as military or police dogs as much, even though they're scent oriented.

But shepherd dogs were also bred to work independently, and they're very obedient when you work with them, they actually enjoy it very much unlike the scent hounds who only seem to tolerate it. And they're the perfect dogs for police and military work, especially German Shepherds and Malinois.

Hi, I've always wanted a pet but because I've been struggling with pollen and dust mite allergy my whole life, doctors have not recommended it. 

I've been around cats and had some reactions to them, i even got to borrow one at one point to try to live with it for a while, and i got very sick. However I've never had a reaction to dogs, and overall my allergy to animals is negative or 0.1 on tests. I've had doctors tell me they could get worse if i am around them, but they seemed more positive when i told them i would not let a dog sleep in my bed, or even be in my bedroom for that matter. 

I am chronically ill living on disability aid not being able to work/study, and without friends in my hometown. I rarely get out, so a dog would help me in that and to help my mental health. I live in an apartment in my parents house so they can help out when i don't have the strength to do so. I live in the middle of nowhere, shelters are hours and hours away, and finding a hypoallergenic dog is hard and rare to come across. Especially going to see if i do get a reaction, and then there's the risk of not reacting to petting, but reacting to living with it. However there are some hypoallergenic dogs showing up now and then, I've been close to getting one several times, but the fear of me getting a reaction is so big i never go through with it. I also know that if i get a reaction, that reaction might go away after a while, or get worse. I love animals, especially dogs, and i know I'd be heartbroken if i had to give it back (which i doubt i could since i have to do some traveling to go get the dog, and not everyone accepts it back) or give it away to someone in the area, and it would be very strange for the puppy as well. I just don't know what to do, my life would really improve getting a dog so I'm willing to try even if it means living with symptoms for a while.

597,dogs,"So I'm literally at my wits end with my pit terrier mix. In the last year, year and a half, his nails have started growing STUPIDLY fast. I don't know what brought it about, there weren't any health concerns, any injuries, nothing like that, but now his front claws are growing so fast that I can't keep up with them.

I trim them once a week; the problem is, it's not enough. But even when I take just the tips, they gush blood, and it hurts him. But it seems like the more I cut them, the faster they're growing back.

I took him to our vet, and he said that, for $200, he'd do a surgical trim, but he couldn't tell me why they were growing that fast, other than 'sometimes they just do that'. While I would spend the money in a heartbeat if it'd fix the problem, I can't afford $200 every month, you know?

At this point, I don't know what to do. Some friends recommended getting him declawed (which, I didn't even know that was a thing for dogs), but that's basically the same thing as removing humans' fingers at the first knuckle. But if I can't come up with another solution, I'm running out of options; he's in pain, because these damn claws are growing so fast, but he's in pain if I trim them, and they just won't stop growing.

Please. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, I don't know if it's relevant, but all of his front claws are white/clear-ish, while his back claws are black.

I've raised golden retrievers, had an amazing medium breed (~30lb) terrier who could give me a run for my money in tug-o-war at my 215lb at the time, among other dogs in my life. I knew my puppy was going to be higher energy, but I've had problems breaking certain habits when it comes to people.

I've been a pet-parent to both smart animals, and ones that are... more simple. She is smart as a whip, and can learn things quickly. Of course it's usually if it suits what she wants (like if she brings the wrong rope for tugging, I tell her to get the other rope, she runs to find it).

600,dogs,"**Dog flu, or canine influenza, is a highly contagious viral infection that affects dogs.** It is caused by two types of influenza virus: H3N8 and H3N2. Both of these strains are believed to have originated from avian influenza viruses that have adapted to be able to infect dogs. 

Canine influenza is spread through direct contact with an infected dog, or through contact with objects that have been contaminated with the virus. This includes objects such as food and water bowls, toys, bedding, and even people's hands. The virus is also spread through the air when an infected dog coughs or sneezes.

# Dog Flu Symptoms:

The most common symptoms of dog flu include **coughing, sneezing, a runny nose, and a fever.** Some dogs may also experience difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, and lethargy. It's important to note that while dog flu is highly contagious, it is not usually life-threatening. Most dogs recover in a few weeks with proper treatment. 

# How To Prevent Dog Flu?

In order to prevent Dog Flu, it is important to keep your dog away from other dogs that may be infected. Vaccination is also an important tool in preventing the spread of the virus. The vaccine is typically given as a series of two injections, two to four weeks apart. It is important to note that the vaccine will not prevent your dog from becoming infected, but it can reduce the severity of the illness and the likelihood of spreading the virus to other dogs. 

Finally, it is important to keep your dog up to date with regular veterinary check-ups. Your veterinarian can help you determine if your dog is at risk for canine influenza, and can provide the necessary vaccinations and treatments if your dog does become infected. It is also important to practice good hygiene and to keep your dog away from other dogs that may be infected. 

By taking the necessary precautions, you can help keep your dog safe from the dangers of canine influenza.",t2_rnvrwy8o,0,USA Facing Dog Flu Outbreak: What is dog flu?

601,dogs,"My husband and I just moved to a big city and are looking to get a dog. We both grew up with dogs; he always had smaller toy breeds (toy poodles, pomeranian, etc.) while I grew up in the country with large and giant dogs (mostly muts, Great Danes, greyhound mixes). Our apartment is 750 sqft (and large dog friendly!) and we live right across the block from a large park with a fenced dog run.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

No. We were both primary caretakers for our childhood dogs. We have taught basic commands (sit, lay down, stay) but will want to do more structured obedience training with this dog as we live in an apartment and will need to be extra-well behaved.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? 

We plan on rescuing/adopting from the pound. His childhood dogs came from breeders (not by his choice or preference) while mine were always rescues. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

We are looking for a quiet companion with a quirky personality (like us). We'd definitely prefer one that's more on the couch-potato side of the spectrum, rather than a super active and energetic dog. They would be the only dog in the household.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

We both prefer a medium or large dog. I would say there are more breeds that I am trying to avoid than specific ones I'm looking for. Huskies, German Shepherds, and herding dogs are hard nos for us. I love Great Danes, but my parents recently got a 2 year old GD/Mastiff mix and as lovely as she is, she has made me realize that giant breeds are not a great fit for us right now. Greyhounds seem to do very well in apartments and I love all sight hounds. I also have a soft spot for mystery mutts. I'd be interested to hear more ideas.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

Definitely obedience- I'm toying with the idea of working towards the Canine Good Citizen certification, as I've heard it can be helpful when looking to rent in the city (in the case we have to move to another, less dog friendly building than where we are now). 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

Nope!

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

We would both likely have around 4 hours per day. My husband has an irregular schedule that rotates the days every week and the shift every 6 weeks. It's complicated. I work a standard 9-5 with 2 work-from-home days a week. This means that our weekends and time off doesn't always overlap, meaning the dog would spend less time alone than if we both worked standard schedules.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We would likely do 2-3 walks a day (depending on my husband's rotation). As I mentioned, we have access to a large park with a fenced dog run.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

We would be getting a short-haired dog. We would be down for some weekly brushing. We would pay for professionals to work on nails and ears.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  

Medium to large.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

Shedding- short hair shedding is fine with us.

Barking- we have a low tolerance for barking given that we live in a building with lots of other dogs.

Slobber- I'm used to it.  

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

This is something I would really like to work towards, but I recognize it can be hard to achieve. Growing up in the middle of nowhere on lots of land, we always relied on the older dogs to teach the younger ones how to be off-leash. I'm willing to dampen my expectations on this one.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

I'm sure we all want one who'd be both, but we would prefer one that's more snuggly.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

We're happy to have one that wants to do its own thing. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

We'd like one that wasn't too strongly reactive given our living situation. We'd like a dog that was calm when strangers entered the house. It's only natural for a dog to get excited for both of these, though, so we are willing to accept intense butt wiggles and whining or something similar. We would not want jumping on strangers, though. These are lofty goals that require training and conditioning and we are very willing to work on this.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

We would be a single dog household, but we live in a building with other dogs. Some aggression is tolerable, but it would need to be something we could work on as a team.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? 

My husband's family has a dog that's a poodle/Cavalier Charles Spaniel mix from a breeder and he has significant territorial urination problems to the point that he has to wear a diaper 24/7. I've never met another dog that did this, but it's something that has impacted the dog's quality of life and something we'd like to avoid as well.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

As previously stated, my husband has a rotating schedule and I work hybrid, so it wouldn't be a fixed number, but the maximum would be 7 hours a day, 4 days a week. I would crate train and see how it suits the dog before allowing more liberty. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

My husband and I worked on this together and both our preferences are in each answer. We split the work equally. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they? 

No other animals.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

No. The only circumstance would be out in the city on walks or potentially when visiting with family.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

We rent and will for the next 5-ish years. Our current building is totally dog friendly with no restrictions. We are very lucky for that!  

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

I'm not aware of any banned breeds in our city (D.C.)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

Swampy summers (85-90F) and mild-ish winters (30-40F).

604,dogs,"I’ve always wanted to foster and this year I finally had the time and space to be able to do it. I got my first foster a week ago. A 4 month old pittie puppy who was dumped at the emergency vet overdosed on oxy. 

She is such a blast. She’s so fun, smart and has these soulful eyes that make you just melt. I totally love her, and my full time dog (another pittie) even more so. 

I considered keeping her, but my dog is big and my foster is gonna be even bigger and I rent so I know that it’s already hard enough to rent with one big dog, let alone two. 

The rescue found a home for her with a wonderful family who lost their dog over summer to a brain tumor.

606,dogs,"I have dreamed about getting a Golden Retriever my entire life. I always assumed that it's not possible for me until I'm more settled and have a stable home. I'm in my mid-35s and single, not settled and plan to move country at some point. I started looking into smaller breeds so that I can travel more easily and so that when I fly, I can take the dog in the cabin with me. I don't want for my dog to travel in the cargo! I settled on the Cavapoo and even paid a deposit. However, I can't help but wonder if I should just go for my dream breed, which is the Golden. I feel like having a big dog such as a Golden Retriever is such a different experience all around. I found a wonderful breeder in a location I actually want to move to (but it doesn't require flights/cargo, so it's all fine) and I immediately felt even more excited about this. However, I DO plan to move around quite a bit and don't even drive. This will be in Europe, so I can travel by train. The main issue will arise with my plan to actually relocate to the USA. I'm not sure when it'll be, but likely not for at least another 6-9 months or so. I don't know what to do. This would involve a transatlantic flight and cargo is the only option for this size dog. If I go for the Cavapoo, I can still travel with him/her in the cabin and the only issue is sometimes being limited with routes/airlines. I don't plan to fly back and forth from the US, but who knows - I may need more than one trip due to the visa, but perhaps I wouldn't need to take the dog each time. I don't know...this move is not even guaranteed and perhaps I am worrying too much about the cargo? If I was to do that, I would hire a pet travel company which would at least look after it before and after the flight, but I'm not sure that helps with temperature changes, etc. I think that this one trip is the ONLY thing that's making me reconsider getting a Golden.   


I think that I would still love a Cavapoo because I love all dogs, really. So perhaps it's a good compromise and getting one will still be nice, but somewhat easier with travel. I am mostly looking for a furry, loyal companion and Cavapoos seem cuddly and affectionate. Having said that, if I even see a photo of a Golden, let alone a video (or in person!), my heart immediately skips a beat and I want one so bad! Sometimes I wonder if I am putting off my dream too long - waiting to be settled, have a stable home, etc...on the other hand, perhaps it's selfish to be getting a Golden now? Even without the transatlantic flight, I will be staying in different accommodation for a while - perhaps moving every 2-3 months. How much do they need stability?   
Apart from the travel issues, I do have plenty of time I can devote to the puppy, so that part isn't an issue.

He acted and ate like he usually did and didn’t show any discomfort. However today at 8 pm he vomited shortly after eating and running in circles over and over playing with a new laser pointer we got. I think he may have gotten dizzy but am not completely sure. He stood still for a bit and licked his upper lip over and over for like 10 times. After he vomited he made a hacking noise a few times. His vomit was green and had quite big pieces of baby carrots in it and pieces of his food. He swallows his food whole and never chews on it. He didn’t make the hacking noise before vomiting. An hour later he made the noise several times again. He is playing and eating like normal after and doesnt have any trouble pooping. He seems comfortable when i apply pressure to his stomach.  I am just nervous its from the tree bark or something he may have ate we didnt know about. Or i may be overreacting and it is from dizziness after running in circles over and over.

We have to put my 10 year old dog down this weekend. She has kidney disease and is so skinny. She can’t go to the washroom and she’s getting sick every day. She’s sleeping all day and can’t really walk around that much anymore. 

I know it’s time. But the thing is I am at school two and a half hours away from home. My mom asked me to make a decision whether I wanted to come home and say goodbye or be okay with the goodbye that I said to her on the weekend when I was home. I really don’t know what to do. I loved her up as much as I could on the weekend and I did say goodbye. But I can’t stop thinking about how I slightly pushed her away this weekend because I was done cuddling her. But seeing her getting a needle stuck in her and watching her die, it’s a really scary thought to me. I really don’t know what my gut is telling me. My mom is the one who’s taking care of her every day all these years and my dad will be there so I know she’ll be surrounded by people she loves so she won’t be scared. But I love her and I want to be with her.

616,dogs,"I'm not sure how to handle this situation differently, as each time it ends with the other dog owner feeling the need to tell ME how to manage MY dog.

We own small dogs, they are generally just not good with other dogs. We never go to busy dog parks, we go to very quiet areas and avoid other dogs at all costs. Our dogs hate interacting with other dogs and it just ends in disaster all the time. They DO get along with their own breed and dogs that we spend a long time introducing them to, but that is it. When another dog is at the park we walk the other way, and are constantly scouting for dogs that don't look under control. 

Last night we were walking across a park towards a footpath, my dog was at my heels, and an enormous dog rushed me out of nowhere. I barely had time to pick her up before their dog was at my side. The owner made no attempt to call their dog back, they just yelled ""it's fine, he is friendly"". His dog was approx 20 x the size of my dog, he then started calling it and it wasn't returning to him.  I chose to say nothing to the owner and just carried my dog away. He then fired up at me saying ""PUT YOUR DOG DOWN, IT WILL BE BETTER FOR IT"". I turned around and said ""I don't need you to tell me how to look after my dog""

I have encountered this before because the owner said they would not be responsible for their dog jumping up on me if I was holding my dog in my arms...

617,dogs,Hi everyone. I have a 1.5 year old dachshund mix. We take him to get his nails clipped every couple weeks at pet supplies plus. He absolutely hates it. We tried slow introductions and whatnot but no improvement. It’s to the point where he cannot hear the nail file turn on or he goes bonkers. He is doing better with just straight clipping though. He went today and a few of his nails have “splits” on the side where it looks like the nail is a little torn off. I’m sure it’s because he’s fussy during the trim.

619,dogs,"Hi! 

My Dalmatian has been limping for a few days. On and off. It’s not like him to fake things. 

When I touch his leg he doesn’t cry or whimper, I’ve even stretched it out and not a peep. I’ve looked through his paws, nothing. He doesn’t cry when he does limp around or puts in on the ground. Honestly,
he hasn’t even whimpered once since he started limping. 

It randomly came out of nowhere too. When I came home from the store, he was limping. He was perfectly fine before I left. So I assumed while I was gone he must of hurt himself. Which is odd because this has NEVER happened before! He has separation anxiety so when I leave I put everything up (as he’ll chew shoes, remotes and get into the trash), close doors to the rooms and put a dog show on for him. 

He was playing fine last night w the neighbor dog. I even caught him walking on his paw normally this morning. On our second walk he was limping again and holding his paw up. 

I hate to think he’s faking? Is this normal? He has pet insurance, so no issue to take him to the vet!!

620,dogs,"I own a 2 year and 5 month old Labrador Retriever (female) that doesn't like the sound of Certain Mii Voices while i'm playing.

So far, it seems like she doesn't like the Male Purple Mii Voice, but seems quite pleased or so (and quiet) when the Female Red Mii Voice is talking. I've tried my own Mii of myself, which is a deep voice with dark green and male, and a Light Green Male Mii Voice she seems quiet when hearing. Light Blue Female Voices don't seem to bother her... And Light Green Female voices seem rather calming to her as well. And she can hear this coming from the next 2 rooms in my house. I live in a trailer home with my folks, and am 27. My parents don't seem to notice the sounds playing, but my dog does. What could be going on??? Is my Lab's instinct to flush out triggering when she hears these sounds?

When I mentioned the possibility of mice in our house causing issues with her (since we caught the first mouse around the time she developed issues) the vet was very quick to dismiss that idea and did not elaborate on why and just said “that’s not the issue.” 

I feel like something is wrong with her, she looks skinnier, her spine is sticking out more, her rib cage/upper stomach looks bloated, and she still doesn’t eat her food.

637,dogs,"Just a bit of some frustration with some actual questions thrown in.

**Up front tl;dr**: rescue organization's contract is very open ended WRT detailed requirements (meds, training, etc.) with the penalty of reclaiming the dog, and I'm pondering when the dog I rescued is *truly* my dog.

**Details**: I rescued a dog from a reputable organization about a month ago. I've had rescue dogs in the past, so this isn't my first rodeo regarding ownership. Went through the home inspection one day, the in-person visit (about an hour's drive form home) the next day, and took the 3 mo. old pup home the third day. On the take-home day I signed the contract but had quite a few hypothetical questions running through my head based on some included items. My partner signed without hesitating, but on our way home we had a lengthy discussion. The contract contains things such as:

(Timeline stipulations/expirations for the below are non-existent when not outlined)

* If the Adopter decides, at any time, to enroll in a training program, the Adopter will advise (Rescue) and will secure written authorization from (Rescue) prior to enrollment. If the Adopter enrolls in a training program that (Rescue) does not approve, the Adopter agrees to surrender the pet immediately.
* Adopter shall take puppy for potty breaks as follows:
   * (numerous intervals of no less than 2-4 hours depending on age)
* Adopter shall let the puppy out for socialization as follows:
   * (numerous intervals of no less than 2-4 hours depending on age)
* The Adopter acknowledges that at any time (Rescue) can inquire about the health/well-being of the pet...Adopter must allow (Rescue) to examine pet within 24 hour notice. (no expiry of this noted)
* Adopter acknowledges that (Rescue) has the right to rescind this contract and remove the pet from Adopter's possession at any time for any reason within 120 days of adoption (with or without cause).
* Adopter acknowledges that upon any breach of any of the contract terms, (Rescue) will have the right to rescind the contract and remove the pet from Adopter's possession.
* If a lawsuit arises to enforce any contractual terms, the Adopter is liable for all court costs and legal fees.

I understand the need for having stipulations of these nature (and other obvious/agreeable ones), and I appreciate the effort. I've heard a lot of stories bad environments and of ill-intent by people attempting to adopt. I fully intend on keeping the rescue looped in and compliant of the contract, but the way these items were worded has me questioning ""Even for a good owner, this contract leaves the door open for the rescue to take back the dog whenever they want."" When does the dog truly become mine and I can stop providing evidence I'm not Cruella Deville? Can they, say, in 5 years inquire about the health and start moving on us if we don't respond to them? (not that we wouldn't)

My mind is just going to dark places of lawsuits or my dog being reclaimed because I haven't provided evidence to the rescue that I have, in fact, administered year-round tick meds 3 years from now. 

Anyone with rescue experience see these types of open-ended requirements?

640,dogs,"I have a senior JRT (13) who is struggling with Diabetes and incontinence and I am looking for advice.

He has so many health conditions, but Diabetes is what is ruining our lives. He was diagnosed a year ago and we have not been able to successfully manage his symptoms since. He currently takes 16 units of insulin 2x per day and it’s just not effective. In addition to Diabetes, he is on Thyroid medication and has kidney/liver damage. We’ve been in and out of the vet for over three years trying to keep his health in check.

He is thirsty all day long and pees constantly through the day and night. He has stopped asking to go outside and just pees whenever he needs to go. He also poops inside the house now whenever he needs to go. We are cleaning up his messes around the house and his kennel about 6-8 times per day. When he urinates, it is a large amount. I cannot express just how much pee he produces for a 20 lb dog. It is full-on lakes that have ruined the flooring throughout my entire home. The stench is my home in awful.

Nighttime is the worst. He is up every all night long crying and whining for water. If we give him water, he will pee all night long. We have been trying to control his diabetes with the vet for a year now and thousands of dollars later, we are no where near healthy or in control. 

He’s not showing end of life signs though. I would feel awful putting him down because he doesn’t seem “sick” other than the constant thirst and urination. He still enjoys eating and treats and toys and walks. I don’t want to end his life but his needs are becoming too overwhelming. We are not sleeping at night, are constantly cleaning up after him, and we are unable to leave him in order to go on vacations or overnight trips. I don’t know how much longer I can keep up living life like this. Our family is miserable. We are all suffering from depression because of this dog and we don’t know what to do.

648,dogs,"Writing this on mobile so sorry if the format is messed up. 

My sister has recently rescued a German shepherd/ husky puppy while trying to start graduate school in a brand new city. He is 7 months old, and although this isn’t her first time training and raising a dog, it is her first time doing it alone. I’m sure you could tell by the breed that this puppy ended up being handful. She is now about 4 months into ownership and it’s become very apparent that he is too much to handle for her mentally and physically, especially since she works and goes to school. 

About 2 months ago she decided to start putting him in a nice daycare where they train and care for the dogs. This has now developed into the puppy spending pretty much 55-65% of his time in daycare. The only days he is not is the weekends. So I talked to her and we both came to the conclusion that this is no way to raise a dog and it would be best to get him in a better fitting home while he’s still young. 

So the problem is not getting my sister to understand that she can’t take care of the puppy, she agrees that it would be a better decision for the dog to be in a home with a big yard and a loving family, shes just worried that he will be too much for them and they will give him to the pound or she’s worried that he will think she abandoned him “What if he tries looking for me and can’t find me. He will have no idea that I’m never coming back for him”. I’m sure every pet owner can sympathize with that last part. She loves this dog with all her heart and it breaks my heart to see her make this decision, but I’m confident that it is the right one.

Basically what I would like help with is to see if any of you knew the best way to put up a dog for adoption. She doesn’t want to just give him away without knowing he’s going to a good family. She would like to receive updates on him which I know is never going to be a guarantee, but I was wondering if there were any apps or websites or communities like this wonderful one where we could get the ball rolling.",t2_dzswk,0,"My sister has a puppy that she cannot take care of, looking for ideas, please help.","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zem7pv,True,DudeThatPlaysTheDude,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zem7pv/my_sister_has_a_puppy_that_she_cannot_take_care/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zem7pv/my_sister_has_a_puppy_that_she_cannot_take_care/,2467660,1670370524,0,,False,1670370538,1670370539,2022-12-06 23:48:44,,,,,

653,dogs,"13 yrd old pupper, she adopted me after my brother got her for his gf. She's a barky, loveable cuddly girl. I am going to miss her terribly. Time to grieve but focus on the great times weve had. 

She has always brightened up my day no matter what it had for me. Coming home and seeing her sparked a special type of joy. She is my anti depressant. Over the last year or so her health has been declining, incontinence, flu like symptoms, lethargic, etc. Got her checked out early Oct and labs came back fine. About 10-14 days ago she stopped eating her wet/dry fresh veg mix. Drinking more water, back in Sept too. Over the last week or so she's only eaten chewed up turkey/boiled chicken but in low doses. 

Finally got her seen today and expected but hoped for better new. Severe kidney failure. Sort of prepped myself for this but it's a total rush of emotions getting the news. $2k a day for 24/7 IV care with little to no guarantee. We've opted to give her one more chance by doing a 3 day IV treatment so I can bring her in and pick her up each morning/night. 

Say a pray for my little girl. May she battle strong and respond well to this. She's a strong one. I will continue to love her so much and give her all the cuddles and kisses I can until we found out what's next.

Whichever way it turns out, I'm looking to do in home euthanasia when it gets to that point (this week, next month or hopefully several months down the road).

656,dogs,"I rescued a red heeler about a month and a half ago. He is the best dog. Before I rescued him, the adoption org told me he had ""minor"" OCD and that I would not even notice it or need to worry about it. However, it is absolutely not minor and he is constantly getting fixated on lights and shadows. I have already tried to take remedial steps, but his fixation just seems constant and I am feeling SO defeated. 

He goes insane in the car because of all the lights and shadows so he is now in a car crate and that has drastically improved our car rides.  I make sure there are so lights/reflections in my apartment from the windows or anything. I got him on Fluoxetine about 3-4 weeks ago. I try to distract/re-direct him when he gets fixated. However, he will still flip out at light reflections and stares at specific spots on the wall or couch  (even if I do not see anything) and it feels constant. As much as I try, I cannot be re-re-directing him 24/7 and constantly monitoring every move he makes. 

In a lot of reading I have been doing on the breed (which my fam has owned before) and OCD, I feel like I try to do what everyone suggests. We go on 2-3 walks a day, I play with him, I give him mentally stimulating toys (Kongs, lick mats, etc.) to wear him out, I try to re-direct as much as possible. 

He is also deaf so, while that itself has not been an issue for us, it does add an extra element to the whole thing because it requires that I go up to him to re-direct the fixation. 

I feel so defeated because even with all the remedial measures I am trying to take, it just feels like it doesn't help. The meds have not kicked in yet as far as I can tell. As soon as I re-direct or give him a something to distract, he goes right back to the spot on the wall or couch or wherever it may be at the moment. It is all day, everyday. He eats normal and everything, but I feel like I am constantly, unsuccessfully re-directing him. I am feeling so defeated and like I am not doing enough for him to help his OCD. I know I probably need to give it more time, but the feeling of defeat and anxiety that it won't improve is taking over.

660,dogs,"
Hi all,

I'm new here, so I hope this sort of request for help is permitted. 

My wife and I recently adopted a rescue dog. We don't know much about her background, but here is what we do know (or at least what we think we know):

-	She’s about 5/6
-	She was kept for breeding and has definitely had a few litters. The place we adopted her from thinks she came from a puppy farm. 
-	She never lived indoors until she came to us. 
-	We think she’s a cavapoo (King Charles Cavalier crossed with a Poodle). She is definitely King Charles as she has the nose and eyes. I’m not so sure about the Poodle part, but who knows?
-	She is SUCH a sweet girl. 

When she came to us (8 weeks ago) she wasn't house trained and was very nervous. She's house trained beautiful and done really well. She gets on well with our other dog and they live quite happily next to each other. 

The issue we have is that she barks as me. A lot. When we're in the room together sitting quietly, she's fine. She sits next to me, cuddles up, asks for affection and is loving. But when I stand up or move, she barks. And won't stop. Interestingly she doesn't do this with my wife. She absolutely adores my wife and runs to her for protection. 

Obviously we don't know about her background, but the fact I'm a 6 foot 5 inch guy and my wife is a 5 foot 2 women, leads me to think that's got something to do with it. I'm hypothesising but maybe she was mistreated by a tall man. 

Other than giving her time, and me taking responsibility for feeding her meals and treats and lots of affection, are there any tips as to how I can help her feel less anxious? As I say, she's not constantly wary of me, just when I stand up, move, leave/enter the room etc. She also seems worse at night. 

She's such a sweet dog and we want her to be as happy as possible, but we're worried her barking is sending our neighbours crazy!

663,dogs,"Hello,  
I am struggling immensely with my 4 y/o coonhound. I worked with dogs for a few years doing training and daycare stuff with a very experienced trainer. I got my dog at 13 weeks and truly feel I did everything right with socialization. His upbringing was my entire life. We worked hard on neutrality to people/dogs when out and about, practiced trade offs a lot (the breed is prone to resource guarding), having guests over, and more. We went to training classes weekly and even did some desensitization training with our vet in the clinic. We hiked down local trails almost daily and still do twice a week plus walks and tons of training.  


Well, he ended up a reactive anxious mess, regardless of our efforts. It started with frustration on the leash, he wanted to play with the other dogs. He would howl and scream at them and run around, pull, etc. We worked with our trainer on it, but it made no difference. It started around adolescence, 8 months. It became dreadful to bring him out, even though he used to be so well behaved in public people would record us as we practiced tricks for his trick titles. He just howled at everything and everyone.  


Then came the resource guarding. It started with a guest, and I hoped it was simply because my dog didn't trust them, but it quickly progressed despite practicing sessions from the book Mine! by Jean D. and working with our trainer. The resource guarding became dangerous within just months of starting. It still is. If he is resting we cant even LOOK his way or move around, he will growl and lunge even if you are across the room. He will do the same behavior in the crate, but much more severe, at least we are protected from him though.  


We went to a behaviorist at 16months old. They told us my dog has no threshold for frustration and will always be ""reactive"" in life. Rather than thinking and processing his emotions, he reacts to them. He is also extremely possessive, smart, and demanding. He uses his bark to get his way, uses aggression to get his way, and it works. We can't take a bite from a 90lb dog just because he doesn't want to go outside and potty yet. He was prescribed prozac.  


Now at 4y/o, we are extremely uncomfortable around him. He now has seizure-like outbursts of aggression and has tried to bite my partner in the face for again, just glancing at him from across the room. His head wobbles back and forth during these episodes and his eyes glaze over. We feel that we cannot give him ANYTHING of pleasure to him, because he will guard it with his life. He is an unstable, scary dog. The only time we feel okay around him is when he is sleeping, and even then, we have to be careful not to get too close to him or touch him. He is not affectionate, it feels like all he does all day is bully us. We had a trainer come over to our home to work on it and again, failed to see much progress. We can't seem to get him in a state where he can think about his actions and make decisions, he just acts on impulse.   


We already have an extremely strict level of management for him, including wearing a muzzle for a good part of the day, and whenever he is resting outside his crate. He wears a leash 24/7, and this has saved us from bites.  


Our vet said there is nothing more we can do medically for him, even after pleading that I may need to euthanize this dog and would do ANYTHING to help him. The worst part is we still love him and dont want to even rehome (wouldn't be possible regardless due to his history of attacking owners), much less euthanize. But we fear that the time is coming, now that he has learned that he can bite us too.  


Thanks for reading. This was kind of just a vent, but also a cry for help. Any advice, even if it's a slap in the face for me, is wanted and needed. I feel like such a failure.

664,dogs,"I'm hoping to get a dog in the next few months &amp; have been looking at different breeds &amp; reputable breeders.  

This will be my first dog as an adult, but I had 2 shelter dogs growing up (lab &amp; lab/heelder mix).  I'm very drawn to herding breeds because of their intelligence &amp; energy.  I also like how glued they are to their owners while hiking, unlike retrievers and other sporting dogs which seem to run into the woods &amp; disturb wildlife while off leash.. 

I was initially super set on getting an Australian shepherd puppy, &amp; have even contacted reputable breeders &amp; reserved 1 that seems like the most laid-back of his litter.  The breeder has done all the genetic testing &amp; seems very good, but they're raised in a farm setting with 2-3 litters at once.   My dog will be living in a house with a big yard, 2 adults, &amp; 2 cats, so it's important to get a dog that would be happy in this setting.  I anticipate that I'll have 2-2.5 hours a day to devote to exercise, training, &amp; play on weekdays, &amp; more on weekends through hiking once the dog is an adult.  I'm not the MOST assertive person &amp; am prone to anxiety, so I'd have to really be diligent about being the leader with this type of dog, but I also know I can learn &amp; train the puppy to become a good companion for me through classes &amp; proper socialization.  

The reason my attention has shifted to ES &amp; shelties is for 2 reasons: 1. The ES breeder is much smaller-scale, but very reputable.  I feel like they'd do a better job of matching me with the best puppy from their litter, and that in the end the dog could be pretty similar to what I'd get in an Australian shepherd.  I understand that they're pretty similar to Aussies, but may be more prone to guarding tendencies &amp; I'd rather NOT have a dog that's hardwired to be excessively protective..  Since this will be my first herding breed, I'm also considering shelties since they're smaller &amp; would be easier to manage and train when dealing with things like reactivity towards dogs &amp; strangers.  I also hope to find a dog that won't be super intimidating towards guests, even during the training stages..  I know those behaviors are trainable, but my family would prefer a smaller dog &amp; perhaps smaller would be wise given these preferences?  They just seem a bit more timid around strangers than the Aussies I've met &amp; I find their bark more annoying (&amp; I know they bark A LOT).  But perhaps they're a smart choice for a first-time herding dog owner, &amp; I can grow to love their barks?  I'm also concerned that they won't do as well in a hot climate, but they'd also be more manageable to exercise indoors when its unbearable.. 

TL;DR :  Looking for a first dog, specifically a herding breed.  Was set on an Aussie, but am now looking at ES &amp; Shelties for other options.

Essentially the title. My bf and I have four dogs, and three of them adore kids. The last does not. 

As a bit of a backstory with him, we got him as a puppy from a shelter and he had a really sad backstory. He was starved and raised in a backyard before he was seized, and then he got parvo. When I met him, he crawled into my arms and burrowed into my neck for hours and I was completely smitten. 

He’s still like this with myself and my bf, and he’s a bit slow to trust with new adults, but eventually he warms up. 

Kids though, he has a horrible dislike for. 

We did get a trainer who helped us with him a lot for walks and things like that, but the problem is these techniques only helped while he’s on the leash. If a kid comes into our home, and he’s not on a leash, he growls at them, and slinks away, and then checks to see if they’re gone, and the cycle repeats. 

But here’s the thing: my bf and I do not have kids yet, and we don’t have many children that come over, and very infrequently. How do we get him used to kids if he doesn’t see them much?

670,dogs,"Yesterday my dog had what seemed to be sleep startle, but this is the first time it has happened in the year we have owned her. I was in the kitchen and my fiance was on the couch with her while she was sleeping. She apparently started dreaming and he went to pet her and she suddenly jumped up and snarled/barked and nipped my fiance's hand (didn't even leave a mark it was so light). I didn't witness most of this as I came running from the other room when I heard the barking. When I got there she was looking very apologetic and her tail was gently wagging but she quickly jumped off the couch and went to her crate on her own. 

I know of sleep startle and generally like to leave her alone while she's sleeping, but it's just strange she's never shown any other signs of having it before. We've never had to be extra careful around her or anything while she's sleeping, we just don't purposely wake her. The only thing I can think is that she is usually a light sleeper and wakes easily, so maybe this is genuinely the first time she was disturbed while sleeping that deeply. Basically I just want to see if others also think it sounds like sleep startle or if it's potentially another issue we should be looking into, not that I'm even sure what other issues it could be.

He has not been the same since his terminal cancer diagnosis three months ago. He is much more vocal, and I cannot leave the house without him barking. It isn't continuous, but it is a loud husky.  

I quit my old job to work from home so I could watch him more. I have not left him alone for more than an hour since his diagnosis 3 months ago.

When I first met her pup, he had a crush on me, liked the fact that a new guy in the house wasn't abusive or mean (he's 11 y/o and her father wasn't nice to him, so he's got a bad record with men.)

One day, as he continued warming up to me, me and my gf were spooning or cuddling on the bed, he was laying right next to us, specifically near my behind. What I'm about to tell you next is going to make you think this is a troll post, but I swear to you I'm dead serious. Thinking none of it at the time, I had to fart and it ended up being loud and resonant- immediately after this as he was near my rear, he ran off the bed and went to the corner of the room SHAKING as if I had traumatized him. 

It seems comical, but it also breaks my heart, ever since that day he anxiously looks at me, and immediately runs off whenever I'm in his vicinity. It has been 1.5 years since this happened, and he still hates me.

I understand Havanese are ""velcro-dogs"" and stick to one or two people usually, but I'm not looking for his deadset companionship, I just want him to trust me. I have tried treats, exercises, etc, nothing has worked.

What can I do to win my gf's Havanese trust? He used to lay with me and snuggle with me before I ripped ass, not thinking it'd literally traumatize him.

684,dogs,"Two factors to consider:
1. Aggressive dog is definitely meant to be outdoors more and has a lot of energy
2. Ag. dog is not spayed. She’s going to be three in March and we plan on getting her spayed before then. 
3. Ag. dog was our first and then the second came along a little while later so ag. dog established herself as the alpha pretty quickly.

I (24f) live in an apartment with my younger sister (17f). When our mom was living at the apartment she was the person to choose the breed. We have no idea why she would choose this particular breed (Texas Heeler) and we have never really known how to train her properly. She’s extremely smart but VERY spoiled and tries to assert her dominance with us as well. I myself am a cat person. I love the dogs ofc but I don’t know how to handle them like I do cats. Anyways, the two pups are primarily friendly towards each other and technically belong to my sister. She has invested in them both the best she can being that she is still pretty young but has a full time job and gives them adequate care. 

We think that this may be something to do with pent up energy since it’s been so cold and we haven’t been taking them to the park as frequently. We are at a total loss as to what to do. The attacks are completely unprompted and we are all on edge that ag. dog is going to SERIOUSLY injure our other dog (who is a total sweetheart and is literally the most chill dog I’ve ever seen). She definitely needs to be spayed but money has been so tight. Should we rehome her instead and not prolong this further?

686,dogs,"hi everyone. while i might not have a dog and i won’t for a pretty long time… i still want to ask yall this cause plans for the future are better made early on. so, im 18, my home situation isn’t good for my mental health (only mentally, there are no physical abuse) let’s leave it at that. i am currently in school and probably will be next schoolyear too. i have an income of €600 a month from the government since i have to pay for most things i need myself. it is rarely enough to come by especially  with food and gas are my most expensive..expenses. i plan on moving out as soon as i get the only job i actual want but right now they arent looking for new people  and once i have saves up a good amound of money. i have help from my moms, and some external help to figure out the expenses of living on my own. not to mention i am autistic, but i have evolved tons over the years and have become really independent. but its still a very huge thing especially at my age. i also have my drivers liscense and a car. 

now, my dream dog is a border collie. i know y’all probably saying its not a good idea to pick that breed as a first dog. however, i have a very special place for border collies in my heart, as we used to have one when i was a kid. i am afraid  and somehow convinced that i wouldn’t be able to connect with any other breed, except for aussie shepherds, since they kind of look alike and have the same traits. i have looked into aussies but like the lil version too. apparently they have a smaller kind. i have done alot of research on border collies when i was like 12. so this dream has been going on for like 6 years. i dont often research anymore since i get sad that maybe i will never be able to fulfill this dream. though id to anything to. also if it wasmt clear, none of my family wants a dog in their home so thats clearly out of the question. 

so finally here goes my question(s): may the time finally come, should i get a pup or an older dog (but not senior)? im thinking even though a pup is tough, it would allow me to gain alot of experience with dogs and training. however adult dogs are easier but they are more difficult to train to your wants and needs due to them already having developed their habits and stuff. since i want my dog to be well behaved and trained this is important. 

secondly, is a yard required for a border collie IF id go on long walks? im talking, for example.. before work 30 min, after 1 hour (probably more) and if i still have time maybe a bit more. and in the weekends like 2 hours atleast once a day but also small walks too. as i know these dogs need alot of exercise and i am determined to give them that. i am going to start going to the  gym, so that i can get fit again. nothing crazy just to regain my fitness that i used to have a couple of years ago and to lose weight. so by the time id have moved out which will have to be in 2-3 years, id probably be well on track with that. 

third, its obviously not cheap to own a dog. if any of you have a minimum wage job and also own a dog, how do you do it?

lastly, how do you manage dogs like border collies while youre at work? i imagine slot of peope witg these dogs dont work at home and still have a good bond and a happy dog. what do u do with them when at work? hire someone to walk them(also costs money tho)?, just let them loose in house with dog puzzles  or whatever thats called so they can be busy?, or do people with collies just not work away from home? seems unlikely to me but idk. 
im planning on doing part time tho, which is 5 hours a day only. id recieve around 1500€ and i probably get cheaper gas and electricity ect becase i have an official diagnosis for my disability (autism)",t2_eykkjhyh,0,moving out &amp; getting a dog,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,True,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zef7hb,True,quigonjjinn,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zef7hb/moving_out_getting_a_dog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zef7hb/moving_out_getting_a_dog/,2467561,1670354019,0,,False,1670354036,1670354037,2022-12-06 19:13:39,,,,,

I have been working from home for about half of the time we have had our 1.5 year old basset hound. He is a wonderful dog and does tons of the things right. But lately he has been begging a bit too unapologetically.

Is there a better way to communicate to him via some sort of training tactic such as positive reinforcement? Whenever he does get people food, it is in his own bowl when we are not eating.

700,dogs,"1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my second (own) dog. I currently have a two year old Shiba Inu. Enrolled him in puppy school.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Depends. The only reason for going with a breaded would be getting a puppy which means I get to spend time and bond with more.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Small to medium sized dog that does not require a lot of extensive exercise. Loving, loyal &amp; cuddly.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

No pugs or frenchies for health concerns.

Poodle mixes (I know), they’re cute and exhibit pretty much all the traits I want in a dog.

Aussie - my dream dog as they are gorgeous. Intelligent, humorous &amp; eager to please. Unfortunately, my current lifestyle is not fit to own one but hopefully one day.

Corgi - a good sized companion, easygoing and loves to cuddle. Although I have some health concerns.

Hokkaido inu - having some experience on the ins and outs of owning a spitz breed, I would say I would definitely be prepared to own one. Hokkaidos are similar to shibas in temperament but bigger, which I always wanted in a Shiba. 

Samoyed - cute little clouds. Don’t have much knowledge on their temperament but their shedding puts them low on my list.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic commands. Nothing too advanced.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

N/A

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work a 9-5 so when I get off I can spend time with my dog until bedtime at 12.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Daily 30 minute walk. Some backyard play. Trip to the park (regular) for an hour occasionally.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Willing to pay a professional for grooming once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium sized. 20-45 lbs.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding the less the better. As long as it’s not husky shedding, I don’t mind.

Barking and slobber does not bother me.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not so important but it is nice although I will never let me dogs off-leash no matter what.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly me up!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Friendliness but some protectiveness is appreciated.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Hopefully training and socialization will pay off. Since I have another dog and ideally they should get along, the answer would be no.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I want to avoid escape artists and I’m not talking about 1-3 escapes, but dogs who will bolt out the door at every opportunity or slip out of its collar during walks. Stubbornness (already have one, don’t need another hard head lol). 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

9-5 on weekdays but more often than not, I get off 1-2 hours early. Usually home for most of the day on weekends. Travel twice a year.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Currently live with family, they don’t partake in any dog care with an exception of taking dog to potty when I’m not home. Looking to move out to a small home with a yard or apartment in the future.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a male Shiba Inu.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

California. Not aware of banning of certain breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers go anywhere from 90-105 degrees and winters 40-60 degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

My Shiba male is leash-reactive and does not do well with other dogs entering his territory. Great with humans, ok with babies, and aloof with other dogs depending on the environment. No resource guarding. What breed would pair well with a Shiba?

702,dogs,"Might be the wrong place to post this sorry, I’m trying everywhere. Also this is England. 
 

We move house last Christmas and someone in the street who we had become friends with was getting evicted. We took him (ben ) and his dog(tess) in. We fed and gave Luke a roof for almost 2 months

He found a council house but couldn’t take the dog due to the size of the apartment and the building rules.

It’s been 4 months since we’ve had tess and we’ve grown to love her so much, she’s young. Not even a year old yet, I taught her to sit, I walked her (he didn’t), I taught her heel and roll… 

Now this Ben says he got the dog registered as a emotional support dog and is taking her back as she can now live with him( we didn’t have any warning he just said he was taking her ).

I tried looking into ownership laws because he was a horrible owner to her and it seems because our address wasn’t on tess’s microchip and we didn’t pay the insurance that I had no case of ownership.

So I done what I thought best and gave the dog back. I wanted to keep her as I know a dog under a year shouldn’t be switching owners so much, it will leave her fucked up plus I love her so much. 

I’m planning on calling bens parents (they won’t be happy, everyone thinks he’s a mess) I’m calling the flat he lives at to make sure he’s allowed a dog and I’m going to be calling the housing association to make sure they know as well. I know this may seem petty but honestly this is a hyper active dog being moved into a tiny flat with a owner that doesn’t walk her so I will do what ever I can to help her 

Please does anyone know anything that can get me this dog back, she was barking in the car when he took her, she doesn’t bark. What’s best for her is to stay with me, the family she has bonded with for the last 4-5 months.

Thankyou

706,dogs,"I have a male heeler, he’ll be one at the end of January. I got him about 6 months ago. Until then he lived in an outdoor kennel with about 8 other dogs. He’s not fixed yet he has an appointment around his birthday. That’s the soonest I could get with my vet. Anyways, I have to crate him when I leave for work. He is in the proper size crate.  If I leave him out he chews through the drywall and tears up the carpet and tile. I don’t want him eating pieces of it and getting sick.  But when I crate him without fail every day he pees and poops in it. And not just a little bit. It’s everywhere and he rolls in it. I have to fully bathe him daily which I know isn’t good for him.  And it’s also not good for him to sit in that while I’m at work. But I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried the not crating, doesn’t work for him. I’ve tried covering the crate, not covering. Adding more bedding inside, no bedding. Safe chew toys, frozen kongs with peanut butter. Leaving the tv on, turning it off. He’s not the only dog in the house but I don’t have this problem with the other two. But their company doesn’t help. I’ve tried crating them next to him, leaving them loose, removing them from where he can see.  I’ve tried getting up an hour and a half before work and exercising him to wear him out. As soon as I get home we’re outside letting him run, he has herding balls and we do a lot of focus training. He’s fantastic when I’m home. We’ve done obedience training. I’ve tried what the vet prescribed. I’ve tried calming supplements. It’s as soon as I leave. I can go back in ten minutes later and it’s everywhere. Which also prevents me from getting a dog walker because no one wants to get out a dog covered in that and bathe them before they walk them. I’ve tried doggy daycare, he didn’t do well and quite honestly it’s too expensive. When I’m home he’ll willingly go lay in his crate to nap, I feed him with the door open in it.

709,dogs,"This is my first Reddit post so please forgive any mistakes.  I am posting just to clear my head as to what is happening with my dog Sambuca. This might be a bit long but some stories deserve a bit of length.  Forgive any formatting errors, as I said, this is my first Reddit post.

 My wife and I have three rescue.  Sambuca we adopted eight years ago.  The other two were failed fosters that we simply couldn't give up after fostering them!  Sambuca is a German Shepherd - Mini Schnauzer mix (with a dash of a few other breeds as well).  We have had him since he was 6 months old.  He is my best friend, very athletic and absolutely full of personality.  He makes me smile each and every day. I would like to think I make him smile as well.  I melt when he looks into my eyes.  It is the purest form of love I can imagine.

So two and a half weeks ago we noticed he would no longer jump into the car and was hesitating when going up and down stairs.  No big deal we figured; he probably has a sore leg or something from one of the recent runs.  A couple days later he would not even go up the stairs.  We took him to the vet and they did some testing and we are told he may have a disc problem in his back.  They prescribed an anti-inflammatory and a pain killer for use as needed.  Flash forward a couple days and his condition has worsened to the point where he is not even using his rear left leg. He is not limping on it; he is dragging it.  I make another vet appointment and they take some x-rays and do some bloodwork.  The bloodwork is normal and the x-rays show nothing.  They tell us to continue with the NSAID and pain killers but they recommend seeing a neurologist as there is nothing further they can do.  The following day (Friday) , I call the nearby pet hospital to set up a neurologist appointment.  My wife and I talked about it and decided that a second opinion might also be a good idea so we take him to the ER and spend 4 hours there; which is fine.  He defecated in the car on the ride there so he is now showing bowel incontinence.  They examine him and agree that he needs a full neurological exam (including an MRI) and it is scheduled for Monday (yesterday).  The weekend passes and he continues to get worse.  By yesterday morning he can no longer stand up and cannot move either of his rear legs. My heart is breaking at this point and it is all I can do to keep it together.  Over the weekend I ordered a support harness to help hold him up when I take him outside.  I taught myself how to express his bladder as he was no longer urinating on his own.  

We get to the Neurologist's yesterday and they do the exam.  They schedule the MRI for that afternoon. The neurologist spoke with us and told us that the best case scenario is he has a disc compression issue caused by IVDD and surgery will alleviate the issue; however depending on the amount of nerve damage his recovery prognosis was only 50 - 50.  She would not know for sure however until the MRI was completed.  Sambuca would spend the night there regardless and she would call us with the MRI results.  

She calls us around 3:30 with the MRI results.  They found no disc compression issue.  The MRI showed several lesions on his spinal cord; likely spinal cancer or possibly myelitis.  We knew this was a possibility but had hoped that the compression problem would be the finding; the lesser of two evils I guess.  We were devastated.  The only way to be sure what it was was to do a spinal tap, which carries risks of it's own and she would only do that if we were going to go the chemo-therapy route if it was found to be cancer.  That was a HARD NO from my wife and I.  We would never put him through that.  

The alternative is to treat him with a strong regime of steroids to reduce the current inflammation. He will never recover.  Likely he will be paralyzed as the nerve damage is permanent; whether this is cancer or myelitis It is also likely it will return at some point.  We agreed to the steroid treatment in the moment.  He remains at the hospital for a couple more days and hopefully there will be some improvement.  We are are awaiting a call from the neurologist now; partially hopeful for good news; equally dreading bad news but after the whirlwind of emotion and information processing yesterday needing a clear conversation with her.

I'm beating myself up over this.  I; we, could not make the decision to euthanize him yesterday.  My wife and I had a tearful afternoon and evening; wondering if we are doing the right thing for him; debating if we made a selfish decision; generally just crying and trying to cope.  We agree that we don't care if he is paralyzed. He can still be mobile via a wheel chair and live out whatever time he has left happily.  My wife and I both work from home. If he can be happy, pain free and otherwise healthy, we are fine with doing whatever it takes to make that possible.  He has given us more than enough to justify whatever sacrifices or inconveniences his condition might cause us.  

If that isn't possible, and the life ahead of him is likely to be full of pain and constant medications that will make him weak or sickly, then we agree that we will do what is necessary on our terms.  It will be done in his own home, on his own bed, surrounded by his loved ones, and his favorite bone.  

Thanks for reading this and apologies if it is too long.  I just needed to ""talk"" to someone and clear my head.

TLDR;  In two weeks time, my dog went from being a happy, healthy athletic dog to being paralyzed and incontinent.  Trying to cope, my head is spinning and hoping he has some kind of future.  If not, dreading the alternative but we will do the right thing.",t2_uotgv5nl,0,My Best Friend Sambuca,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Emotional Support]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Emotional Support],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,9ac70b1a-e405-11ec-b6d8-0282928d087e,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#014980,zebsx5,True,Decidedly-Ambivalent,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zebsx5/my_best_friend_sambuca/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zebsx5/my_best_friend_sambuca/,2467495,1670345914,0,,False,1670345928,1670345928,2022-12-06 16:58:34,,,,,

716,dogs,"Hello Everyone, i have two male dogs, both leonberger, who have been showing slighlty negative turns in their eating behaviour,

Feeding Protocol:

1. Announce food and Send dogs to  respective bed
2. prepare food and bring it to their eating station (elevated bowls)
3. have them both sit and look at me and then have them go at it

Younger dog still struggles a little bit with initial waiting but goes to bed when he sees the food in my hands.

I always supervise feeding time

Dog A, 3 years old, has always been a slightly incosistent eater, where depending on his mood or the weather he might not finish the food right away, yesterday for example he didn't eat breakfast and only 60% of dinner, afterwards he just leaves the food in the bowl ( I take the bowl away after he leaves the room, he knows this). I consider him too skinny, but it is not too an abnormal extent, according to vet 2 months ago, who did not comment on his weight or body ( you can feel his ribs rather precisely, and the hip joints are also easy too feel, its not directly visible, but you can feel them to an extent i consider a little much, but maybe i am projecting as a more heavyset person) 

Recently he has been less interested in food than usual and puts up resistance when i tell him to go to his spot ( he will lay where he is already laying and not want to move, or go to another spot he likes instead) After goading and motivation he will move to bed in the end, although it has become more of a hassle. He has also started displaying dominance towards our younger dog, whenever he shows interest in his food whilst he is eating ( he does not care once he is done). The dominance includes looking at him until he submits, or giving a low verbal growl ( his warning growl) until he submits, he will sometimes then either continue eating or walk up to the puppy and sniff him.

Dog B, 7 months old, always a voracious eater, finishes his food very fast ( too fast even, but i make it all small and easy to swallow) has some patience problems( this does not concern me though, because I know how to work on this) has started growling a bit whilst eating, not consistenlty but will growl a little bit occasionally. He is always eager for food, but I consider that normal, seeing as he's a puppy. Im am a 100% he is not too fat or too thin.

Excercise: Both dogs get around 2 hours of fast walks a day and get to run freely on the property to play with each other and explore (4000m2)

718,dogs,"I’m sorry I have to vent here but seriously hear me out. 
I was on a walk with my 6 month old pup last night, everything was fine until I see something charging from a distance. An angry, snarling, barking staffy and no owner to be found. My first instinct was to use the umbrella I had as a shield or a border between him and my pup. I have no idea how to act in situations like these so if anyone could let me know I’d appreciate it. 
So I started screaming “go away, get your dog!” After fighting it off for a good 30 seconds, ruining my umbrella entirely, I hear the owner screaming the dogs name and standing and patting his knees for it to come back. No shit it didn’t come back. He wasn’t able to grab him the first time since the staffy had way more power than he did, mind you a 13 year old was walking this dog at 10pm. I don’t know what possessed me to be so polite but once he had control of his dog I asked him if his dog was fine. Face palm, I know. The area where we were in is a beautiful alleyway surrounded by trees and houses, our neighbourhood basically and they are very strict with dogs on leashes. There are signs everywhere hung by the town. After me telling this kid that there could be more dangerous situations and it could be his dog being attacked by an even more aggressive dog, I hope he understood. He however has the audacity to ask me “was my dog at leash friendly towards yours?” As if my answer determines if he is can continue to let the dog off the leash or not. God I hate people like this.

719,dogs,"Sorry if I used the wrong tag.

I don't really know anything about taking care of dogs as I am not a huge fan of them beyond giving them some cuddles when visiting people with dogs. 

But I live with my brother right now, who has two small dogs (male and female, not sure what breed). He's put the male in my bedroom to prevent him from trying to mate with the female. I assume I'm responsible for him until the female's heat ends, so probably a few weeks. I've had him for a few days now and it's stressful already.

I've got water in the room and there is some dry food but he hasn't eaten much. I've given the dog some meat from my own food in the meantime. Does he need wet food too?

The dog also seems to be anxious away from my brother so he's whining a lot, which I worry is hurting his throat because a lot of his whines now sound more like small coughs or something. I've tried cuddling him myself but he still whines for my brother half of the time. Sometimes he just gives up and lays in silence. How do I entertain him? 

Is there a way I can get him to not sleep in the bed with me? Or will I just have to deal with that since my brother always lets him and he's gotten into the habit? 

I've let him out a few times to pee but I don't think he's had a poop yet. Other than that, I haven't taken him out as I don't know if he has a leash at all. From what I'm aware, he's treated as an indoor dog? Is there an alternate way I can exercise him if he doesn't have a leash?

Also how often should dogs be groomed and bathed? He always feels greasy to me but it might just be a dog thing. He also doesn't seem to have any knots in his fur but he licks himself a lot.

No, not at all. Throughout the course of a day, a dog's nose will go through multiple cycles, from being moist and chilly to warm and dry. In the vast majority of cases, a **dry dog's nose** is just the way nature works. What, though, if any, cause for alarm exists?

While a dog's wet or dry nose is usually nothing to worry about, it may sometimes be an indicator of a more serious problem. The most common signs that a dog's dry nose is cause for concern are changes in behavior like lethargy, a low appetite, or vomiting. In all likelihood, there is no need for alarm if he seems as healthy as ever, but it is prudent to keep an eye on him anyway.

If you are aware of the underlying reason, treating a **dry dog's nose** is simple. To determine the underlying problem, take your dog to a qualified veterinarian.

*is it really just allergies and i’m overthinking? should i take her to the vet either way? what are the possible causes of this behavior?*

730,dogs,"Okay, so to preface, we (GF and I) live with my inlaws and their dogs , one of which is the birth mother of our dog, aswell as two more of her children.

Anyway, the female has gone into heat and all the guys are acting crazy. My dog has been distancing himself from us more and more over the past days. Usually he follows me around everywhere and never stops wanting to be with me, but now he only wants to lay beside her. Only if she's in the couch does he come to us and lay. 

He doesent hump her or anything, he just sniffs her and such. 

I am worried I might have messed up last night, we were in the bedroom, usually his birth mom sleeps with us, but this night she wanted to sleep with my dad in law and we thought it would be fine. But he kept on whining and whining infront of the door for hours and we tried to ignore him, call him into bed, cuddle with him, shush him both gently and in a stricter tone, nothing worked. 

At one point I got so frustrated I kind of yelled at him and placed my head to his, hands on his ears (not violentæy or anything) and told him to be quiet but I did in an aggressive tone. I immediately felt bad as I laid down, he crawled ontop of me and licked my face, and I said sorry and cuddled him. I didnt want to be that aggressive but I was so sleep deprived at that point. 

Today I feel so bad and guilt ridden and I am hoping he is distant because of the female in heat and not because of me losing my temper.

I gave him some cuddles and treats this morning as a way to say sorry, and he did take them, not with much enthusiasm as he didnt want to leave his moms side and has pretty much just laid there all day with her.

I feel so bad for what I did and wonder if I fucked up something permanently. It's not a thing I usually do, I was just so frustrated and in need of sleep.

He has basically been in the kennels for around 3/4 months(he’s just turned 6 months). I’m guessing that he’s behind compared to where other dogs should be at the moment. We keep telling him when he’s nipping but he then thinks it’s a game. His adult teeth are now coming in so it hurts when he nips sometimes. Same goes for when he’s chewing something he shouldn’t be. We have a chew stopper spray that does work but he will just move somewhere else to chew. We do crate him sometimes if he does something he shouldn’t be doing. 

He has learnt new things and his recall isn’t great as well as his pulling on the lead isn’t great. However he was such a timid dog when we got him and now he’s a lot more confident. He only learnt how to come downstairs yesterday, before we were having to carry him.

742,dogs,"Backstory. I rescued two greyhounds, bother and sister,  from the Daytona Racetrack back in 2015. The dogs are litter mates from the same litter. I have had both of them for about 7 years now. Neither is aggressive nor have there been any fights between them in all these years.

Today I returned from an outing and discovered the male had literally ripped the throat out of his female sister. The injured hound is currently undergoing emergency surgery to repair the neck wound which left the trachea and major blood vessels of the neck exposed. She also has major puncture wounds to her left thigh. To say the least, it was majorly traumatizing to me and to the female hound that was so grievously injured.

So I guess my question is, what happens now? I no longer trust the male hound involved. What if that had been a child? Or other human? Or a dog at the park? He displayed no aggression previously to other dogs or to humans. But proceeded to rip his sister's throat out nonetheless.

I can't have him in my house any longer as I do not trust him as far as I can throw him. Animal control is suggesting euthanasia, but since the attack was on one of my own dogs the decision is apparently up to me. But they did point out I am legally on the hook for any further damage done by him, to other dogs or to humans.

I obviously plan to keep the dogs separated when the injured one comes home, if she does. It's kind of iffy. By contract I can only return the hounds to the rescue I got them from, but they are not returning my calls. I know dogs have spats at times, a nip there, a snap here. Minor puncuture wounds, minor flesh wounds. But he literally ripped her throat out, resulting in major surgery.

What is the prudent course of action here? There is no legal requirement to put him down since he only attacked a dog and not a human (by my particular state laws) so they are leaving the call up to me.

I signed a contract that I cannot rehome either of them except to the agency I adopted them from. But they are not responding to calls. What the hell am I supposed to do?? I simply cannot have this hound in my house. I do not trust him and can barely stand to look at him, truth be told.",t2_4p8w7zbt,0,I don't know if this post is appropriate for this sub.

We have a 5 yo 70lbs husky mix who we adopted from a shelter when he was 3 (covid baby 🥳) who is very quiet and mellow. He’s honestly awesome for us, extremely chilled out but aware - like completely plopped in some spot for 4 hours with eyes open - but is frankly pretty lazy. We walk him 1-2 times per day and he loves hiking. 

A week ago he started limping a lot on his right hind leg in the evenings and after lying down for awhile. It maybe started on a beach run/walk but we’re not sure. After walking for a bit he gets over it. My partner and I are immediately worried he has arthritis or something. Any thoughts from you knowledgeable folks out there?

745,dogs,"Hello, Reddit. I'm new here and I was really hoping for some insight/advice. I'll try to provide as much information as possible. I hope that this post is not against community guidelines. 

My dog, D (he's really my father's dog but I take care of him 70% of the time now) is a 4 year old Airedale. About 3-4 days ago he was given a bone by my father, which is a normal occurrence, D has been eating bones for 2-ish years now with no issue. This time however it seemed he might've bitten off a larger piece and it got caught somewhere in his stomach/colon (I'm not too certain). He started to eat less food as the days went on, but had been drinking water, using the bathroom regularly, and is behaving pretty much as usual. The only difference is that he will sometimes hack a little bit, but it's not intense, more a mild huffed exhale. He is also breathing just fine.

I'd advised my father to not give him a second bone, but my father is almost 70 and a stubborn man, and about two days after the first one, D got another bone. He ate less of that one, and barely touched his breakfast or dinner (a kibble mix with added meat and vegetables. He gets a high quality brand that I purchased after having a vet recommend it). So today I decided to take him to the vet, hoping that they could tell me if he had a large piece of bone in him, or if he was just going to pass it naturally.

Only expecting the doctor to come back and tell me about the bone fragments, I was entirely blindsided when she instead brought up D having a heart condition, a combination of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. In essence, an arrhythmia. I was so stunned by this information I almost broke down entirely, shocked and terrified for D's health. They didn't even x-ray him because they were worried about putting too much stress on his heart. Instead they recommended me to another, larger clinic in my area and sent me on my way after explaining a little more about the condition itself. They also added that they were surprised to find he had the heart condition because he has shown zero symptoms aside from the irregular heartbeat. He isn't lethargic, has never fainted, this is his first emergency room visit, he'd been healthy his whole life. I take him on walks as well and aside from being a big boy, he's always been himself.

So, here is where I need help and advice from those who have had/currently have pets with the same condition. The animal hospital in my area told me that it would cost between 1-2.5k for all the treatment D needs. I'm not rich, I'm barely making it as it stands, my father is too old to work and has his own health conditions. I have a car that needs fixing and a house my family needs to move out of soon for reasons I don't have to get into here (long and short; no oven, one working toilet, leaking pipes, barely functioning shower, it's started to fall apart and landlord doesn't care). The point is this---I cannot afford that kind of treatment for D, I do not have disposable income like that. And even if I did, my father is vehement in not wanting vets poking and prodding at D and pumping him full of medicine. 

Again, I have to reiterate that my father is a very stubborn man and I want to respect his wishes as much as I can since D is ""his"" dog. Please do not suggest vets and medicine, as I cannot afford it, and my father doesn't want that, nor will he listen to me (although I agree in some capacity about not wanting to stress D out further by taking him to vets and having them do tons of things without really addressing the problem. at my local clinic I couldn't even be given a straight answer as to how this condition came about). Again, I'm sorry if I'm coming across as rude but please do not suggest these things.

I've spent all day researching what I can regarding natural foods/vitamins/etc. that I can give him to help with his arrhythmia and ease his irregular heartbeat. I plan on purchasing hawthorn and motherwort along with a bag of Royal Canin Early Cardiac dog food when I get paid again, along with a few vitamins and anything else I can afford. But I would love to (and need to) hear from actual pet owners who've tackled this with a more homeopathic/natural approach. 

What can I do for D? What other foods and vitamins and products can I buy to help with his heart condition? What exercise should I have him do, if any? body massages? Please tell me your stories and what worked/didn't work for you, please. Despite being my father's dog I love D with my whole entire heart and want to do what I can with what I have, while respecting my father's wishes. Understand that D still isn't showing symptoms and if he does start to get bad or his health takes a turn, I will be doing everything in my power to help him despite what my father might say.

I am just under a lot of mental and emotional stress and I will take every bit of advice anyone has for how to best help D without surgeries and expensive medications. I will also answer any and all questions to the best of my ability. Thank you so much in advance.

He definitely seemed overwhelmed and overstimulated by the new surroundings, but he was still himself. The dog-friendly building we're in was great for him, and he seemed to like walking around our new neighborhood, although he was constantly trying to pull and chase pigeons.

The last couple of weeks, it's been a different story entirely. Aside from an intermittent diarrhea issue that we've been to the vet about and they found nothing (related?) he's been maybe 20% of the time snarling and freaking out at other dogs in our building and neighborhood, an issue he never had before. Even more worrying, he's been resisting us on walks a lot more and even figured out how to wriggle out of his harness, which he's now done twice on the street. He mostly knows not to run into traffic but it's a heart attack every time.

And we were able to fix ALL OF THESE BEHAVIORS after months of blood sweat and tears. Now… he still is dominant with other dogs… and tries to hump other males. Which almost always leads to trouble. And an occasion where two large un neutered pit bulls  attacked each other and he jumped in. Scariest moment of my life. He just won’t stop the dominant behavior with other dogs.. I’m at my wits end.. and the reason I’m considering neutering is because I just got a baby pitbull. And the pitty has been perfect! He’s 100% in tact and has ZERO issues my mini OEB has. And the pitty is starting to pick up behaviors from the OEB… that’s the part that scares me. When I walk the pitty alone he’s perfect.  But when I walk him with his brother he won’t listen and acts dominant.. anyway…

Has anyone had experience with a dog that has dominance issues? I forgot to mention me OEB is obsessed with sniffing other dogs genitals too… has anyone had a similar issues with a dog, then had them neutered? And did it help with the dominance?

Also, I understand neutering doesn’t affect aggressive behavior. It’s not aggression I’m worried it’s his dominance tendencies.",t2_92yw5co1,0,Neuter dog yes or no,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zdpo9s,True,realproam,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zdpo9s/neuter_dog_yes_or_no/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zdpo9s/neuter_dog_yes_or_no/,2467303,1670286782,0,,False,1670286799,1670286800,2022-12-06 00:33:02,,True,,,
771,dogs,"I tend to feed my dog in a puzzle feeder (she has a slow feeder/anti gulp bowl with 3 knobbles in it as well) but some are too easy, and the harder ones she gives up with because they're harder and less rewarding.

I use her normal dry food (James Wellbeloved). A Kong Wobbler is a bit too easy as she just knocks it around the room so food dispenses quickly (not a back and forth wobble motion but moving it all around the room). Same with a kong Rewards Tennis ball and the Kong Stuff-a-ball. She has a Trixie snake which is a bit different. We also do a snuffle mat style feed in the garden.

She has a BusyBuddy ""Kibble Nibble"" which she gives up after about half her dinner because it doesn't throw out food regularly (I have not cut the rubber tabs down becuase I want it to challenge her). We've not yet tried the BusterCube with the middle insert in because I think it would frustrate her as she seems to prefer quick rewards.

Being a front amputee, I can't give her anything too paws-y as she can't easily scrap at things (like buttons, drawers to pull out, switches to flick). And being a fast eater, I daren't give her anything with removable sections (such as a feeder with bone shaped covers that lift off).

We took her to the vet and they gave us painkillers for it and said to come back if it doesn’t improve but couldn’t see much wrong and she wasn’t reacting to any pressure up/down the leg. Just to have her on short walks, no off lead.
A couple of days ago we took her back to the vets since her symptoms hadn’t improved. They sedated her, “poked around” and x-rayed, said they couldn’t find anything and it could just be dry pads so to moisturise.
Her limp seems a lot worse since then and unsure whether moisturising is doing anything. There’s no strange smell or sign of other skin irritation as far as I can see, it doesn’t look dissimilar from her other paws either in plain sight.

783,dogs,"Koa has been underweight her whole life. Her 1st birthday is Friday. She is in constant contact with her vet, who is more concerned about the Ca:Ph ratio of her food.

We have gone through 20 or so brands of food, and every animal protein imaginable (wet and dry food. She seems to dislike wet food).

She doesn't want her food. If I add minced cheddar cheese, or parm, I can con her into eating her dinner some of the time. Adding stuff to her food has allowed us to get her up to ideal weight for the first time (can't see ribs, but can feel them).

The new problem now is her anal glands. She scoots. She smells fishy sometimes. The vet took care of draining them. Less than a week later she's smelly and scooting again. Her poops are good, moist, and firm.

There is a lamb kibble for puppies that she chose to eat for more than 3 days straight, so it's the one bag I bought more than once. She's on her second bag of it, but won't eat it unless I put in treats like minced ham (no garlic or onion) and cheese.

She's still growing, and I'm relieved she is finally a good weight. But, her butt isn't thrilled with the chex mix. Ham and cheese are safe. Of course she gets sick of that too, and I've tried hard cheeses, dog food toppers, grass fed heavy cream (once).

I'm concerned about her health. I wouldn't feed a dog this sort of stuff. Her vet agrees that it isn't good, but calories are calories.


I could go on and on, but what have you tried in that past that worked to transition picky eaters? Taking the bowl away after 30 minutes, and she just won't eat for 3 days straight. ""sorry that's all there is"" isn't a useful tactic with her.

784,dogs,"5 year old black female Labrador Retriever. 

It’s been snowing here so people have been salting their sidewalks like crazy and unfortunately my dog seems to be susceptible to getting dry paws and the granulated salt doesn’t help much at all. Well after playing fetch with her today, I noticed whenever she walked on the snow there was a tiny amount of blood so I took her back in. She’s never bled before so this is a first for me. 

For context, I have hand eczema and there are superficial cuts allover both my hands and fingers so I’m always extra careful with hand washing after walking my dog or playing fetch with her and when saliva or any other fluid gets on my hands because it irritates them.

Anyways, we went home and I wanted to check on her paws and they did look a tad dry, but I didn’t see any cracks. I started to wipe her paws with a wipe and she’s usually very good at this and doesn’t mind, but this time it was obviously causing a bit of irritation and she didn’t like it all too much so she pawed me a couple times, gently, as a signal to stop I guess. Her slightly bloody paws came in contact with my eczema ridden hand. 

I’m quite OCD, so my question is if this would be of any concern to any dog owners here. She doesn’t have any blood borne illnesses that I’m aware of and she’s had all her shots.

795,dogs,"We recently got a minivan, which is great since I can now haul both dogs plus both kids in the same car without giving up the trunk space. Previously, the dogs had been using a back row hammock and the Kurgo harness attached to the seatbelts, which worked great. 

However, with the minivan captains chairs taken up by the kids with carseats, the dogs need to be in the back row of the minivan. I got just a regular bench seat cover, but they seem really uncomfortable without the barrier in front of them. I could attach the hammock to the back of the captains chairs, but at least one of them needs to slide forward and back so the dogs can get in/out and I can buckle them in. 

Is there another solution anyone has had success with? I'd like to avoid car crates, which would take up most of the trunk space, but I'd be open to a solution that involves folding the back seats flat as long as I still had storage space in addition to dog space.

802,dogs,"I don't really have anyone outside of our house to talk about this and I just wanted to share something heart wrenching that happened last night.

Almost one year ago, we got a beautiful German Shephard puppy. Working line, almost pure black. One of the most gorgeous dogs I've ever seen. His training was going very well and he is a complete sweetheart with everyone in our home. Really, he has a kinder, sweeter, and more affectionate demeanor than our golden. 

Yesterday was like any normal day until bedtime. I was lying in my 8 year old's bed waiting for him to come to read before we go to sleep. And when he hopped onto the bed, our GSD just... bolted in from the hallway, barked and lunged at my 8 year old. Bit him right on the leg and I had to pull him off. 

We've kept them separate since but my wife and I looked at each other right after it happened and we each knew what this meant. We have no choice but to return him to the breeder. We can't risk him going from 0-100 like that and hurting our son again. Luckily, he did not bite full force and barely broke skin, but he was not playing I'm the slightest. 

We're just so torn up as a family. Our child is sad that he got attacked AND that we have to get rid of one of our dogs. Even while he was crying and hurt he said he didn't want to get rid of him. But we have no choice. It's like we're losing our friend after not even a year. And he will have no idea why his family gave him away. 

Just a sad day here. We're all down and quiet. Not sure what to make of all this. I definitely recommend avoiding any aggressive breeds if your home has any children.

805,dogs,"Hi everyone!

I’ve noticed my one dog seems to hangout in one particular room quite often. I live with my family, there’s 5 of us in the house plus 2 dogs and a cat.

Our one dog is a Doberman. She is always with us, stuck to the family like glue. She also loves to be as warm as possible, constantly asking to me under blankets and cuddling up to us.

Our other dog is a Lab, Husky, Shepard mix (we think based on physical appearance and behaviour). She is also stuck to us like glue UNLESS she is in my room. She sleeps with me every night so she’s in my room quite often but even during the day sometimes she’ll slink away to my room. When I get home from work I’ll say hi to my family and then head down to my room to change and guess who’s on my bed? 
Unlike the Doberman, she gets overheated very quickly. She’ll ask to cuddle under the blankets and then quickly change her mind while panting on the floor LOL
She’s the happiest dog I’ve ever met. Loves everyone and everything, constantly jolly and unbelievably friendly.

However I can’t help but worry maybe she’s sad? You know how the happiest of people are often the saddest and they just give everyone else their happiest moments but then sit with their own sadness by themselves? I really hope that isn’t the case here with her.

My room is the coldest room in the house. It’s also pretty cozy I must say… but I don’t think dogs care how dim the lighting is and how pretty art and candles are.
Part of me thinks it may be because she seems to prefer cooler temperatures so she’ll hang out down in that room due to the temperature? Or maybe it’s because she sleeps there every night so it kind of resembles a den and it’s her comfort spot? I am not totally sure! 

So I was wondering, does anyone else’s pup have a favourite spot / room in the house they like to hangout in?

Me and my girlfriend (were in our mid 20s) recently applied to adopt a 1 year old labrador/Sheppard mix. He has been with us for about a week now and the trial phase is ending soon which means we have to decide if we want to keep the dog. Training has been going well so far and he is a smart and non agressive dog. 

He makes small steps towards leashwalking and already knows basic commands. However in the last few days he started growling at people in the hallway and is howling when we leave the appartment. 

We did a ton of research before deciding to adopt and have the time for good training and can afford a dog school or even a private trainer.

Even with this seemingly great prerequisites my girlfriend is overwhelmed by the task that lays ahead and is really scared of not being able to provide for the dog. This goes to the point of us thinking about not adopting him. She feels so pressured that she cant even enjoy the simple walks we take each day in fear of doing a grave mistake.

824,dogs,"Hi all, I adopted a dog about 6 weeks ago and within the past couple of days he’s started to bark a lot more. He seems to be barking at noises in the hallway (I live in an apartment complex). I read a few posts on here and have been trying to teach him the word “quiet” and giving him a treat after he is quiet for a few seconds. The noises in  the hallway happen all day long and they can be as simple as someone opening a door or walking past. Sometimes he ignores them, other times he jumps up and barks.  

Today he is barking at most of the noises. I wonder if I am incentivizing him to bark with the cheese? I don’t think he’s “faking it “ because he gets a piloerection and seems scared. I know on two occasions since he’s been here the maintenance people have come in and he was NOT happy. The first time I was home with him a few weeks ago and he would not stop barking. The second time was last Thursday, I was at work and he was in his crate. I know there was some kind of fire inspection. Friday and Saturday he seemed normal though, and Sunday afternoon he started barking at every hallway noise. I’m not really sure what to do as he’s not an agressive dog by any means, on walks he tries to go up to everyone, and I give him a long morning walk mixed with running to tire him out.

Right now he is sleeping, a few noises will make him put his head up and gruff, but he’s not done a big bark for at least 10 minutes. I don’t know what else I should be doing though. Can anyone offer advice? Should I take him to the vet given that it’s a sudden behavior change?

830,dogs," (Sorry in advance for the somewhat long post) 

My baby girl is a little over two years old. She is lab/German Shepherd mix.

Since she was a puppy, she had a very sensitive stomach. She definitely has a sensitivity to chicken; chicken makes her extremely sick. Therefore, we avoid chicken at all cost. 

We stuck to Blue Buffalo Wilderness with beef for the longest time, until recently. In early October (Currently in December) after an outing in the mountains she got extremely sick. We think she ate something she should not have. She had diarrhea and was extremely sore form one leg. We took her to the vet and after some x-rays they found out she has very advance arthritis for her age and hip dysplasia in her right leg. She got medication for the pain and inflammation, also, they recommended we change foods for something that targeted hip and joint. Thus, we swapped to Blue Buffalo with turkey (yes, a bird, bad move)

She did fine for about two weeks. Her leg pain eventually got better and no more diarrhea. Well, one day I got home from work and notice she had blood on her excrement (she had diarrhea again). I took her to the urgent care. She was severely dehydrated and had to be hospitalized overnight.  Thankfully she got better and came home to us after that night. 

The vet at this urgent care told us to stop giving her Blue Buffalo. The vet said something along the lines that Blue Buffalo was one of the foods that causes many issues they adress. We were given a list of foods to buy instead. A lot of these foods are way over our budget, except, Purina Pro Plan with Salmon. 

For a week after she was hospitalized, we fed her ground beef and rice (as per vet instructions) and then slowly introduced the new food. She has been eating kibble now for a little over a month. No issues until today. Not sure if it is the food that she is rejecting or she got into something she should not have. 

I need recommendations as in what to do. Should I switch back to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness? After all, I think she did best with that food. She did not get sick. Or find another food? She was prescribed Dasuquin and has been taking it since she got diagnosed with arthritis and hip dysplasia.  

I am at a lost, I want her to be healthy and it breaks my heart that she keeps getting sick. I don’t know what to do any more. Please help! And thank you!",t2_55ztimmt,0,"Help!

837,dogs,"We're currently having a very hard time with our senior beagle (13 years old) and would appreciate any insight folks here might have. Currently she is peeing every few minutes and tends to squat and go wherever she is at that moment. 

Over the past two years, she's started needing to go out more often (every 4 hours or so as opposed to being able to go a full work day) but with her age and us moving to WFH and being more available to run her out, neither we or our vet saw it as an issue. 

A few months back, she started asking to go out even more frequently in the evenings and had more frequent accidents in the house even when we were home. At the same time we were starting to leave the house more often following the lockdowns and found she had developed some separation anxiety (which was never an issue previously) and often came home to accidents.

Last Saturday is when the constant peeing started. Particularly in the morning she seems to squat wherever she is (furniture, rugs, hardwood) and pee small amounts every few minutes. When she is outside we notice she'll stay squatted for a good few minutes like she's trying to push out pee. 

She's been to the vet multiple times and has had a number of tests and there's no evidence of stones, inflammation, Cushing's, or UTI. The vet even gave her a shot of antibiotics on the off chance a UTI was just not showing up on tests. 

Nothing seems to be making a difference. Sometimes it seems like she's a bit better for an afternoon or a day and then she's right back to peeing constantly. 

The vet doesn't think it's incontinence and it doesn't happen when she's sleeping or resting (she'll always at least get up and squat a few feet away from where she was resting). 

Is it possible it's behavioural? She has always had stress accidents such as peeing when company is over, when we pack bags, or even peeing on the freshly made spare room bed knowing it means company.

845,dogs,"We had our rescue dog for 1 year this month (we got her on 12/26/21) and surprisingly she adapted really fast and well (the rescue did not have a history on her and she came from Korea). The only things we knew from the beginning was she had food insecurity (she ate so fast she would throw up) and someone must have hit her because she would cower if we raise our hands. The initial vet exam said she was relatively healthy, a bit skinny and she had a few bad teeth that would need to be taken out eventually. Fast forward to around June/July this year and her eating habits changed. She started refusing to eat her kibble, which we thought ok maybe her teeth was bothering her. The vet recommended adding broth/warm water to make it softer.  This worked for a little bit, the biggest factor that encouraged her to eat was our other dog who was older would try to eat from her bowl. Then August hit, and our older dog passed away and ever since it's been a daily struggle trying to get her to eat. We've changed up the kibble, added different flavor toppers, etc. She used to eat dinner no problem (for dinner we give her JustFoodforDogs), but these past two weeks she literally runs away whenever she sees the food bowl coming.  Throughout the day, she would lead me to where the treats are being kept, and during our meal times she would stare at us intently. But whenever it's her food, she refuses to eat. So far we only managed to coax her to eat if we give her a spoonful to lick/test and she sees us pour the food from her bowl into another plate/bowl (but it's almost like a human child, we have to grab her and put her in front of the bowl and really coax her to eat).

My 9 year old had a mass removed three weeks ago, along with getting neutered and having one tooth extracted. So he had already lost weight due to loss of appetite after surgery and only eating soft foods during recovery.

He’s had a cone to stop him from licking his leg, were the mass was removed. His staples were removed Saturday and Sunday they called me with the results of his mass biopsy, it’s cancer stage 2.

They recommended x rays asap and I agreed. They called me back immediately after hanging up to say he would need to fast for 48 hours before the xrays.

It’s so hard to watch him. I’m already devastated by the results, I’m hopeful the cancer hasn’t spread to his vital organs. 

He’s been lethargic. But has shown some appetite, and now it’s heartbreaking to not be able to feed him, while his brother eats. I fed my other boy outside, but he can tell and it’s sad because he doesn’t understand why I’m not feeding him. 

I thought of fasting with him to try and be supportive but I can’t since I’m breastfeeding and as it is my milk production is low.

849,dogs,"Looking for any tips, tricks, advice, and just all around help.

Issues with socialization, anxiety, and barking.

I don't think there's anything much to improve his anxiety given that all of our household is gone for six hours during the day for school or work. That combined with COVID lockdowns exacerbated his separation anxiety. However, the first year we had him he would go to the bathroom near each time we were gone for longer than two hours he has. So he has improved there, and maybe can. Is there anything else we can do to make it easier for him to be away from us?

Socialization is a big issue, but strangely not in the way you might think. He's not aggressive, but he does bark at other dogs. He enjoys it, and whines at us when we pull him away. I think for the most part he's not malicious or aggressive. The mixture of his breeds means he is independent, stubborn, single-minded, and follows his nose or instincts more than our commands. He's really only been mean when we were attacked by a dog, otherwise he's a goofball. To provide an example, when he met my friend's cat he kept sniffing him. When we interacts with a family members dog, he will either hump the bigger male dog with a smile on his face, or lick his fur and such constantly.

855,dogs,"I am looking for breed recommendations for our family. We had a English Pointer mix we adopted at 1.5 years old from WV for 13 years that passed in the summer of 2020. He was a good dog but could be very prey driven, was never great with recalls, and was not particularly interested in our kids. I am looking for a dog that would be more involved and play with our kids outside of looking for crumbs on the floor. 

The one hiccup is that my daughter has weirdly developed a fear of some dogs, in particular big dogs, since 2020. Our old dog was 65 lbs so it's surprising to me that she feels this way and not sure what triggered it. She just gets a bit nervous when first encountering a big dog but has really grown to like my cousin's Golden Retriever, but doesn't like the barking indoors. 

I would like to get a puppy from a breeder this time around and would really like an English lab. I think it would help that my daughter could grow up with it and would help her overcome this fear if she got it when it was a small puppy. She keeps saying she wants a ""small dog"" but loves videos of lab and golden puppies.  My 10 year old is also suffering from anxiety and I think a dog would really help him as well - he is ok with any size dog.

857,dogs,"     I have a 6 year old pit mix. I love her to death, but her eating non food items will be the death of herself and my wallet. She is currently admitted for what is likely a 5th foreign body, 2 prior ones have required surgery to remove. 

     My bathrooms doors are closed and the trash cans have lids. My kitchen trash can hides. Tissue paper goes up high such as on the mantle. I got rid of my houseplants. My cats have no toys and she only has the hard plastic material bones. No rawhide or cloth toys. She is crated when I’m not home (and sometimes when I am home but cannot watch her). She wears a muzzle at the advice of his vet to go outside in the yard because she tries to eat things she finds in the dirt. I don’t know what she got this time and I don’t know how I could possibly dog proof my house more. I have a baby coming next year and know JUST KNOW she is going to eat baby related things if I leave her alone With them even a second too long. I fear this is going to end with me giving her up and that will kill me, but will be what’s best for everybody.

861,dogs,"This requires a lot of backstory, so before I get into what recently happened I need to explain what lead up to this.

My mom has had a pitbull for years now, Charlie. We've had him since he was a puppy, though I haven't been directly involved in raising him since he was solely my mom's dog. A year ago, Charlie had a litter with a friend's dog and my mom kept one of those pitbulls whose name is Max. Again, I was not directly involved in raising him since he was solely my mom's dog. But my mom is... not the smartest individual, so she refrained on neutering Max which I think caused some form of aggression, or it might've been the fact she poorly trained him. He started attacking Charlie a lot, but due to stubbornness and idiocy my mom refused to get a professional to step in and help Max, or get rid of him. It was only when he ended up severely injuring a housemate of ours did she finally give him up.

But then that leaves Charlie. My mom, after we'd gotten rid of Max, had again done something stupid. She gifted me a dog named Milo, and even though I told her I hadn't wanted the dog because we needed to focus on making sure Charlie isn't traumatized from what happened, she didn't listen. Milo is a good dog, and under my supervision he's been behaving well and I've trained him a lot. He's my first dog, so I'm not doing the best but I've been trying with the tips I find online.

Now, here's what recently happened. Yesterday, Charlie attacked Milo. The fight left both of them injured, Milo more than Charlie because he's somewhat smaller than Charlie. When I confronted my mom about this and how this could've been prevented if she properly took care of Charlie, she yelled at me and said it was my fault for improperly training Milo when Charlie was the one who started the fight.

I don't know what to do. I can't afford veterinary bills so it's possible I'll have to surrender Milo even though I've learned to love him. But I don't want to keep him knowing my mom will continue to coddle Charlie's behavior and positively reinforce it because she treats him more like a baby and less like a dog. I can't move out either, it's not possible. My mom refuses to get a professional to train Charlie, so I could pay out of pocket to train her dog.

862,dogs,"My gf and I adopted a dog 3-4 weeks ago and he is still very scared of me but not her. I know he was given up to a shelter when he was around 1 and a half. He is 2 now. I can't help but think he was abused by a male which is why he is so scared of me. 

He was a VERY nervous dog to begin with. More nervous than any dog I've ever had. He is a dachshund mix. My gf is very short and I am 6'4.. which I think also is why he is scared of me. I've obviously not been mean to him at all, but even after 3 weeks he won't even walk on a leash with me or use entire fenced in back yard to go to the bathroom. Everytime my gf takes him out he will be (semi) excited and run around and go to the bathroom. When I take him.. he won't even leave the deck. Everytime I get near him he cowers or tries to scurry away like I'm going to hit him. 

Will this just take more time? It's a bit frustrating when sometimes he will jump up to me and let me pet him and then fall asleep on me, but when I go to take him outside he just freezes up.. literally. He will stand there and visibly shake.

I walk him during the day, and try to send him to daycare 1-2x a week as he loves playing with other dogs, and will also play with him when I can in between my work, but that doesn’t seem to be enough anymore. I also try to fetch with him to get him running in the backyard, but he’s not really interested in chasing toys/balls (which has been that way since we rescued him).

He does have separation anxiety, and I’m somewhat noticing when I try to get him to play with a toy, he tries to play with me instead, and I’m almost wondering if that’s the greater issue here. I am trying to work through his SA but it’s been slow so far.

We have a 16 month old female spayed Kangal/maremma and an almost 4 year old female spayed German shepherd. They have lived together for 14 months, both sleep indoors most nights. The GSD goes to work with my husband in an outdoor setting and let’s him know when large predators are around. Our Kangal stays within our yard (we own a quarter but she primarily roams our fenced 2.5 acre front yard) so where our chickens, cats and goats are. She is very good around all of those animals and we feel confident in her ability to protect them. Just this last few weeks she has been fighting viciously with our GSD. The first fight broke out over our GSD correcting her behaviour in the yard, the fight lasted 15 minutes until we finally were able to split them up. The rest of the fights have occurred in the house, one over treats even though they each had their own fed separately, the rest over the Kangal being given attention by us and the GSD walks into the room and the Kangal growls and things escalate. Last night we had visitors over which caused excitement and a fight started outside, the Kangal is getting better at fighting and instantly created a deep wound in our GSD’s chest.

871,dogs,"TLDR; Used to use a prong collar which was suggested by our trainer after months of training. I'd rather not use it based on what I've experienced and learnt but my dog, who has a hard temperament and extremely high prey drive to the point where high value treats are not a reward when we are outside. How do I positively reinforce loose leash walking?

  
My wife and I got our first dog, who is a rescue, 1.5 years ago, he is now roughly 2.5. He is a 40lb super mutt (mix of Australian Cattle, American Pitbull Terrier, Lab, German Shepard). He is such a good loving boy. When we first got him we hired an in-home trainer from Canine Dimensions. Given that he is smart and food driven, he did really well in training. When it came to loose leash training however we could not make any real progress with the trainer even with the most high value treat we can find, cheese. He does not care for *any* treats at all when we are outside and he becomes an extreme puller. It is as if the reward of sniffing out squirrels and being outdoors trumps getting a treat from us. There was no way to positively reinforce him outside when the treat doesn't even mean anything to him. Given that he also has a hard temperament, after months of trying to train him with no real progress, our trainer ultimately suggested a prong collar, while training us how to properly use it and that worked right away. We were a bit concerned at first because with the trainer, we were training him without any negative reinforcement. The trainer assured us that the prong he was giving us simply simulates a correction that other dogs do to each other if one of them wants to communicate to the other to stop what they are doing. 

Now after reading up a bit more on it and getting aggressive comments on the street from strangers I feel guilty and do not know what to do. I  have stopped using his prong collar and instead started using a martingale collar while using high value treats to try and reinforce him walking by my side but to no avail.

888,dogs,"**TLDR IS AT THE BOTTOM **
I moved in with my boyfriend about a year ago with my two young children. This is gonna make me sound horrible probably but i don’t trust his dog. He’s very kind , a bit hyper active but doesn’t intentionally hurt anyone (just scratches if he jumps on you or knocks child over jumping trying to play or excited to see them) but he just has this look in his eyes sometimes. I really can’t explain it . For example if he jumps half way on my lap(his bottom half in floor ) he slowly crawls his paws up to my face very slowly and licks his lips in what seems a submissive or friendly way and gets right in my face with his ears back while I pet him but he just has this look in his eyes that I don’t like . I may be over thinking it because I always said I would never have a dog with my children because I’ve seen dogs snap out of no where and seriously hurt people(granted 90% of the ones i personally know had medical issues which caused the change in behavior , but also there is some I personally knew that were super friendly dogs and just started being aggressive out of nowhere with no medical or logical reason behind it) am I reading into this too much and being over protective? I never leave my children alone with him ever and don’t even let them play in the back yard together anymore because he’s too rough and will full fledge run and knock them over on purpose .

My girls are Nora (2.5 yr black lab) and Goose (2.5 yr cat). They are treasures for all they put up with from me (I'm sure my frequently irregular sleep schedule and the effects of severe depression are a joy for them to deal with 😂), but don't think they don't give me sass back! Goose used to yell at me to go to bed, mainly because it meant her last meal, but has stopped since I've added more (I feed ~5 times a day, of course just smaller portions; I have both girls down to the calorie haha). If I go to bed this late, I also feed Nora half her breakfast, although she has never demanded food in the mornings! In fact, she'll keep me in bed just to cuddle which is so heartwarming because she 💕LOVES💕 food, haven't found something she won't enthusiastically try (weirdest to date: pickled ginger). 

This is the 5th or 6th night I've gone to bed around 5am in the last month, but I'm starting to worry it may end up affecting my 2 girls. I doubt this will ever become consistent past a few nights, a week if I'm lucky, but still wonder if the inconsistency is an issue. They won't go to bed without me, sweet but just go gremlins, so instead hang out in their usual daytime spots. Goose is like velcro during the day (for some reason she goes into terrorist mode at night, she also doesn't sleep with me 😂) and will be right there for every movement either judging, yelling, or occasionally being hella sweet. I know cats just sleep so much and fairly randomly anyways, so not really worried for her. But dogs normally need routines, although Nora has always been the most ~go with the flow~ dog, but doesn't mean her body may not be feeling effects.

My dog (Piper) is 18 (turning 19 soon) and I'm going to be honest hasn't been to the vet in a long long time. I asked my parents if we could take her several times but they've said that she's in such bad condition that they'll either take her away or put her down, I've been a bit skeptical of this but there wasn't much I can do as I had no money or way to get Piper to the vet for a check up. As of late, I got myself a job and have been able to reason with my mom about important topics so I feel I can convince her to help get my friend a check up for the problems she has.

I have no experience with this sort of stuff at all and Im still worried about what my parent said about the vet taking away my dog, so I might ramble a bit but I'll try to make it easy to understand

My main questions are:
· What can I expect for costs?
· What would I look for when trying to find the right appointment and vet?
· Can the vet take away my dog

Piper's Issues:
· Coughing like a goose and gagging
· Teeth are a mess

She is able to walk around without any issue and I see her run around from time to time, so she is pretty spry for her age. But I worry about her when she goes into a coughing fit, it happens a few times everyday and all I do is bring her to her water.

903,dogs,"heres the background: i 19f am a sophomore in college and live with my parents and our 3 dogs. the youngest is my mom’s small dog, C, that everyone but my mom hates. the oldest, A, is very old and will likely die within the year. the middle child has extreme anxiety. B is a rescue and shakes when meeting strangers, and shuts down on unfamiliar walks. this being said, dog A and i are her sole comforts in this cruel world, and i adore her to no end. (note: i think about these girls every day of my life. my parents have a time limit for how long i can talk about them.)

onto the actual post. i am worried about B’s behavior when i move out to go to college next year. she will not have A or myself. she is an anxious chewer and has severe separation anxiety. i have asked my parents if they would consider getting another dog, and they said not until several months after A passes. trust me, i pushed and they are not budging. i also asked jokingly if i could take B with me, and my dad said it would leave him with no dogs. 

i will be moving to the suburbs off a big city, and will be a full-time junior in college. i will likely live in a house with roommates or an apartment. B is a 60 lb boxer. i also will be a full-time student. but again, i live and breathe for these guys, and the idea of being dogless is really painful. my parents seemed a bit miffed that i would even think to ask to bring B to college with me.

904,dogs,"I keep hearing this thrown around, and I suppose it can be true… depending on how you interpret it.

Dogs need enrichment, but that doesn’t necessarily need to be in the form of a “useful” task, and conversely, just because something is “useful” to us, doesn’t necessarily mean that the dog’s needs will be fulfilled by it.

For example, a nice long decompression walk could hardly be considered a “job,” yet it’s a pretty good way to meet the needs of most dogs. On the other hand, bringing the newspaper once a day, would be a “useful” job for the dog to do, but it could hardly be expected to be enough to satisfy a dog’s needs. 

So I’m just curious where this phrase originated, because a lot of the time, such sayings did make sense in the context they were first said in, but were then distorted and taken out of context by people who repeated it without truly understanding what was meant by it.

Another example of this would be the advice to “just ignore unwanted behavior,” which makes no sense on its own, and will never be an effective training strategy on its own. What people often don’t realize though, is that it is a valid answer to the question of “what to do if the dog makes a mistake” during an errorless learning session. Because you DON’T want to draw attention to it, so you don’t want to correct the dog for it. It’s just that you then need to follow it up by changing the antecedents in order to prevent the mistake from reoccurring. (Or take a break entirely, because mistakes can also be caused by a dog becoming tired/running out of focus.) If you just pretend the mistake didn’t happen at all, and repeat things the same way you were doing, the mistake will likely also be repeated.",t2_5xrvlvpq,0,Anyone know where the idea comes from that dogs “need a job” in order to be calm/happy?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Discussion]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,discussion,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Discussion],1,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,fb1810c0-1bae-11e6-9be2-0e86681a83eb,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#326599,zd06fw,True,ActiveAnimals,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zd06fw/anyone_know_where_the_idea_comes_from_that_dogs/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zd06fw/anyone_know_where_the_idea_comes_from_that_dogs/,2467085,1670225035,0,,False,1670225045,1670225046,2022-12-05 07:23:55,,,,,

909,dogs,"This dog has contributed to us nearly being divorced. I didn't trust her around my dog, because she would continually attack her. I wasn't really sure who the aggressor was, but I left because of a lot of reasons, not just that fucking dog. However, we can't enjoy our lives together. We can't go on vacation. We can't go out too late - she might attack my dog in frustration. We can't have guests.

I've been at my families home with my parent's dogs for the last month, and ""my"" dog has had zero issues with fights. She goes to the beach and plays with strange dogs. She gets along with strange people. She is protective in a normal sense - when strange people get close to me on the beach, she puts herself between me and them and looks to me for guidance. The most vocal she's been was a strange man shaking my hand and causing her to bark.

She has been attacked multiple times by my husband's dog. My husband's dog is aggressive with children. She is aggressive with strangers, and she has nearly busted out windows trying to get to people who are knocking door to door. She has bitten me over food. She has done the same to my husband. There is absolutely no way to leave her in someone else's care.

They grew up in the same household. I just don't understand the disconnect in the aggression. I can't afford to sink the $4k in training that ""might"" work for her quoted to us. And I refuse to return to the US and subject my dog to what the other does to her. 

I'm still heartbroken. She is so smart, and so loving to people she trusts. She is more loyal than any dog I've ever owned. Right at your hip ready to go. I have no doubt she would kill or die for us, but she also makes impossible for us to live our lives. I have no idea what kind of person would even take a dog who can't get along with strangers, children, or other dogs.

910,dogs,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not exactly but close. I had a Greyhound for a month earlier this year who turned out to be unable to cope with being an only dog (He found another home soon after and is doing great, by the way). So I have that month of solo dog ownership that was jam-packed with all the surprises that an anxious dog brings. Other than that, my family always had a dog growing up, and when I was in college I watched a Masterclass on dog training and gave some basic obedience training to my parents' Mini Goldendoodle.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I much prefer adopting, both for cost reasons and the number of dogs that need homes.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog is like a Greyhound. A companion dog who is comfortable just hanging out around me and cuddling. They're smart enough to take to obedience training, as well as a few fun tricks. I also would like a dog that can recognize when I'm stressed or sad or whatever and provide support.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Like I've said, I already know I like Greyhounds. If I could adopt another one today I would. I am back on the list to get another one from the adoption agency, but I originally decided to get a dog when I moved out and started living alone. I moved out in August and was really hoping to have a dog by now. I'm not being impatient, but I wanted to just get my feelers out to see if there's any similarly amazing dogs I'm overlooking. So if that's other sighthounds, or just other dogs that are lower energy and don't need a yard, who are super friendly and don't need excessive grooming.


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Mainly the basics. Sit, stay, come, leash etiquette, crate training. I would also want to be able to establish boundaries and have the dog understand. I can't have the dog jumping into my bed without being invited, for example. As a bonus, fun tricks to keep them mentally stimulated and entertain friends wouldn't hurt.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not at all

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Whenever I'm home, which is most of the day. I leave my apartment for at most 4 hours at a time, but mostly work from home so I'd always be sitting next to, cuddling, playing, or training the dog depending on how much I need to focus on whatever else I'm doing, if I'm doing something else.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I can reasonably have an hour of walks divvied up throughout the day. I also have a dog park that's a 10 minute drive away that I would want to go to maybe a couple times a week depending on the weather.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I really like the low maintenence short coat of a Greyhound. I don't mind brushing every day, but I'm not willing to do haircuts on my own, I don't have a tub for a bath, and I can't afford super regular professional grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large. Substantial for cuddling but not necessarily huge. A greyhound is as big as I'd probably go and only because they don't actually weigh that much. I need to feel confident I can lift the dog in an emergency so no more than ~80 lbs.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Medium shedding, medium barking (I live in an apartment, but my neighbors dogs all bark from time to time. I still get a bit annoyed by it when it goes on for a while though), preferably little to no slobber but I think I could deal with it for the right dog.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not at all. I wouldn't ever trust it.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly, but will respect boudaries such as not sleeping in my bed at night, and getting off the furniture if guests need room.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Probably somewhere in the middle. I can't always devote all of my attention to entertaining a dog, even though I am home most of the time. A good learner yes, but also happy to just chill out a lot of the time.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Friendly, I don't want a guard dog. I want my friends to be able to come over and have the dog be happy to meet them.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. I need to have the option to take it to doggy daycare or stay with my parents' dog if I need to leave town for a few days.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not that I can think of.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Most weekdays, for about 1-4 hours at a time, for a total of 6 hours max maybe one day a week.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent, but there are no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Not that I know of.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are hot, can get up to the high 90s at the peak, probably lingers around 80. Cold winters, can get down the negatives often. Midwest if that helps.

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

912,dogs,"Thanks in advance for any insight. I had a DNA test done on my rescue. Her looks are such a mystery to me that I couldn't resist. (Not mentioning the company, since I don't know if allowed here.)

Results came back ""Eastern European Village Dog."" That's it. I think it is accurate, since geographically this is precisely where she's from. However, this was the mother's lineage. There were no results from the father's side, because they didn't have the ""paternal haplotype."" I understood this to be, no Y chromosome, so we can't tell you anything about the dad. I got in touch with the company, and inquired whether this was the case for female dogs, i.e. only 1/2 the result. Their response was just as confusing.   


So basically if you do a DNA test on a female dog, you only get the mother's side? And by extension, is this the same for DNA tests on human females, too? I don't know why I didn't know this, but it makes complete sense. I'm a woman and if I got one, I'd only get my mom's side, and not my dad's (but if I had a brother, which I don't, we'd be able to access paternal lineage from him.) I think?   


Anyway, I don't regret having the test done, but no questions have been answered LOL my pup is a small, floofy, white little thing that looks part terrier, American Eskimo, Poodle, Bichon all rolled into one, I just cannot tell.

My dog is an amazing dog, and loves people- no surprise. I usually take her on hikes, and we go to my city golf course every single day. Now that the weather is cold, and there are few golfers, she can run around off-leash. Most people in the neighborhood have their dogs off-leash on this course year-round, for reference.

Anyway, she loves running around, and loves rolling around on walks, and greeting people. But she won't ever play with toys, or fetch something if you throw it.

924,dogs,"So the title. A year ago our 4yo pomski came inside acting strange, crying and squatting low on the ground like she's in pain with all of her muscles tensed, especially back and belly. Kinda standing on only 3 legs but switching which paws she was standing on. However, she was also wagging her tail very enthusiastically and seeking our attention, sometimes ears up, sometimes down. Kind of typical excited behavior. These episodes lasted a minute or two and then stopped for 30-60 minutes while she acted completely normal. After a few hours of this, thinking intestinal issues, we took her to the ER vet the first time since it was the middle of the night. They did blood labs and xrays, found nothing wrong, slightly low potassium but nothing they were concerned about. Sent us home with pain pills we never gave her and she returned to normal by the morning. Her stools and bathroom activities were all normal leading up to and after this event. Then she was her happy and healthy self for a year without issues  
  
Well tonight she started again, exactly the same. We're going to take her to the vet in the morning but has anyone seen anything similar?

A lot has changed since March when I got her. I changed jobs, I lost my car. We moved into a significantly smaller place. The apartment complex I live in right now has a lot of people who don’t leash their dogs and mine has been attacked multiple times- she’s absolutely terrified of going outside and has been increasingly leash reactive even through almost 1,000$ worth the training. 

Even her crate training has regressed. She’s ripped up her tray and torn multiple sizeable holes (one of them is five inches wide) in the carpet which is about to put us down another grand or more. I don’t have enough of a life outside of work to re-train her.

It's been an absolute shit show since I got him.
He has separation anxiety and I've worked really hard trying to sort his issues. It took months.
About a week ago something triggered him again and we are back to square one maybe even further back.
I cant leave the house without him wrecking everything, I can't even go to bed without him crying. In the last week I have spent 4 nights sleeping on the floor or on the stairs so that he stops crying and my partner can get some sleep before work.
I cant sleep in the same room as the dog because that just makes things worse and then he thinks he needs to be with me ALL THE TIME. 
I'm tired.

I even tried to find him another home as I thought maybe someone out there could give him the life he needs. Not a single person interested due to his issues. I understand why he was abandoned in the first place...
I've spent so much money on replacing things he destroyed, on professional training that did fuck all,  on medication that is supposed to calm him down, nothing works. I hate this dog, it's creating a wedge between me and my partner. Draining me of all my energy as well as my bank account.

Dog A has terrible separation anxiety when we take B outside to potty, even if another human is in the house. We don't yet have a fence but plan to have one set up soon. So we have to walk them out there separately. We can't take them out at the same time as they are too wild and may slip out of their leashes while pulling/playing together.

We always take B out first since he's younger and more likely to have a potty accident. (Until recently??)

However, recently A's anxiety has gotten worse. She has torn down blinds, and pottied in the house as she freaks out about B being outside. A whines and barks incessantly. B is nearly always within view out the windows. 

I'm not sure what to do. A won't accept any treats or bones or any consoling. She's just constantly barking and has begun to potty inside more often.

I'm worried about kenneling A during potty time because she has pooped in her kennel when I took B to the vet once. And dragged the poopy kennel towards the door....

942,dogs,"I am a dog owner of 6 dobermans', I have nothing against ear cropping &amp; tail docking nor getting your dog spayed or neutered. Most people who are against ear cropping &amp; tail docking, their biggest argument is that it is inhumane and unnecessary. Saying that clipping part of the ear and tail off is not needed and the dog 'wants' their ears and tail. It's a human want, which is correct. I've even heard some say that dogs lose personality after the procedure which from personal experience, this isn't true.

My biggest problem with this is that you could say the same about spaying/neutering your dog. Not only is it an unnecessary surgery that comes from human want. It's overall more invasive. The life purpose of a dog is to procreate, and we take that away from them. A male dog who is not neutered is more prone to being aggressive, marking/being territorial, and being destructive to furniture like digging, chewing, and scratching. An unspayed female dog are also more prone to being aggressive and showing guarding behavior when in heat as well as bleeding. Obviously, these are undesirable traits that an owner would understandably not want in their dog. Therefore even more reason to spay/neuter them. 

Although s/n your dog can reduce the risk of prostate and cancer problems such as testicular cancer and uterine cancer it opens up the increased risk for several different health concerns such as osteosarcoma (bone cancer) , increased risks for hypothyroidism, cognitive impairments, and orthopedic disorders such as cruciate ligament tears, dysplasia of hips &amp; elbows, and arthritis.

I find that disliking one and liking the other is hypocritical. Spaying and neutering your dog has become so socially acceptable. No one considers the fact that getting your dog spayed/neutered is just as much mutilation as ear cropping and tail docking is, if not more. Along with the ironic fact that uncropped ears and tails are called the 'natural look' but floppy ears come from a process of inbreeding which was used to manipulate desirable traits and magnify them in offspring. When people are getting their dog s/n they aren't thinking about cons and aren't really made aware of them because it's so widely accepted and normalized.

I live in a rural, depressed area. Honestly, I thought the trailer next door to our house was condemned when we moved in but the lady came over for her mail one day--she mentioned she just got out of jail on a meth charge and her kids were taken away by CPS. She seemed okay/non-threatening, and we both keep to ourselves.

A couple weeks ago she got an adult pit bull that stays out on a chain 24/7. I admit, I'm terrified of pitts, even though they say they're sweet if they're raised right. I can be open minded, but this doesn't seem like a ""raised right"" situation.

I have small children and I'm terrified every time we go outside the dog will get off it's chain and someone will get seriously hurt. I have no evidence this is a dangerous dog, I'm just afraid. We don't have a fence (can't afford one right now) and the dog is behind a small section of privacy fence (but not fenced in) so I can't observe the dog regularly. Whenever it hears us it barks. That's all I know about it. 

She had one before this for a month or so that I wasn't afraid of cause it just laid around all day and wagged it's tail whenever it did see me and didn't mean-bark. It got off the chain though and ran away so I'm not confident about the setup being secure.

1. Reassurance it'll probably be fine?
2. Anything we can do to be safe?

!! **WARNING** for mentions of **animal maltreatment** !!

My family has been helping ""care"" for a dog that should never have been adopted by his current ""owner"" in the first place. The ""owner"" is a sibling of mine's significant other. But the significant other has two jobs and is not at his place practically all day, every day. 

""Care"" is used in quotations because, well... the treatment he gets is neglect at its best, abuse at its worst. No one here should ever be allowed within 5 miles of a puppy, honestly. They are quick to anger and have no skills in emotional regulation, so that anger typically turns into aggression and screaming.

We already have a dog (he was treated a little better than this, but honestly not by much. However he turned out okay, albeit anxious), and our dog and this dog have been getting rough with each other very often. This wouldn't be that much of a problem since it's definitely not meant to be aggressive, but our dog is anxious, as stated before, and *will* get a bit aggressive to defend himself since the other dog definitely goes a bit too far in the playing. This escalates and suddenly multiple people are screaming at the dogs to stop and it's getting unbearable. My cat who is my very best friend is also scared to leave my room because of this other dog. It hurts to see ALL of this.

I have been a witness to animal maltreatment since I was very young, from severe neglect to unprovoked physical abuse. I have (C-)PTSD from living in this house, and having to go through this again is *not an option* now that I have power as a legal adult. I'm constantly on edge, am physically sore from my body's instinctual response to go rigid and collapse in on itself at every sudden scream, and am getting sent into frequent emotional flashbacks.

The dog is a pitbull of 1 and half years old. He hasn't been neutered since from what I've gathered it seems like his life before all this wasn't very great either. He needs someone with actual experience and time, in a home that isn't as chaotic as this one.

I have very little power in this house. If you can connect the dots yourself, you can see that. I won't be explaining since this is too long already and that's also very off topic lol. I don't have a license and live in the US in a place with no reliable public transport other than Uber and other services like that. That being said, I do have the money available to use those services. So if I need to use them in helping this dog, I will 100% do that.

What can I do to get this dog a better home and owner? What services are available that won't harm the dog any more than he already had been? Are shelters an option? Is there some service I can call that *ethically* deals with situations like these? If you can simply point me in a direction, I will gladly do my own research!

If this is not the correct sub for a question/situation like this, kindly tell me the right one and I will take this there!",t2_ej7xqvh,0,"This dog needs a much better home, but I don't know what I can do to help accomplish this.","[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Misc Help]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,help,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Misc Help],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,023c4da8-1baf-11e6-a4b9-0eecc761c039,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#0aa18f,zcp7mj,True,antarcticshark,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zcp7mj/this_dog_needs_a_much_better_home_but_i_dont_know/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zcp7mj/this_dog_needs_a_much_better_home_but_i_dont_know/,2466955,1670195745,0,,False,1670195763,1670195764,2022-12-04 23:15:45,,,,,

957,dogs,"We've had our dog, a male Australian shepherd, for a little over 2 years now. Since he was about a year old (probably) he's had some issues with excessive barking, growling at us for stuff that should be inconsequential, and even biting me and some other family members several times. There was also an incident with a neighbor's daughter, but I don't remember if she got bitten or just snapped at, the dog had gotten out of the house somehow.

My brother and sister initially wanted the dog, but after the dog growled at my brother several times and eventually bit him, he stopped helping take care of it. I never wanted a dog, and said as much, so I've never been involved in caring for the dog in any significant way. I don't know if that makes me biased against him or not. My mom is a single parent, so my sister (14F now) ended up taking care of the dog, as a result, he seems to like or has bonded with her the most; this has started to change recently.

 A behaviorist has looked at him, and she strongly recommended that we put him down, calling him a one-in-a-million case. Based on what she said, he's probably genetically predisposed to anxiety, and that makes him lash out aggressively at the slightest provocation.

The only paths other than euthanasia which could (she said it would be unlikely) make the dog 'safe' for our household  are medication, which my mom strongly opposes due to her beliefs about medications in general (which includes the COVID vaccine, btw.. ugh) as well as financial costs, and professional training, which is also financially difficult.

On the day of, me and my sibling all agreed that the dog should go, but my mom didn't, so we all just went home with him and nothing has really changed. Now, after the whole lockdown thing ended, my sister has made a lot of friends, and as a high schooler she wants to go out with her friends and have time to herself. I don't disagree with that. But this has led to some conflict between her and our mom, because she simply isn't devoting the right amount of time to the dog.

As for why I'm not helping, he's bitten me twice. I have no interest in spending any more time with him than I need to, and considering my prior agreement with everyone else that I don't need to take care of the dog, I don't think it's an issue.

My mom has reached out to a bunch of organizations, including one that specializes in Aussie rescue, but none of them would take him because of his history of biting people. They did refer her to a trainer, but she never contacted him after the initial meeting because his rates are too high.

She told me that she's keeping him for her own peace of mind, but that doesn't change the fact that me and my siblings still have to live in a house with him. There haven't been any incidents recently, and I think that's because none of us besides my sister have even attempted to play with or engage with the dog. I stopped because the last time I played with him, he bit my hand. It wasn't life-threatening, but it definitely wasn't just a scratch either. 

Does anyone have any advice for what to do in a situation like this? My personal opinion is that the dog should go (which means he dies since no one will rehome him), but that's not an option so I'm open to other suggestions.",t2_78nw0vpj,0,My aussie has anxiety/aggression(?) issues,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '[Behavior]'}]",r/dogs,False,6,,,,True,False,light,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},[Behavior],1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,richtext,6,,text,self.dogs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,,[],[],False,b9512f20-e405-11ec-a1a6-06b9e2ab99c6,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qhhk,#7193ff,zcp2qy,True,I_Eat_Very_Few_Souls,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/dogs/comments/zcp2qy/my_aussie_has_anxietyaggression_issues/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zcp2qy/my_aussie_has_anxietyaggression_issues/,2466954,1670195409,0,,False,1670195425,1670195425,2022-12-04 23:10:09,,,,,

We've started putting them away in our bedroom when we leave so they aren't in the front of the house to hear us pull up in the driveway , but as soon as we come inside and they hear us they start barking like crazy . I've tried yelling at them and that is useless . Recently we've tried ignoring them , but if they're in the bedroom they will keep barking for 10+mins until I let them out . I try to avoid eye contact and not talk to them when we come home , but if I'm home when my partner gets home they will bark from the time they hear the car to the time he walks inside ...

969,dogs,"My husband and I adopted our 3 year old golden retriever 6 months ago. The previous owners were not that physically active and would go out with him at best 40 mins a day. They did not have enough time to take care after him and that's why they decided to give him up for adoption.

Our dog is such a good boy. He is super friendly, joyful and energetic. At home we have never had any troubles with him.

However, when we go outside he gets overly excited - he pulls a lot when he's on the leash, frantically smells and freaks out when he sees other dogs. The latter is kind of problematic and dangerous as he absolutely wants to run towards other dogs. We've had the case a few times when he tried to run to other dogs who were on the other side of the street while cars were driving by and I am not strong enough to keep him under control. 

He is by no means violent and only wants to ""say"" hello to other dogs and smell them, however, outsiders would think of his behaviour as hostile I guess. This only happens when he is on the leash. When he's off leash, he is simply playful and interacts normally with other dogs.

We thought that if we give him enough physical activity and play time, this problem would go away. Our dog gets every day minimum 2 hours of time outside; in the weekends it's 4 hours. However, this did not help that much. That's why we decided to chemically neuter him and put a chip on him. It took 6 weeks until the chip started to work - we noticed that he was significantly calmer when outside and did not freak out when seeing other dogs. 

This lasted for about 2 months and now we have noticed he is overly excited when we go outside. I can barely control him and keep him from running to the other dogs.

We have talked to a lot of dog owners and most of them have told us that neutering has made their dogs much calmer.

My husband and I are thinking of neutering our dog but we are very insecure about it. If it doesn't work, we would be absolutely be heartbroken to have inflicted pain on him for nothing.

975,dogs,"I’ve never posted here so I’m sorry if I used the wrong flair! I’ve researched a little bit about this on google, but I would love to hear the opinions of actual dog owners.

I don’t actually have any dogs of my own yet, so I’m just asking because I’m curious. One day, which will probably be years from now, I’d love to adopt both a female Rough Collie and a female Australian Shepherd. I love how intelligent they both are, and I’d love to engage in the activities that usually come with herding breeds (like the mental and physical exercises that herding dogs usually require). However, I’ve done a little research on this. I’ve heard (just from google searches) that female herding dogs tend to be a little bit more aggressive/dominating than males are. I’ve heard lots of people say it’s best to have one female and one male instead of two dogs who are of the same gender, which wouldn’t bother me. Though I’ve heard that it’s all basically up to good training, but I’ve also heard that it’s simply in their nature and you can’t really do much about it. I’ve also heard stories about herding dogs trying to herd other herding dogs, but again, I also heard that it shouldn’t be a problem if you train them well. I heard it’s usually a bad idea to adopt two herding dogs at the same time, but I was planning on only adopting one at first anyways. 

I’m only wondering because I want to be as educated as possible before adopting my own dogs.

They later come back and say, in the future, ""you need to ask me permission before you can feed my dog and that is the same when I have kids in the future"". The other day we were giving the dog raw salmon and some cooked chicken and no complaints there. Honestly, I didn't even want the dog around in the first place in my home, after two days, the floors and carpet were full of dog hair and I would be cleaning it all myself, they never cleaned up after it. They would let the dog run onto the carpet with wet paws before wiping it with a towel. I was not even told in the first place of any dietary restrictions or other restrictions for that matter. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that the way the situation was handled, I felt disrespected with how I was told off in a passive aggressive manner in my own home. The dog was polite and all but I'm thinking of just not letting them bring the dog over anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Was I wrong in this situation?

This seemed to do the trick and we put our other dog on it as well to make things easier. There have been no issues since.

My neighbors have a rottweiler, his name is captain. My neighbors let him run loose, even after I've called the police on them for it (we have a leash law, but his owner is a cop). He's your standard, giant rottweiler. The neighbors say since he doesn't bite people, why does he need to be in a pen all day while they're at work.

My dog is outside going to the bathroom and I toss her a treat for going outside, and this stupid dog comes from around the side of my house and charges, probably for the food. In a few seconds he has my dog ragdolled, shaking it around like a toy (she's 30 pounds, he's a German rottweiler) while my kid is crying and screaming, and I'm having to literally punch this dog repeatedly to get him to break free, my wife screaming ""Cap let her go"".

I took her to the vet today, we're discussing euthanasia due to the cost of patching her up and my financial situation. I went home to talk to the owners, these dumb hillbillies say ""well, he's never shown aggression at home. We don't own other dogs, but I don't think he would do that"".
